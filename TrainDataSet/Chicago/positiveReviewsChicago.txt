P => Impressive Impressive property  Service was what one would and should expect  Room was one of the best I have stayed in little subzero refrigerator kitchen stove and sink are a nice touch  or was understated and tasteful  The lobby bar was very nice with a great view of the river  Give the Trump a try  
P => Extraordinary What a difference a few months make  After a relatively disappointing stay at the Trump in the spring   the property was shockingly unfinished   I just returned from an extraordinary visit  This trip I booked a one bedroom river view suite took advantage of the excellent  restaurant and the fabulous spa  All told the hotel is incredibly well appointed the rooms are beautiful has a wonderful friendly and accomodating staff and has what many five star properties in Chicago lack   genuine sophistication  I usually stay at the Penninsula or The Four Seasons  but for this visit the Trump surpassed them both  
P => Wow Wow Wow This by far is one of the best hotels out there  The spa rooms are beautiful  We had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the river  The bathrooms are luxurious and include fancy shampoos and my favorite the sugar body scrub  We had a TV in the mirror and a flat screen in the main room  The closet had a towelcompress heater which was nice to use in bed after our showers  The service was like no other  He must send these professionals to quotNicequot school because there wasnt one person that wasnt friendly and helpful which is hard to find  I had a drink in the Rebar also the waitress was kind  The view with the dim lighting was relaxing  We also visited the pool gym and spa on our last day  All are located on the  floor  While waiting for my massage a gentleman asked if I would like tea made from fresh loose leaf  I lined but it smelled nice  The gym has state of the art equipment  My husband said it was the nicest he had seen  We were traveling with our   year old and he too felt welcome here  They loved children  Housekeeping sent up his own robe and slippers that said quotTrump Kidsquot how cute  The last day Trump and his family arrived for the opening of the residence side of the building  I wish I would have had the chance to tell him what a great job he did with this hotel  We will stay here every time we visit Chicago  
P => Simply the best I dont like Donald Trump but I loved his hotel  This is a fairly new addition to Chicago and what a step up Its right along the Chicago River with lovely river and lake views  You can see Navy Pier as well and I can imagine get a great view of the fireworks  We had an Executive King Suite  These rooms are located on the upper floors of the hotel and have secured elevator access  Our room was huge approx  square feet  There was a large open living dining and kitchen area   with a fully equipped kitchen  There is a large bedroom and a luxurious bathroom with integrated television inside the mirror  My son said it was quotmagicquot  I have to agree  The furnishings and ambiance are modern and luxurious  Its a great place to stay with children  They greeted my kids with cotton candy  They also provided a crib with lovely linens although the crib itself was somewhat smaller than full size  The staff were so friendly and lovely with the kids from the front desk to the doorman  I look forward to returning to this lovely hotel  
P => Absolutely loved it Without a doubt this is the best hotel Ive ever stayed in  I was absolutely gutted to be leaving although that would have something to do with Chicago being such a great place too The staff were great  Helpful and friendly and couldnt do enough for you The room was magnificent  Exactly as the website shows  Fantastically clean and with every amenity you could want The spa was great  It never seemed too crowded and had a ent sized pool The bar rebar was excellent and the barman was superb  We had a slight problem with some bar snacks and we were comped our drinks for the rest of the evening as an apology   a little touch that makes all the difference The restaurant sixteen is lovely  Massive panoramic windows look out over Chicago while you dine on great food and wine  Yes its expensive but hey its a Trump restaurant what do you expectWhen we stayed the tower was still being finished hence the buy one night get one night free deal that we got but the construction was on the top floors  floors away and we never heard a peep of noise or had our stay disrupted in any way I was expecting the place to be too garish and a little overwhelming in an extravagant Donald Trump style but it was nothing of the sort  Understated elegance is how I would describe it  Quite simply we had an amazing time and I cant wait to go back  
P => A first class experience We are a family of fourand stayed for  nights at the Trump Tower in ust of this year We stayed in a one bedroom king apartment overlooking the City The accommodation was first classnewand spotlessly clean It was also huge  sq feettwo plasma TVsa fully stocked kitchenand two bathroomsall luxuriously appointed Oh there is also a TV in the mirror in the bathroom if you wish to catch up with the news whilst soaking in the bathMaid service each day was efficient and unobtrusiveas was turn down in the evenings The gym facilities are first class and were under used by the other guests during our stay The pool must be the best that I have ever seen in a luxury hotel  yardswith a dedicated lane at one sideand not too warm It was never crowdedand I must have had the pool to myself on at least half a dozen occasions for lap swimming The hotel staff are attentiveif at times a little over enthusiastic I dont remember opening a door for myself the whole time that I was there One word of advice ask the staff to explain how the lighting system works in the rooms it is not easy to fathom it outbelieve me We had the air con go down one daycalled the hotel servicesand within  minutes the engineer was there fixing it great service We did not eat in the hotel restaurantpreferring instead to explore those nearby the hotel none disappointed It is so central for all of Chicagos attractionsthe theatresmuseumsand beachesaswell as shoppingof course A Hertz car hire is also literally across the road from the entrance I would highly recommend this hotel We had very mildly intrusive building work noise a couple of morningsbut nothing that one would complain about atalland if my credit card could stand it once againI would definately choose this hotel for my next trip to Chicago  
P => Great but some problems The Trump Hotel is a beautiful hotel  However be forewarned that it is still under construction and not expected to be completed until ch   We stayed on the th floor and did not encounter any noise or problems with the construction  The front desk clerk advised us that the roof had been installed the week before and the balance of the work entailed finishing the interior of the top floors  The room itself is spacious and very well appointed  The linens are excellent as is the built in television in the bathroom mirror  Some silly touches such as a water menu and grossly overpriced room service  We encounterd a number of problems which merit mentioning  One we had massages at the hotel spa which were nice although very expensive  My wifes massage cost   for an hour and a half  We discovered upon checking out that the hotel automatically charges a   gratuity for spa services  We were never told of this charge in advance  We also were charged an additional   for our room on checking out  When I enquired about the basis for the charge as I had already prepaid the room in full I was told it was a mistake  No explanation was offered how this mistake was made  Not very professional for a  star hotel  Second on the first day of our stay we had the unpleasant experience of hotel staff walking unannounced into our room  First it was the maid then it was a porter bringing us a bottle of wine  When we returned from dinner we discovered a cake in our room  Once again our room had been accessed by staff without our knowledge or consent  It caused us a little concern for our valuables although they were safely stored in the room safe  Third my wife and me went to the lobby bar and sat at a table for four beside the window overlooking the river  Bar was busy but not full  Nice but a little pretentious  The waitress first asked us if we were dining and when we indicated we only wanted drinks she stated that the table was reserved for a party of four  No reservation sign on the table  We frankly did not believe her  She offered us a lousy table at the back which we lined  We were put in the embarassing position of having to walk out of the lobby bar although were were paying guests of the hotel  My wife heard the waitress lhing with another server as we walked out  The concierge was no help at all  Overall though a beautiful hotel and very well located  I would probably return in the future  
P => Five Star Trump The Trump Tower is still under construction and will be for another year  So to get to the hotel you have to walk through scaffolding  But aside from that the hotel is just as advertised a five star Trump hotel  The rooms are privately owned condos so they have small functional kitchens  There are no balconies but there are small venting windows that open  Everything in the hotels is a solid  star level  The personnel are all over you and are very professional  The hotel location is at the foot of the Magnificent Mile which is great in the day but a little quiet at night  I guess my only criticism of my stay is the view from my room was mostly of an adjacent office building no lake views  Also at the present time there is no outdoor seating for the restaurant or any other part of the hotel  The health club and pool are indoor and both have a great views of the city  There is also complementary wifi in your hotel room  One of the highlights of my stay is the complementary Nespresso Machine that was in my room with refills supplied daily  If you are not familiar with this machine it makes coffee a cup at the time by putting in a small capsule containing different types of real not instant coffee  So when you get up in the morning turn on the machine plug in a coffee capsule and in about  seconds you have a cup of freshly brewed coffee or espresso  I loved it so much I ordered the machine while I was there  So my sumy is that the hotel is a true  star hotel with a Trump touch of class and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in downtown Chicago  
P => Trump Hotel an Experience in Itself My first time to Chicago and we stayed at the Trump Hotel  The hotel was the best part of the trip  The staff was so attentive and made us feel so extraordinary  In a day when customer service is at a low Trump Hotel excels  Every time we walked in the door it was held open and we were greeted by all of the staff  The room was always so clean and our turndown service made us feel special  Every little detail from the T V  in the mirror to the espresso maker was above and beyond  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  Especially people like myself who would not think that they could afford a hotel like this  Trump hotel made paupers like ourselves feel like royalty in a lavish palace  Thanks Donald  Job well done  
P => Not Yet Ready for Prime Time But Almost We enjoyed a lovely anniversary weekend in Chicago  God I love that city We stayed at the new Trump International Towers perfectly located at the south end of N Michigan Avenue at the river  The hotel has only been open for a few months and it has a few minor wrinkles to iron out but all in all it was a lovely experience  Our hotel of choice is usually The Peninsula and while The Trump is not equal to our venerable favorite it did come close in many ways  We had a very large room with a large sitting area and a kitchenette with a fabulous view of the river and Lake Michigan from the rd floor  The suite was orated in muted shades of grey with dark furniture and mohair upholstered pieces  The bathroom was very big with a lovely deep porcelain soaker tub and a arate glassed shower  Despite the generous size of the bathroom it was curious that the vanity only had one sink rather than two  Also of note was that in a hotel of this caliber the kleenex and toilet paper were cheap one ply products  Also surprisingly there wasnt a full length mirror in the suite Amenities were excellent and top quality as were the linens furnishings and electronics  High speed wireless Internet access was fast and free  They had serious elevator problems which they were trying to deal with throughout our visit  Service was ahem uneven  On Saturday at  p m  housekeeping had not visited our room despite our early  a m  departure  The service in Rebar great name for a bar and a bar with a great river view was horrible and required frequent gesticulations to enquire about our appetizers theyd been forgotten or a second drink or the requested glass of ice  The service at breakfast was equally abysmal  We were only one of three occupied tables but the blase waitress made mistakes on all of our orders forgetting items or getting details incorrect  No coffee or water refills were offered either  The concierges also varied in skill  One woman didnt have a clue about anything we asked her and she even gave us incorrect directions   turn left which should have been right but thankfully a young man came to her rescue and saved the day with a fantastic lunch recommendation  The door and front desk staff and all the staff we encountered in the hallways as well as housekeeping other than on Saturday were terrific  Would we return Yes we would  We have faith theyll get the kinks out  
P => Good hotel needs to sort out the service Stayed in a suite great room amazing view and very well fitted out  But still seems to be full of teething problems in the service  Reception is veruy slow and always seems overwhelmed by the number of people waitingcalls  Two days running they forgot to make up the room which is pretty unforgivable at the price  Lets hope they sort the service out as it has the potential to be the best hotel in Chicago  
P => Classic Trump  loved the hotel Although Chicagoans  be hesitant about accepting the Trump Tower as part of the architectural fabric of the city it is a terrific hotel with a great location  We frequent  Seasons or equivalent in most cities and have very high expectations and taste  The Trump Hotel in Chicago exceeded our expectations even while being constructed which did not interfere with our visit at all  From a warm welcome by Stephanie to very attentive staff including terrific doormen we were very impressed  The rooms are very comfortable and modern  check out the mirror with a tv in it  very cool  We had adjoining rooms with our twin teenagers who gave the hotel two thumbs up When we return to Chicago the Trump Hotel will be in our plans  
P => best hotel in america stay anywhere else in chicago and youll be making a mistake  pick a category and this hotel has it knocked  there was nothing to complain about  loved every minute of it  the room was outstanding and the service was even better  they are the best and treat everyone like a celebrity  way to go donald you rule  
P => Extrordinary Hotel The Trump Hotel Chicago is amazing Our room was more like an elegant condominium rather than a hotel room  The fully equipped kitchenette was a nice touch  The health club is out of this world with high end equipment  For some reason cell phone service was very poor in this building   many of my collegues had the same issue This is THE hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago  
P => Great hotel great location My wife  month old son and i stayed at the Trump for  nights  It shouldnt make any difference but the building is still under construction  This didnt impact the hotel at all other than the scaffolding outside the building  No noise or other inconvenience  Ive stayed in only a few other really high end hotels and this was definitely the best  The staff was very friendly and greeted my son by name several times  The room was huge sf and had all sorts of neat quotextrasquot quot LCD tv tv build into the bathroom mirror fully stocked kitchenette with very nice items Bose clock radio with iPod dock electric curtains very comfortable bed  Bath products are top notch  My wife said quotthis is the first hotel Ive been where I wasnt skeeved out about the sheets and never saw a single hair in the bathroom quot The only complaints and you have to take them in reference to the hotel being  star are that there were some ks on the walls as if luggage had rubbed and the turn down service never returned one day and had to be called the nd day  Minor issues for sure but if youre talking about a  star hotel thats a high standard  Id definitely recommend it but I also have to say we got a very good price of about  per night  I dont think Id pay the usual rate of  or more per night for ANY hotel  
P => Loved the hotel HATED THE RACIST DOORMAN  We recently stayed at the Trump hotel in e  I am originally from Chicago and we wanted to visit our family who live further north on Lake Shore Drive  We got a river view suite and I think it was about   a night I have to say the hotel is STUNNING Our initial room was great but noisy there is still ongoing construction  The front desk at the Trump obliged in giving us a new room and it was breathtaking  Everything is very modern and new and in keeping with the sleek modernity that you would see at hotels like the Mercer in NYC  sleek but not overwhelming or intimidating  The room had the BEST Chicago view  Navy Pier and the Chicago River and it was mostly unobstructed and endless  And a real bonus was that the windows open just a bit  we are sticklers for fresh air  That allowed just enough air in without there being a hazard for those of you with small children The room one bedroom apartment was clean and roomy and had everything you could want we had a suite that had two full baths with absolute top of the line fixtures  amenities like a television in the mirror I want that for home ble showers AND arate baths  There was a full kitchen with top of the line appliances Miele dishwasher for example and also free Nespresso which would be a real bonus for families for children Speaking of children when we notified the hotel that we would have a baby visiting us for the day they immediately put not only a great crib in our room but a high chair a diaper genie and soap and lotion etc  for the baby  We really appreciated that gesture The swimming pool is also great for kids and they are very friendly there and will provide swimming noodles and amenities for those with small children  Adjacent to the swimming pool btw with a breathtaking view the SpaFitness room is absolutely top of the line  brand new and plentiful equipment Pilates classes and fresh water fruit infused and bottled  The last day we were there they replaced the bottled water with Trump Ice water which had a picture of Donald Trump on it  We thought it very funny  It is so neat to exercise in a great location high up overlooking all of Chicago The restaurant however is a work in progress  The staff was not yet fully trained the water tasted like chlorine and they kept trying to fill my glass with it even though we had bottled water and the menu was HORRIBLY expensive   for an entree but not inspired  We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what to order because nothing sounded interesting enough to pay for  Before we were finished it was clear they wanted us to leave and started to fold linens in our vicinity which seems strange when you are paying   for dinner  But the view is great However the fact that I liked the hotel as much as I did makes me sad to continue this review and end up only giving this hotel  stars  The first incident that blew our minds was what will be known in our family as the quotracist doorman incidentquot  On the early afternoon of Friday e th it began to rain just as my family stopped by to pick us up for lunch  Earlier in the day I had gone out and it had rained and I asked for an umbrella at the first counter where the doorpersons are stationed  They happily obliged one person was a nice older African American woman with braids  I returned the umbrella as we came in and thought nothing of it At about p m  however when I asked for two umbrellas we were now a motley group of  toddlers and  adults without an umbrella amongst us the same woman manning the door attempted to go behind the desk and retrieve them but the man behind the counter looked at us stopped her and said  We are all out of umbrellas  If you need an umbrella you will have to go up to your room to get one   Fair enough  We understood that if it was raining umbrellas  be in limited supply  My husband went upstairs to get an umbrella  But in the meantime the same man behind the counter took out all these new umbrellas and started unwrapping them They were there all alongWhat was more HUMILIATING was that he came from behind the counter and gave an umbrella each to two white women who hadn t even left the lobby and HADNT EVEN ASKED FOR THEM YET I was shocked but I was actually more humiliated  Both my  year old dhter and my  year old mother asked me why the man said there were no more umbrellas when clearly there were  How could I tell my dhter there were no more umbrellas for people like us Did he not like us because we were the wrong color or because he didnt think we were worthy of the hotel I have my suspicions but dont you think that was awful At least the African American co worker who was clearly embarrassed then proceeded to go behind the counter and give us all umbrellas  But he really ruined my day and I felt really low  I thought about why he would do such a thing in front of my family all day That same day at  I went down to ReBar their signature bar that they tout as serving exotic cocktails for a quick cocktail with my sister  I felt we were both dressed well she was in a summer dress and I was in a pucci dress  When we sat down a waitress came to us and said quotIm sorry but this table is bottle service only after pm  My sister responded that it was only   The waitress served us but you could tell she wasnt happy about it  I can tell you that we looked like everyone else in the bar the bar btw skews middle aged and distinctly suburban I definitely was one of the younger people there  My sister who already had the quotumbrellaquot incident started talking about how she felt uncomfortable being there and so as soon as the drink came we took it upstairs  But the kicker is that my husband and myself came back an hour and half later and guess what The couple now sitting in the same seats we had earlier occupied was just drinking simple cocktails Where was the bottle service Beats me Initially I was willing to believe that these two incidents were an aberration and that there is no pattern  No one wants to accuse a hotel of something like casual racism in this day and age  But after speaking with the manager I am not so sure  They say all behaviors emanate from the top and if this is the case I have to say the manager could do a better job at dispelling my suspicions When I wrote the manager about this both he T  Colm O Callaghan and his assistant manager Jerome tried repeatedly to contact me  I assumed that they were contacting me to apologize but what actually ended up happening is that Mr  OCallaghan at first apologized and then tried to intimate that I had misread the situation  He kept trying to tell me that what happened didnt happen He said they simply ran out of umbrellas HELLO I was there They NEVER ran out of umbrellas the guy just didnt want to give us the umbrellas he had He kept trying to spin it as a misunderstanding but this guy just didnt want to waste his dwindling resources umbrellas on the likes of us As for the bar incident he said that certain areas have bottle service after a certain hour  But when I told him that hour hadnt been reached she didnt want to serve us at pm because she said bottle service starts at  and when I came back an hour and half later the people now sitting at the same seats were just having cocktails he didnt want to talk about it  Weird  Instead of diffusing the situation he made me feel as if he didnt want to hear what really happened and that he thought I was a silly deluded person So in the end this hotel gets  stars  stars for the hotel amenities spaswimming poolfitness center view and most of the staff and one or none for the racist doorman waitress  and pretty insensitive manager  The restaurant was also not so great  
P => Good new hotel on Gold Coast Great new hotel  Service is first class  Room was very large with a full kitchen  We loved the espresso coffee machine  Enjoyed beverages at Rebar  Bathroom amenities were great and loved the in mirror HD TV  I do prefer totally arate shower and tub but this was a nice design  Comparing to Park Hyatt we do prefer the Hyatt instead although not taking anything against Trump  It is a great new addition to the luxury hotels in Downtown Chicago  
P => Warning   theft from room   protect your property Our stay at Trump Chicago started off as one of our favourite Chicago experiences  The room was fantastic and the front line staff exceptional  We were so pleased with the hotel and its facilities that after our second day we ided we would like to make this our quotgo toquot hotel in Chicago  This all changed on our third day  While getting ready for dinner my wife realized that she could not find her new designer shoes that she brought along  She knew exactly where she had left them the night before however after a very thorough search they failed to turn up  We contacted the front desk and while at dinner the room was checked again by hotel staff and security without success and it was determined that her shoes were quotremovedquot from the room while we were out earlier that day Although you might think that this in itself was enough to turn us off the hotel it was how the managment handled or lack of the situation  We were told that we would be contacted by the quotDirector of Front Officequot the following morning and he was in a postion to resolve this matter  We waited most of the next morning to be contacted by Paul quotSquot and after leaving  messages for him we were informed by security that he was quottoo busy to deal with this situationquot  OK   lets get this straight   the Manager of a five star hotel is too busy to deal with the theft of a guests personal belongings from the room Are you serious Motel  offers better trained managers Ive never really stayed at Motel  and we have yet to hear from anyone regarding this matter The Trump Hotel offers guests a fantastic experience and its design and dedication of the front line staff need to be noted  The management however is an embarrasment to the Trump name and should get the quotYOUR FIREDquot 
P => Excellent splurge weekend After a two night stay at the Trump to celebrate a special occasion my wife and I now have a new favorite hotel for our getaways from the suburbs to downtown Chicago  Over the years weve tried a lot of the major hotels   the Four Seasons Peninsula Park Hyatt Ritz Sofitel Drake and others   and while theyre all nice we think the Trump has the most going for it  First of all the location is perfect just a block off of the Magnificent Mile an easy few blocks to the center of the Loop or to River North galleries and nightlife and a very nice stroll to Millennium Park or the lakefront  Its in the middle of everything but still above most of the city noise two sides of the building are more or less bordered by water  The views of the lake river andor city are unbeatable Everyone we encountered on the staff was friendly hospitable and surprisingly unpretentious   including at the top notch restaurant Sixteen  For such a classy property the snoot factor was really low which made it all the more relaxing And our room was extremely comfortable  Lots of elbow room high ceilings huge windows a great bed and unbelievably every room has at least a small kitchen ours had a fridgefreezerice maker sink dishwasher microwave and cooktop  Our bellman said that some guests actually do bring in food and cook in a touch of home that we did not take advantage of but if we had kids with us that kitchen could have come in very handy Although the building construction is continuing way above the hotel space you really couldnt tell the only things that gave it away were the scaffolding over the front entrance and the occasional lifting or lowering of building materials way up on the  th floor  At one point we saw a construction Porta Potty being hoisted past our th floor window which was a little disconcerting but thats it We had a perfect getaway and will definitely look forward to returning to the Trump  But for now its back to real life    
P => Best location in Chicago I wanted to try this new luxury property in Chicago  Ive stayed at the Peninsula the Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt and other lesser rated properties and I was looking forward to comparing the Trump to these fine accommodations First the good  Location location location By far the best feature of the hotel is its scenic perch on the river close to the Michigan Avenue scene AND the loop stuff like Millenium Park and the Art Institute  Right now it is a bit tough to find and walk around because of ongoing construction but this should be no problem when it is finished Second even the standard rooms are huge  I was on the th floor in a city view deluxe room  The view was forgettable but the quality of the interior was impressive  I especially liked the high end ktichenette with a microwave SubZero fridge Meile stove etc  There are even cooking utensils pans and dishesNow the not so good  Even though the room is large and luxurious I found it a bit sterile  The slate color scheme should be brightened up a bit with a dash of red roses or something else to break up the slate monotony  The duvet on the bed was very thick and the ac didnt seem to work so well so it was a bit stuffy  I took a tour of the spa and fitness center but didnt partake of any service or activity  I had no meals at the hotel either The one downside of my stay was the construction noise that started early in the morning  I know that I paid a soft opening rate of  because of the construction but I had hoped that there would be a minimal amount of noise  Not so    they were pumping concrete up to the th floor and there was a  second interval pounding in the core of the hotel that did not stop  When I checked out I told the front desk person about this and she apologized  I actually checked out early because the pounding was so annoying All in all the Trump is a fine choice for Chicago but if you are looking for lavish extensive public areas and a bit of warmth in the guest rooms Id suggest the Four Seasons or Peninsula  
P => Trump Tower   Chicagos best hotel  We have just completed our third stay Trump and felt compelled to pass along our highest praises for this exciting addition to Chicagos hotel scene   The staff at Trump are very professional and friendly you would think the hotel had been open for years then you look up and see the cranes still working on the upper floors   The construction is not an issue but it will be great when they are able to open the outdoor areas of the restaurant and river walk   Anyway for us who have stayed numerous times at the Penninsula and the  Seasons we now have a new favorite hotel in Chicago  it s just more fun   Trump   Great job to the management and all employees that make this such an exciting new hotel   I cant wait for all the finishing touches to be completed at which time I think universal praise will place Trump at the top of the list for luxury hotels in Chicago  
P => Weekend without children We stayed at the hotel for a weekend   leaving the kids behind at home so we were just looking for a nice relaxing weekend The hotel was great  I was expecting over the top luxury but instead found it very understated and modern Besides the scaffolding at the entrance there is no other evidence of construction Contrary to some of the other reviewers opinion I found the staff very attentive and courteous  Theyre not in your face but theyre there if you need something I am about  months pregnant and I was asked if there was anything they could do to help me with any cravings to just give them a call The rooms are huge and very convenient  Wonderful shower wonderful bed the kitchenette is helpful The concierge was helpful and was even able to get us last minute tickets to shows albeit at a very inflated priceRoom service however was very disappointing  I didnt order the  Trump dinner menu yes  but the food I ordered twice was well below average Location of the hotel was great  Its walking distance to almost everything and the building is so tall that even with my bad sense of direction I could always find my way back Theres also a wonderful restaurant called Vermilion just a  minute walk from the hotel  
P => The Trump didnt disappoint When youre paying the kind of rates that are charged at a hotel of this caliber you expect a certain level of quality and service  The Trump didnt disappoint in either area  We stayed here to celebrate my husbands birthday for  fabulous days in what is literally an apartment that is arguably located in one of the best areas of the city  We walked to Navy Pier the Lake and Michigan Ave  shopping to name a few city hot spots  Because the Trump sits on a bend in the Chicago River it has a fantastic vantage point  We had a suite with floor to ceiling windows that showcased a view of the river and Lake Michigan  Unfortunately the buildings upper floors were still under construction during our stay and the windows were in need of a wash  However other than the dirty windows and a little water dripping off the overhead construction scaffolding set up at the hotels entrance we were never disturbed by the construction  The accomodations are top of the line everything  Good linens very comfortable bed and robes and slippers are provided  I like this touch  The suites have a full kitchen that comes complete with espresso maker hot water kettle I drink tea and really appreciated this extra dishes glassware silverware pots and pans a full refrigerator dishwasher etc  The suite we reserved had a dining table that seated  and a large comfortable living room with flat panel TV Bose Ipod docking station and a deskwork area with unlimited free internet  We felt like we were staying at a friends very luxurious apartment  The bedroom was arate from the living area with its own bath complete with waterfall tub arate rain shower and two sinks  There was also a powder room located off the living area  This was great for our needs because we had guests come up to our suite after we hosted a small party in the Grand Salon one of the Trumps banquet rooms  Our private party experience also went beyond my expectations  The Grand Salon has a modern zen elegance the food was simply gourmet all the way the service was impeccable and there was that amazing view again  The event planner was professional and handled the smallest details efficiently  The only small disappointment was the bartender  He didnt seem to know how to mix certain drinks but this could have been a result of the bar only being stocked with certain liquors  We didnt take advantage of the spa but did use the fitness center which was also top of the line  The treadmills actually had aromatherapy fans Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel especially for a special occasion  It certainly made our celebration more memorable  
P => Loved the Trump I brought my dhter to the Trump to celebrate her th birthday  She was in for a surprise because she thought we were staying at the Hyatt  I let the hotel know it was her birthday and upon check in they wished her a Happy Birthday  We had a standard room but it was beautiful and modern  We had a nice city view and loved the mini kitchen  We also loved the espresso machine After getting settled into our room as we were putting things away room service showed up with a small birthday cake that was a raspberry mouse very nice touch We did a lot of sightseeing for three days and although the weather was not that great we loved being able to just walk around on Michigan Avenue take the free trolley over to Navy Pier and catching cabs here and there  We went to Cafe Babareba the first night and loved it great flavored sangria saw Blue Man Group for the rd time but still loved it shopped on Michigan Avenue very convenient to the hotel had lunch at Giordanos and one day on the th floor of the John Hancock building had dinner at Nne be a little overrated but ok and went to the Field Museum  After shopping on Saturday we did go to the pool area and loved it Aside from a beautiful view and lovely serene setting they have the Kohler shower you see on TV with all of the body sprays that even has different colored settings  We also enjoyed the steam and dry saunas and they even have a small bathing suit water extractor   very cool We went to Rebar one evening and I enjoyed a raspberry champagne while she enjoyed being in a trendy setting for a bit All in all we loved our stay there  We saw a family pull up in a rolls royce and tourists in jeans and t shirts and I think everyone was treated the same which was refreshing considering some high end places have employees that act as if theyre better than some of the guests Everyone was super friendly from the front desk staff to the doormen Well look forward to staying here again 
P => The hotel is amazing even the least expensive room is spectacular Even though the hotel is still under construction besides some work to the hotel drive in area I did not notice any noise or construction traffic  The reception area is modern and very Trump and as soon as I stepped out of our sedan we were immediately treated quotas royalty quot Our bags were swooped up and our room keys quickly distributed We had a Deluxe King City View room on the rd floor  I believe that this is the smallest and cheapest of the rooms  But as soon as we opened the room to the door we were blown away  The view to the city is unprecedented and every detail of the room is upgraded even compared to a luxury hotel  The bathrooms are huge deep soaking tubs lay adjacent to a rain showerhead and shower area all enclosed in semi frameless glass doors  THERE IS EVEN A FLAT SCREEN TV IN THE BATHROOM MIRRORThe room was amazing Simply SpectacularMy wife and I also tried out the Trump Spa we both booked  minute Trump Massages  They were the best massages that we both have ever received  I highly recommend the Trump Massage  And arrive a little early so you can enjoy the other Spa amenities and the relaxing lounge area The location is also perfect right in downtown just a few blocks from the best shopping in Chicago I highly recommend this hotel and I hope that the rates do not go up too much once construction finishes so that I can come back for my next trip to Chicago  
P => Awesome From when you check in to when you check out you will be treated like Donald himself Visited Chicago for a weekend in il  Weather was perfect and the hotel could not have been any better  We got upgraded to a suite over looking the river and the lake  They are still building the upper floors but you would not have known unless you looked up  The spa is a great experience  Just the pool and shower alone is worth the short elevator ride Sixteen is the best meal I have had in a long time  I highly suggest the tasting menu  Worth every penny  
P => Crisp and Modern Reasuringly Nonpretentious HUGE ROOMS Booked a room at the Chicago Trump on Valentines Day  The hotel hadnt officially opened yet and so scored a great rate on the grand deluxe  bedroom suite  To be honest I really wanted to hate this hotel but upon my nights stay I have to admit that it is instantly competitive with Chicago s finest five star properties  The lobby is small and check in was quite pleasant  Readily available employees everywhere you look but nonintrusive at the same time  or is very pleasant  very minimalist and modern and everywhere you look there are panoramic views of the Chicago skyline river and lake Michigan  Suite was HUGE   SQ feet could have entertained   easily  Floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views see pix and great full kitchen with everything you d need to make five star meal they actually offer in room chef service  Recommend both Sixteen and ReBar for views and food that compete with other fine dining establishments as well as hotel bars  Can t wait for Sixteen s patio to open summer of   
P => Hoped for more at this high end Trump Hotel My husband and I stayed at Trump for our th wedding anniversary this past weekend  I had high expectations however many of them were not met based on the ratings of the hotel  We live in the suburbs of Chicago and are well traveled  The ProsLocation is fabulous especially if you are not from Chicago you can walk to just about everything and the cab rides are short if you prefer to take one The room is gorgeous The bed is one of the best weve ever stayed in and the mini full kitchen was great for heating up our left overs the next day  We found the amenities to be well thought out and well appointed  Plus the touches like framed photos in the room were very chic and homey at the same time You will never find a better bathrobe in your life  They accommodated our bikes which we drove in with to do a biking event and kept safely down near the security office  No problems The ConsWe booked an elaborate VIP spa package the massages were about a  in quality but that is subjective Im sure and the fancy baths that were drawn for us could have cooked a lobster they were so hot  I had to run ice cold water in it for  minutes straight to make it manageable   and for  for this treatment I didnt expect to have to draw my own bath  Very disappointing The service was   cool  No one was rude or impolite but as I mentioned before we stayed for  nights in a deluxe room for our  year anniversary and despite wanting to know the special reason for our stay when we booked the room they did nothing with this information  For touting this level of service we were both disappointed that no effort was made to go above and beyond  Faulty charges were on our room with little to apologize or compensate for us catching the  error Overall I wont be running back to spend this kind of cash at this facility  The restaurant at Sixteen is stunning although we did not dine there  The excitement of being at a Trump facility left something to be desired as we expected more from this high class hotel  
P => Will definitely be back Stayed at the Tump Tower over holiday weekend  I traveled with my husband and my  month old son  Absolutely loved the property   the rooms are spacious and the kitchenette is indispensable when traveling with a young child  Staff was extremely accommodating especially at the restaurant Sixteen  Whether in town for business or pleasure I will stay here again given the propertys perfect location spacious rooms and excellent service  
P => Perfect for children We just returned from a weekend stay with our  year old for our th wedding anniversary  The hotel was the perfect luxury accomodations that you would expect  Complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries were waiting for us in our room  The hotel staff was completely attentive and every little detail was covered when it came to our child  The room was equipped with a real crib diaper genie high chair baby bath products  including rubber duckies and a stuffed animal for him to keep  For us adults the extra large suite allowed us to have our own space while traveling with a toddler  The pool was great also with swim diapers and baby toys  The restaurant was gorgeous and completely accomodating  There is a little cosmetic disadvantage with the construction still going on above and the street noise was not completely filtered but it was worth it  Perfect stay with no complaints  
P => Great Hotel but Weak Service Great new hotel in Chicago my first time there  I have to say that the rooms are big and nice interior but the hotel service really lacks  Not what you expect from a five star hotel most staff not very friendly and for some reason alot of staff dont know basic information about anything  The best part of the stay was though when the concierge booked us a restaurant which has been closed for  months really funny to get to the place and there is nothing there  Otherwise a really good stay hope the service improves  
P => The best hotel in Chicago After having stayed in this great hotel I am not surpised that all the reviews for it are so good  Our room was huge with great views  The service was excellent  To sumise a really wonderfull hotel which is of an equal standard of the  Seasons  
P => Pretty Great Had an incredible stay this week The hotel is almost complete with construction and Is absolutely beautiful Upon check in we had requested and booked adjoining rooms We were shown to the room and It wasnt adjoining We had even asked them at the desk to confirm this and It still wasnt correct However the bellman was so professional and offered us to sit in the room and offered to make us coffee while we waited for the desk to find our correct rooms The rooms were located and simply perfect The rooms are very modern and HUGE They each have mini sub zero and miele dishwashernot sure why anyone needs thisbut Its greatThe room also had a super easy espresso machines for a quick cup in the mornings The bathrooms are awesome and my favorite part The typical TV in mirror that you see at most upscale hotels these daysfinally put one in at homeThe shower and bathtub is side by side behind a glass wall The lighting and drapes are all controlled electonically and easy to operate The flat screen TV didnt work and the maintenence dept  came directly up with a new TV and were efficient and and quick with the installation The staff is well trained and always greet you with a quotWelcome backquoteach time you return I booked a massage a was a bit disappointed A female should always have another female show her around the spa With that in mindI checked in for the massage and had a very nice man show me to the door of the ladies locker room and went away I was alone in the locker and didnt have a robe in my locker and had to get completely dressed to go back to the desk to ask where to get the robe It was a little eerie in the locker because I was completely alone with NOBODY around  Ater a mediocre massage I was shown back to the door of the locker room When walking back to the showers I had to weave around a group of people being given a tour of the spawith the group of business people in suits Those of you people who get massages understand how you look after the treatment I felt very uncomfortable  I dont know be thats just me The hotel is amazing and you wont be disappointed Go soon before It stays booked year round as It surely will  
P => This Place is Awesome I stayed at Chicaos newest luxury hotel in ch and was absolutely blown away  Not being a huge Donald Trump fan I was sketical until the moment I walked in the lobby when I knew this place was special Although the  story building was not yet complete the Hotel had just opened as it occupies only the bottom now completed  floors From the staff at check in to the   sqft standard rooms everything was first class all the way   ever seen a Sub Zero mini fridge All fine Italian furniture Bose CD player on nightstand IPOD doc flat screen TVs including one in the bathroom mirrorAlso full kitchens with Milet stove dishwasher even plates forks and knives   and I was in a standard room The views of the river and lake are nothing short of spectacular and as a frequent visitor to Chicago I can say with some authority that there is no hotel in the Chicago with views like this and no upscale hotel with all the modern ammentities this one has   and did I mention the rooms are hugeThe rates are still low considering until construction is complete in  and I definitely felt like I was getting a great deal even though I was still paying  a night   the rates supposed to go to  a night soon so make sure to take advantage of Chicagos newest gem with the best location in the city 
P => An amazing experience I had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend in il   after a weeks training outside Chicago  It was a truly enjoyable experience  I stayed in a double room with a kichen inc dishwasher fridge freezer coffee machine etc on the th floor overlooking the river  The views were spectacular and the room very spacious  Room facilities included a large bathroom inc TV in the mirror luxurious bathrobes Plasma tv iPod docking station comfortable bed desk with stationery supplies and beautiful interior design Customer service in the hotel was excellent  Overall the staff were friendly approachable and professional  I would recommend a visit to the spa on the th floor where I enjoyed the Trump Classic Massage  Also the restaurant  on the th floor served delicious food the sampliing menu is recommended with wonderful views  
P => You have to do this I had the opportunity to stay at the Trump for the evening of the th of urary  We were on the th floor with a standard room  The Room layout is great we had several people in the room to celebrate my Nieces birthday  We had a King Size bed with a sleeper sofa  Not everyone spent the night but at one point we had  grown woman and  toddlers in the room and never felt cramped  There was a  burner electric stove along with a dishwasher and sub zero mini fridge  The bathroom is the best there is a soaking tub that is out of this world  There is a television recessed into the mirror that you can view from the tub  The bathroom amenites are top notch  They offer slippers and an umbrella in your hall closet and the closet in the bedroom is huge by most hotel standards The bed was so comfortable and even the sofa bed was not bad  The room had a flat screen tv and a huge dresser that can double as a buffet when you are serving guests  They have an awsome array of serving pieces in the kitchenette  The staff is wonderful we lhed that we never opened a door for ourselves  The staff is well trained and show pride in their work  I think everyone we encountered really enjoyed their job  They had a sense of pride to being working at such a great hotel The only drawbacks we found were that the walls are flat paint and when the little ones touched the walls they left some prints  Also in the kichen area there is flat paint and as people reheat food or cook this could be a future problem  The pans are truely gourmet and if you do not have oil there is a huge sticking factor The room was not as child friendly as other places but this is the TRUMP so move the objects of art to a higher location We will be back    if you can splurge a little go for a one bedroom suite  You get a full HUGE bedroom  bathrooms and a full kitchen with a living room  
P => Take advantage of this amazing value while it lasts We live in downtown Chicago but ided to do a mini getaway at the Trump because the prices are roughly half what they will be when construction is finished and we wanted to experience it ourselves  We had a standard room which is generously proportioned about  sq  ft   It came equipped with a large flat panel HDTV and a flat panel TV built into the bathroom mirror   very cool little feature  All rooms also have a kitchenette with Sub Zero mini fridge a full size Miele dishwasher  burner Miele cook top a microwave and all the cookware utensils and service items you need  The fridge is nicely furnished but the attentive staff will customize it with whatever food and beverages you like  The room was nicely laid out with a king size bed and a sofa sleeper  Wireless internet and local calls are included in the price  The robes are plush and the Trump slippers are a good touch  The bathroom is nicely appointed with high quality toiletries and a unique granite showertub combo with rain shower head and a waterfall spout in the tub which is big enough to lounge in and has a good view of the in mirror TV  The furnishings and or in the room and throughout the hotel are highest quality  Very modern with dark woods and unique fixtures  In room theres an iPod docking station CD playerDVD player and a good selection of TV stations even Fox Sports which delighted my British husband  Theyll even bring up an X Box if youd like  We were on the th floor and never once heard any construction noise  Even though the hotel is still in soft open the staff was superb  Friendly gracious and went out of their way to help  The Trump obviously values service   it seems every corner we turned we encountered a training session  Its clear the staff are proud of the hotel and are quick to give a tour or point out a unique feature  We stayed with our  year old son  While this is not a family oriented hotel every single staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to accommodate our needs  They loan out strollers and any other baby item you can think of  By the end of the first day every staff member we ran into seemed to greet our son by name  The concierge is a fountain of knowledge  He gave us a dining recommendation that fulfilled our very specific criteria and it was perfect  He and the rest of the staff enthusiastically greeted us by name after the first introduction  The restaurant Sixteen is now open  The adjoining nightclub Re Bar isnt open yet but the bar is set up and serving and theres plenty of seating  As a Chicago native I can tell you    the view from the restaurantbar doesnt get any better than this  A beautiful outdoor veranda with circle around balcony  Fabulous views of the lake river and nearby historic architecture  This was really well planned  You practically feel like youre sitting under the towers of the Wrigley building  Food and service at the restaurant live up to the expectations of a fine dining experience  The chandelier is amazing the space is breathtaking We were fortunate enough to be there for the opening of the fitness center spa is not open yet  The fitness center is terrific with plenty of equipment including treadmills ellipticals spinning room studios for classes yoga mats etc  And all with floor to ceiling views of the skyline river and lake  The locker rooms are an experience in and of themselves  Again the staff went out of their way to accommodate and highlight all the features  The pool is a real treat  It just opened    we have the unique privilege of being able to say we were the FIRST people to swim at the Trump Tower in Chicago  Very serene setting nicely appointed and again with floor to ceiling views  There are sure to be a few glitches as they roll out but they try hard to compensate  We had a strange situation where  wine openers in a row broke when we used them the door man immediately came upstairs with his own personal wine opener that he had with him because a few other guests have had the same problem  Another downfall is the outrageous room service pricing  Its beyond Chicago luxury standards    even beyond New York standards  We felt compelled to order the  cheeseburger just to see what could possibly justify that price  Alas it was just a plain ordinary burger   not even on the big side  And the quality of room service dining was just acceptable not great  Prices in the restaurant are typical for a  star hotel but much more reasonable than room service Overall a great place  I hope they can maintain the standard of attention and service as more guests arrive  But this is a no brainer    go while the price is low its a truly first rate experience  Compared to other  stars weve stayed at like the Palace in NY the Phoenician and the Four Seasons all places we love this actually seems to take luxury a step further  
P => Treated like Trump himself I loved the large sized rooms Ill be coming back for more 
P => splendido  
P => 
P => A Beautiful Classic Club I think this probably says it all after recently staying at the ULC my wife and I ided to apply for membership  The ULC provides luxurious accommodations excellent food and friendly service at a reasonable price  One thing you must understand though is that this is a club dating from the late s with all the tradition that suggests  The demands on guests are not all that great simply that you dress somewhat less casually than what you can get away with elsewhere  In return you will be treated to an elegant experience you cannot match anywhere else in Chicago at any price  
P => vellous City Base and Wedding Venue We stayed at ULC for  nights running up to and including my stepdhters wedding  We were upgrade to a suite for the duration which proved extremely comfortable and useful for small family gatherings preparation of  wedding programmes storage of luggage as extended family came and went and necessary chill out time  I understand the rooms have been refurbished fairly recently  Ours was beautiful I am not a huge fan of classic styles but the muted gold sky blue and dark wood furnishings were understated classy and comfortable  Our room like all others I saw had a close view of the office building next door  Therefore not much natural light to be had so artificial light was necessary during the day  Our suite had boat loads of storage double wardrobe desk beside the bed two dressers two large flat screen TVs and a large bathroom with double sink  A small bar fridge was bought in on request great for fruit and nibbles  Common to all rooms large and small occupied by various family members was the sheer quality of the bed and linens  One of the most comfortable beds Ive ever had the pleasure of sleeping in  The mattress pillowtop had a down top as well  The feather pillows designated quotmediumquot and quotsoftquot were luscious  We had complimentary breakfasts in the Wigwam  Its priily a business environment particularly during the week so as the members of my large and raucous family began to arrive we risked upsetting the balance  However the staff were gracious and attentive  The Rendezvous Bar was also an excellent meeting and socialising spot with good sandwiches and a particularly nice Caesar Salad a whole grilled romaine with the usual accoutrements  We are casual people so were apprehensive about the dress code  Certainly during week days the tone is definitely all business  In the weekends jeans are allowed on Saturday mornings and all day Sunday so things loosen up a little  We personally were careful to respect the code and when we wanted to go more casual or have a run we simply used the athletic entrance a back door to the street but using the same lifts as everybody else  The gym changing rooms sauna pool etc were outstanding  I used the gym equipment almost every day and there were never more than  or  others there at the time Free Wifi was brilliant as was access to the business centre for printing etc  The library looked like a wonderfully serene spot only I had no time to enoy it  Location wise I have stayed all over the Loop and North Michigan and have usually preferred to be closer to the river  But the ULC is just  minutes walk from the river and a mere three blocks from the Art Institute which serendipitously had free admission for the week to celebrate the opening of the new Renzo Piano wing and Millenium Park  Easy to get a breath of fresh air and view of that fantastic skyline whenever we wanted  And as for the wedding    what a gorgeous venue for a wonderful event  And the bride and groom werent so shabby either ULC was great  Id love to be able to stay there again but I do believe there needs to be a membership connection the mother of the bride is a member  On value for money alone    even considering we were getting a good deal    we could not have done any better anywhere in Chicago  
P => My Favorite Place to Stay in Chicago I have stayed at the Union League three or four times now over the last two years and enjoy it more and more each time This  story private clubhouse has  suites and guestrooms three restaurants two bars various ballrooms private meeting rooms amazing food and a world class art collection  The health club is free to use and fills five floors of the building  It includes a pool steam sauna free weights cardio workout and just about whatever else you can think of The staff is very professional and very attentive The business center is first rate  It includes private offices and open carrels  The library is exactly what youd expect one to be like in a private club The location is in the heart of downtown so its convenient to the theater district Millennium Park shopping the lakefront and plenty of restaurants This isnt a quottrendyquot place by any stretch of the imagination and I wouldnt come here with a family of teenagers but its great for adults and small children  NOTE The Union League does have a business casual dress code no jeans gym shoes or t shirts unless youre going directly from your room to outside the clubhouse or vice versa  
P => Loved every bit of its past world charm I loved this place  The staff was EXCEPTIONALLY nice  The room was beautiful spacious although the bathroom was a little small  The lobby and the meeting rooms are wonderful exuding beauty and charm with wonderful paintings everywhere  What I especially liked was that this place obviously used to be very snobby and it still has tinges of that upper class feeling like selling cigars in the lobby but its gotten past that  I was at a conference that was largely African American and it felt great to have the people claim this wonderful place back from the upper classes The coat check desk is out of an old movie  Be sure to check your coat just to enjoy it Plus the very well equipped business center is open  and has computers printers all kinds of stuff  
P => An unexpected gem We were in town for a wedding and the reception was held here  The ballroom was stunning the food was wonderful and the staff were very accomidating  The hotel room had the most comfortable bed and the coffee shop across the street had the best expresso Be prepared to follow the dress code and enjoy a drink in the lounge and a more unique experience of Chicago  
P => Great stay We recently stayed at the Union League for  days for our sons wedding  The reception was held there  Accomodations were good and the food and service at the restaurants bar and reception were outstanding  Everyone was friendly and it made our stay enjoyable  We had several out of town guests staying there also and everyone was equally impressed  
P => Outsanding alternative to Chicago hotels I totally agree with the more recent reviews of The Union League Club those which rate it highly  Its a historic and beautifully appointed facility particularly the lobby and main dining room  Check its web site for the clubs dress code  Rooms are excellent   with wireless  and the staff is friendly and helpful  Location is right in The Loop close to the quotElquot lines the lake front Sears Tower and about six blocks from Amtrak  Nearly any place youd want to go downtown is within a miles walk north  And The Union League Club is a far better  deal than downtown commercial hotels  
P => First Class This Club is fantastic  I dont like snooty hotels and this club retains its elegance without feeling stuck up  Im going to be ried here in ust  and I cant wait The staff has been SO wonderful to my family and they are truly a joy to speak with on the phone  I live out of state and most of the planning has been remote so their expertise and orum is much appreciated  They have reated all the guest rooms and while they retain their old world style all of the fabrics and furnishings are impeccable and refined  Its as if you stepped right back into the s  This place is wonderful and I highly recommend it for a taste of true Chicago history  
P => Luxury but not like a hotel I just accompanied my husband here for a business meeting  It was a mixed bag but it was an overall good experience  I arrived after my husband and picked up keys at the desk  Very friendly and attentive staff  I had a very small room on th floor with no view  As mentioned before there was no frig no safe no ice on floor  Clean nice Gilchrist and Soames bath products great bed with two pillowtops and deluxe linens  My key malfunctioned twicw during my stay as did my husbands  Much later I discovered a snack and ice machine on another floor but you have to search diligently through your room service menu to find that   There is a good room service menu but no alcohol  There is the Rendezvous bar on th floor where you can order drinks charged to your roombut if youre alone you  feel out of place I had to dine and spend many hours by myself and felt out of place here at times I chose room service one night and the food was excellent  The food for our meeting was also good but I was disappointed that they did not offer a vegetarian option  I didnt touch the entree and no one said a word or offered any substitutions  This is the year  and there are many vegetarians on this planet thank you  The athletic facility was nice however if you wandered to the highest floor where the squash court was located it was filthy  There was trash and dirt all over the floor as if it had been abandoned for months  Also you have to go through a staff area to get to the workout room  The pool is NOT Olympic sized  it has to be  meters to meet that standard  It is  meters and roped off to  lanes  Nice for swimming but short  I loved all the huge meeting rooms and the amazing art throughout the building  Its on par with a small gallery and boasts a curator  However they do not have any tourist info in the lobby   no quotChicago This Weekquot magazines city maps etc  I did find those at the Washington Library a couple blocks away  Also we received a Wall Street Journal paper daily  Sorry but Id rather have a Chicago Trib with local news and a crossword puzzle  The area is nice but its rather focused on the DePaul crowd  Several local eateries such as the Chipotle Grill My Thai and the small Mexican restaurant are only open till  pm There were only  food options available on a Monday night in the entire block and those were Dunkin Donuts and Subway Be prepared to do some walking or take a cab  There is a very nice coffee shop across the street from the hotel  This makes up for the subpar coffee makers in the room and the lack of morning coffee in the club  You could go to the breakfast room but only if you are dressed to regulation not in your athletic gear  You are also required to use a arate exit if you are in your athletic clothes or golf shorts  In conclusion this is a lovely sophisticated place to stay but it lacks some of the things a traveler needs at times  I much prefer the Chicago Hilton and would prefer a place which fits the needs of a solo traveler  
P => A historic gem A co worker is a member at the Union League Club and she booked us two rooms for a recent conference stay in Chicago  The club is located in the theater district and boasts old world beauty but with very comfortable modern rooms  My room was a beautiful corner room with two queen sized beds  The bath amenities linens and bed quality were comparable to a four star hotel Both nights there we had drinks at the Rendezvous bar on the th floor  The service was attentive and friendly   lots of attention to detail but it didnt feel stuffy  Everyone from the wait staff to the front desk staff were incredibly friendly and personable The chocolate fondue at the Rendezvous was wonderful  We had to wait a while to receive it but the waiter was great about giving us updates on the delay and getting us drinks to make the time go by more pleasurably The experience was so positive that my husband and I are considering applying for membership next year  
P => Breakfast was awesome staff was great My conference host required that we stay at the Union League Club  Our information specified that we were NOT to dress less than casual  When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday there was a wedding going on  The staff and the guests were very snooty  I felt like I was at some exclusive gentlemans club and I felt very out of place I ided to eat breakfast in the Wigwam room  It was empty on Sunday so they showered me with attention and re folded my napkin every time I unfolded it  I began to feel like I was too uncouthed for the Union Club During the week real people arrived and the snootiness of the staff and guest reduced immensely  I even saw young people in the elevator which werent seen on the weekend In spite of the snootiness of the hotel I enjoyed my stay  The bed highlighted the inadequateness of my bed at home  Their bed was sooooo comfortable that I forgot I was in a hotel which NEVER happens when I stay at the SUPER  LOLIn addition to the nice bed the staff was wonderful  the front desk people Victor and Arie the bellman and the Wigman staff My concerns the uppity dress code is outdated  With the massive travel restrictions and baggage charges requiring people to dress up just to walk around a hotel seems a bit antiquidated and prudish to me The Rendevous staff were not friendly to me at all  I felt like I was in the Civil War era going into that restaurant The bathrooms size was ridiculous  The WHOLE bathroom was the size of my walk in closet at home and my house is only  feet  I felt choked by the bathroom everytime I had to go into it  I had to use the mirror in the closet to get ready The room lacked a refrigerator  All hotels are now providing refrigerators in hotel rooms in light of the rising food costs at restaurants and the need to bring leftovers to the room  Union Club needs to add small refrigerators in the room What I liked about the hotel  The comfortable bed  The central location to everything in downtown Chicago  The staff  The breakfast food in Wigwam  The newspapers that are provided to read  The walk in shower with the ble floor  The luxury robe provided for guestsetc  
P => Great   Well priced and wonderfully settled  Spent the day on business in the Union League  I must say the club is probably the best place I have every stayed  Wonderful atmosphere and a complete package  Free WiFi in your rooms  Clean  Old style charm  Check out the fitness facilities  They are just wonderful  Could not have asked for a better place to stay  Will stay there again  One note  This is a place with atmosphere and elegance  Children while welcome should be well behaved to get the most out this club  
P => Complete Reation    Its Now Beautful I just spent seven days at the Union League Club on a businesspleasure trip  As a member of a reciprocal club in Washington D C  I had heard that the Union League Club just completed a  million reation  Well Ill tell you they spent the money well  The place is now STUNNING The staff which was friendly professional and very helpful told me the sleeping rooms were completed gutted and rebuilt from scratch  All new plumbing HVAC furniture beds linens towels flat screen televisions ble bathrooms glass walk in showers plenty of electrical outlets for phones and computers and various other gadgets  Also has high speed wireless internet access which is free in their excellent Business Center My wife used the club as her home base while shopping and taking in the cultural offerings of Chicago its located in the heart of downtown while I attended meetings there during the day M F  The conference rooms were beautiful  and the food was outstanding  The wine list is very impressive The Union Leagues clubhouse offered us just about everything we could have wanted Its  stories tall has three restaurants two bars two floors of private meeting rooms eight floors of hotel rooms and suites a  volume library five floors of athletic facilities including an Olympic sized pool on its st floor  no small engineering feat that must have been two full time masseurs one full time masseuse a barber shop a full time manicurist my wife was pleased and shoe shine service I was pleased a stunning Members lounge any guest  use it and a duly famous art collection Im sure those who posted last year that it was getting tired and worn were right and the Union League must have heard them because now that its been reated the place is truly spectacular All the place lacks is stunning views but we were so busy with what was going on inside the clubhose that we didnt spend much time gazing out the windows Someone told me the Union League Club has been voted the   city club in the country  Its easy to see why  
P => Old World Class If you are looking for a charming old club look no further  Every floor was filled with world class art and the staff was polite friendly and helpful  Breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious  Free internet computer access in the library  A very relaxed and pleasant experience with excellent location close to the Chicago Board of Trade  Room was small but a good value for the money  Priced very reasonably for this location in the Loop  Highly recommended  
P => Hmmm   I was expecting more Ive stayed at better discount motels that are in better shape have a better atmosphere and are more updated I stayed here as a result of a conference that I was attending at the Union League Club  I figured for the convenience it was going to be worth it  Boy was I wrong  This building does have a lot of history and it shows  The conference areas are in great shape but it seems as if the hotel rooms are an afterthought if a thought at all  Too bad since with a facelift this could be a very special place The interior of my room was worn  The bed including blankets sheets and pillows looked old  I felt dirty sleeping at this facility  My closet door wouldnt shut  The bathroom was small with little to no counter space  The toilet was leaking and the wallpaper was peeling  The ceiling fan tried to work but just could never get going  The handle was loose on the exterior door to my room and looked to be in danger of falling off the door  My curtains did not close all of the way unless I held them in place with something heavy a Chicago phone book did the job  One of the windows looked directly into an office less than  away  The walls are paper thin with no sound insulation so your neighbors business is your business The location of this facility is the only thing that it has going for it  Right in the heart of downtown Chicago  You are walking distance from everything including a ride up to the top of the Sears tower  I will definitely return to Chicago for a longer visit in the future but the Union League Club will not be retaining my business  Please do yourself a favor and do not stay here since they force a pretentious atmosphere on you but dont back it up with clean and modern living arrangements  
P => Not impressed  tired and worn Tired and worn  We stayed   the Union League Club for the weekend in il   Not impressed in the least  The bed was horrendous  we did not get ANY sleep all weekend  The matress was shmellow soft  The pillows were nasty  Carpet and furnishing were worn  Tiny bathroom  LOUD heating system that will keep you up in the middle of the night  Would never join and would never stay there again  Did not like anything about it  
P => Over  years old and showing it The Union League Club of Chicago prides itself on tradition  I spent  days here while on business  This facility must have been grand in its day  Alas no longer  Its tired and dowdy and does not appear as elegant in true life as it does on the website It is clean and reasonably priced   daily  and is well located in Downtown Chicago close to The Mercantile Exchange and a short walk from the Art Institute and Millenium Park  Staff are polite but services are limited Jeans are not allowed Monday to Friday  While this is probably to maintain a sense of distinction and tradition I suggest a major makeover of this hotel would achieve the same but with more credability I would not choose this hotel on my next visit but it  be suitable if your budget is restricted

P => Reconsider I have traveled globally for Fortune  amp  companies and Westins tend to be safe and predictable  The Westin   Northwest Chicago has a very elegant look and feel  However on this occasion we found sheets with old blood stains which although laundered and likely clean you would think they would do more to eradicate the unsightliness  Add to this vacuum cleaners loud and constant from  to  a m  and you get the sense they are oblivious people are there to sleep  The final straw was a ridiculously priced menu with   service charge automatically added per persons meal aside from any tips and a room service breakfast complete with scrambled eggs that were more liquid than solid  In short noisy somewhat unclean and food that appeared unsafe for consumption   all at Westin pricing  It wouldnt have been bad if the front desk staff upon checkout inquired how your stay was rather they must assume all is well  I didnt bother to say anything as the staff seemed generally uninterested  Dont look for many amenities like free wi fi as this is a very a la carte hotel  
P => Designed for business travelers but nice all around I actually stayed here for business and then stayed an extra night for leisure  The rooms are geared more towards the professional with a kind of minimalist elegance  Almost a s or s style like you would see in the show Mad Men It is actually located in Itasca about a  minute drive into downtown but I highly recommend taking the train into town instead of driving  It only costs like  for a one way pass and on the weekends  gets you unlimited rides You save so much on parking and on your hotel room by taking the train into downtown  Plus they run as late as AM so you can still enjoy the nightlife  I actually got my shoes shined as well and it was done well for  or so  The only downside is that the bar etc close early  But you would probably be downtown anyway if you were planning on enjoying the nightlife  We happened to catch a free concert on Navy Pier the weather was beautiful the music free and fun it was a good time all around 
P => A good choice Driving to the hotel from OHare airport we thought it seemed in the middle of nowhere  However we discovered that it is near  large malls and many restaurants  Also many major highways are nearby making it very easy to get to other places in the suburbs  Check in was easy and friendly  Our room was on the top floor so we had no problem with noise from the atrium  There was good Starbucks coffee in the room  The bathroom was small the amenities sparse a little leaf soap never replenished which slipped thru the soap holder in the shower no shower caps etc  The towels were small less expensive chains have much better towels and give you more of them  Both at this Westin and the subsequent one we stayed in on Michigan Avenue skimped on towels  We always had to find the maid and ask for more  The pillows were very soft  There was a nice wide desk  The room was well designed with a place to put  suitcases  not always the case  in one hotel suite we had to put one suitcaes on the table  The elevators were very slow there were no papers on the weekends  At least we got on on our door during the week  We didnt downtown in spite of being platimim clients  even after asking  Some people have complained about there only being one restaurant but there is a breakfast bar with good bagels at a good price and there are  other fast food places down the corridor which had inexpensive quick food  The Sunday buffet at Ditkas was very reasonable  All in all it was a good place to stay  One caveat  there were a number of youth sports teams staying there so you might want to avoid their floors  
P => Nice property great bed free Starbucks My wife and I enjoyed staying at the Westin Chicago Northwest  We booked the room from Priceline for only   so we didnt know until confirmation where we were staying  Upon arrival it was clear that hotel was a tad better than Holiday Inn Motel  etc    there was a Ferrari parked near the entrance  It would have been quiet evening for the hotel but a high school prom was going on in the lobby  AND LOUD  Thank goodness you couldnt hear it much while inside the room with the air conditioning on  We were hoping to use the pool but that was closed at     Other than that the tv was nice in the room   quot Samsung HDTV and the bed was very nice   they call it quotHeavenly Bed quot They have complimentary Starbucks in all of the rooms and we definitely enjoyed a ent cup of coffee for change  We would definitely book again and check in earlier to use the pool  If you do use Priceline search for hotels in Itasca with  stars at     you will probably get the deal  
P => Beautiful Renation I stayed at the Westin while attending a business conference  I was absolutely amazed by the transformation of this hotel  The front desk was very flexible with my many room requests  My room was very comfortable as I have grown accustomed to with Starwood  The staff made me feel welcomed as if I was a guest in their home  Very impressed and will return next year 
P => AWESOME hotel I went in ch of  with a mutual friend of my gf and mine to visit her the mutual friends family  I booked on Hotwire and this is the one that they gave me  I was actually trying for a different one but BOY was I satisfied  My jaw actually dropped when I looked up in the lobby to see all of the rooms and hallways  Everything was clean and beautiful The beds were soft and shower had plenty of water pressure although it did take a little time to totally warm up but that could be because I was on the th floor and the toilet seat was the most comfortable one I have ever sat on I see the normal rate is over  per night I paid  through hotwire so it was an awesome deal But even the normal rate isnt that out of line for this place  The ONLY negative is the location  it takes over  minutes to get to downtown Chicago  Other than that I loved it 
P => Priceline Guest at the Westin I had a funeral to attend to in the area and was booked into the hotel by Priceline for night  Given the price I was paying I was satisfied with the hotel  Room was wonderful    spacious great TV tasteful modern furnishings nice robe in the closet  Two shower heads in shower  Soft towels  Internet access was pricey    I needed it and it cost me  for  accesses  Shulas steak house is very expensive as is the breakfast menu there  I dont think the round layout with an open central core was meant for a cold climate  Outside the room the coridors were always cold  The front desk clerks were shivering whenever I walked by  The lobby was too cold to loiter in  There are two choices for workout rooms  Top floor has cardio machines and is open  hours  In the basement is a full service spa with pool racquetball all possible machines and hours you would expect from a regular health club  Apparently they sell memberships to the locals Noise is a huge problem  The tent ballroom sends noise up to the entire side of the building The hotel was largely vacant during my stay except Saturday night when it was hopping but Sunday morning there were as usual almost no cars in the parking lot  I suspect the hotel is losing some big  and that is why they are filling rooms with us Priceline customers The hotel is right off the Eisenhower Expressway so it is possible to get to many places easily  Not the hotels fault but what is with the  MPH speed limit in Illinois Didnt anybody tell them that Nixons speed limit died with himI have no idea what is in the Itasca area that could justify such a pricey hotel  I would never pay the rack rate here A Satisfied Priceline guest 
P => Clean crisp and a bit out of the city We took a girls weekend up to Chicago for some shopping  Since we planned to spend an ample amount of time at Woodfield Mall and IKEA we opted to stay in the quotburbs quot Our arrival and checkin was a breeze  Our room was very crisp and clean  White comforters is appealing and relieving  Starbucks coffee and TAZO tea are both in the room  We called the front desk for  extra robes and within minutes literally they were at our door  That evening we asked as we walked in from dinner close to midnight for some extra bags of af and they actually said quotstay right herequot They ran off to somewhere and came back with  bags for us  They were above and beyond on customer service  I ran the next morning on the trail behind the hotel  Its a paved trail that loops around   manmade lakes each one boasting a fountain and birds geese ducks etc    I was planning to run  miles but after  loops was a bit bored as its only about a  mile loop  This hotel is literally about  miles from Woodfield Mall and there are SEVERAL eateries in the area as well  Its a great option for a business trip family vacation out of the city no parking or valet costs or just a quick trip quotaway quot 
P => The Noise In This Hotel is Horrible First I want to say the hotel staff were all unfailingly polite and helpful  Couldnt ask for better  But the design of the property leads to incredible noise echoing around the atrium into the rooms  When the bar is full with its open top the noise is over the top  Then there is The Tent  This is literally a tent like structure in back of the hotel about  yards out  Be sure to check on weekends to see if there is going to be any kind of wedding or other event with loud music until late at night  Because if there is you wont be getting any sleep until very late at night  if your room is on that side of the building  We were on the th floor right over The Tent  The music was so loud that my dhter sang along with the songs and told me their names  When she was looking out about pm she put her hand on the window and told me it was vibrating from the bass and volume  When I went down and complained they gave my  off my rate but that doesnt help when you need sleep  On top of that the noise level didnt go down one bit  Every night we stuffed the  inch opening at the bottom of the room door to muffle noise  Here are a couple of other quirks that dont help  The smoke alarms have a very bright flashing green light that lights up the room like a strobe light  The beautiful flat screen TV also has a bright orange light that flashes all night up the wall  The alarm clock beams across the room like a search light too  
P => Above Average Business Hotel Ive stayed here on two arate occasions within the last  months at this property that was remodeled in the Spring of   Located in a business Park setting it has easy access to highways but no retail within walking distance  There is free and ample parking  Unique to this property is A   mile paved jogging path outdoor basketball and tennis courts in good condition  and a Reebok fitness room located on the top floor which had multiple pieces of equipment and panoramic windows a really thoughtful design thats a whole lot better than staring at a wall Common areas were well maintained and the staff courteous  I did not use the restaurants or lounge  The Standard King Room and the King ior Suite Platinum Upgrade had a contemporary design were quiet clean and the beds extremely comfortable  Bathrooms were a good size and well lit  Amenities included a flat panel TV a robe in room Starbucks coffee internet for a fee and I think the rooms had safes  This hotel charges a  facility fee  Not sure what that fee is for or if its a per day or a per stay charge both of my stays were for one night only  This is a great business trip hotel  You could bring the family along but they  get bored after the first night  ttz 
P => Spacious rooms good restaurant I stay here for business   there isnt much else of interest in the area as it is some way out of downtown Chicago  Though they do run a shuttle to Itasca station  There is also a major shopping mall nearby  It is always quite busy as it seems popular for local business conventions  The hotel has been remodelled it was the Wyndham and is clean bright modern and spacious from both the atrium to the rooms The staff are friendly and service is attentive in both the bar and the in hotel Shulas Steak Restaurant If you like meat   this is a good place to stay  Room service is from Shulas too   so is excellent One tip   the City cabs at OHare dont know where Itasca is and charge a supplement  Ask the hotel for details of local cab companies   I use All Star  
P => Business trip I spent  nights here on business  Check in was quick and friendly as was check out  The room was quite large  It had an adquate work area with internet access  The king bed and bedding were very comfortable  A side chair was actually comfortable enough to spend some relaxation time reading the paper  The shower had a dual shower head which seemed to me to be more of a gimmick than a quotmust havequot fixture  Everything was clean although room service seemed to have overlooked my room one day they came when notified that evening  My week was spent in the conference rooms and meal service was provided by the hotel  If room service is equivalent most of the food is acceptable not delicious but no major complaints either  The service was quite good with an attentive staff   There is a very nice gym on the top floor with a good variety of new cardio and strength equipment  The pool appeared to be clean and well kept though I didnt spend time in the water  There are plenty of services available with a variety of businesses located in the walkway that connects the property to the adjoining office building  They include things that arent necessarily there for the hotel guests such as a dentist and investment advisor but there are some that could be handy a copy center hair stylist flower shop Japanese restaurant to name a few  Shulas Steakhouse is located in the property  Based on my experience if youre in the area for business Id recommend this as a good spot to stay for a while  
P => Fiasco   Conference Coordinator Ive held two conferences at this hotel this year  The last one was planned for over a month  Within minutes of signing the contract and confirming that the block of rooms were being held the rooms were reserved by other guests  No one in our conference could get a reservation Everyone had to stay at the Hilton Forest Lakes a very nice hotel alternative and get transported between hotels  The Westinthreatened to charge us the full cancellation fee if we moved the conference to another facility Despite their apologies and written agreement the Westin shuttle was unavailable most of the time and completely forgot to pick us up on the last day  We ended up taking taxis at our own expense  While the rooms are nice I will never use them for a meeting again  
P => Great hotel     huge rooms We had our wedding at the Westin on ober  and have nothing but positive comments about this hotel Everything went smoothly and the staff from the banquet people to the front desk were courteous polite and accommodating every step of the way The rooms are modern and spacious the beds are comfortable and the property is very clean  The hotel changed hands from a Wyndham about six months ago and its evident that its a huge improvement  I highly recommend this hotel for a wedding business trip or weekend getaway  
P => So Comfortable Ahhhhhhh I walked into the lobby and was instantly impressed  The check in on a Fri  evening took  min  Then right up the glassed elevators to my room on the th floor  The room is so relaxing Nice big cushy bed lots of pillows  Pretty asian art on the walls  Streamlined flat screen TV  Very modern or  Also had internet and MP connections  View was of the interstate but what was cool was right down the road is OHare  So I stood at the window and ironed my clothes watching planes landing one after the other  Really entertaining           I thought anyway The bathrooms are smallish but very clean  A small dressing area is right near the bathroom  Lots of mirrors  If you leave your room looking bad its your fault Back in the lobby you have a gift shop Shulas coffee shop lounge and public areas  All very calming  The whole hotel takes on this serene atmosphere  Ventured over to the Reebok Workout Room  Clean and modern  With a killer view of the city and lovely grounds of the Westin  Also well equiped with TV stereo ectThis hotel is excellent for business or pleasure  The whole Westin experience will leave you very happy 
P => Very nice hotel Stayed here on a weekend Fri Sun prepaid rate  I had prepaid for a Thurs Sun stay buy  nights get third free and so when I was delayed by a day did not expect any discount  Asked for an upgraded room when I arrived and was given an enormous and very comfortable suite Very clean everything worked except for the in room safe  The traffic situation to Chicago during the weekend is not too bad  I made the trip in about  min  Although the atrium is loud because of the design just a few people talking in the lobby at normal voices sets off a cacophonous echoing I did not hear anything from the bedroom of my suite and slept extremely well  I dont think this property has any doormen   never saw or needed any  But the front desk people were very helpful and friendly  
P => Awfully nice Overall a terrific place to stay  The quotHeavenly Bedquot is truly heavenly  The rooms are immaculate very modern and have all the conveniences you would expect from a top of the line hotel  I had a terrific view of the distant Chicago skyline from my window  The hotel is on a several acre man made lake with a nice foot path that made me wish I had packed my rollerblades  Service was very good food exceptional and prices fair  Its close to OHare but a cab to downtown was over   The hotel has a shuttle that drops you off at the Itasca train station  Riding the Metra to Union Station is a better deal at   one way and is nearly as fast On the con side guests are assessed an extra fee to use the attached athletic clubs workout facility treadmillbikerowing machine weights raquetball basketball  Fortunately the pool hot tub and the attached locker room facilities including sauna and steam room are included without additional charge  
P => Good hotel with large rooms but can it really be called a Westin Sumy Huge lobby with an open atrium similar to Embassy Suites  Rooms are good sized and nicely furnished but does not have the luxurious feel of a Westin  ent but not great value given its remote suburb location Pros Lobby is huge with an open atrium and features restaurants and bars  Rooms are large and nicely furnished with flat screen LCD TV  There is even a arately table across the closet for luggage  Westin and Sheraton always have nice beds  You can also break Starbucks coffee in your own room  The pool is good size though not large  The workout room has lots of equipment in an area the size of a basketball court but not on the th floor as noted in a previous review and has no view  There is also an actual basketball court  The hotel seems is basically very large and should be good for business conferences Cons While the furnishings are nice they are not luxurious  The colors are very standard grey black and white monotone  The Itasca location is around   minutes from the OHare airport  If you take a taxi it is considered a suburb of Chicago so your fare will be   times the actual metered rate  Going into Chicago by car is not recommended due to traffic  Even though its very close to a highway intersection there is nothing around the hotel in terms of dining and shopping within the immediate area  Service attitude was a bit cool and there is no bell service at least for us  We moved all of our luggage including boxes by ourselves Conclusion I suppose I expect a bit more from the Westin in terms of quality  The facilities are great particularly for business conferences  I see no reason to stay there if you are a tourist since its too far away to be convenient  Price paid   tax for weekday 
P => Amazzzzzzzzing Great hotel and staff  This is a must see in the burbs  Hotel very modern and the best staff in Chicago  Great deal and outstanding value  Priced rightThe lobby bar was an exciting place to meet with a extensive wine list available by the glass Associates are all very excited about what they do  Close to Ohare and Wood field  Heavenly bed and shower a must for every home  I can not wait to return  
P =>  Heavenly  I had the pleasure of staying at this property for the Illinois Assoc  for College Admission Counseling      I had read earlier reviews that were unfavorable but after hearing that the hotel was taken over by Westin and refurbished I was excited I was not disappointed and the hotel exceeded my expectations    exceeded them so much that I will most likely choose this hotel when I am on business again in this area and leaving the hotel I usually have stayed at over the last  yearsThe rooms are spacious  The provided bathrobe was a nice luxourious touch and I appreciated the in room Starbucks coffee  The tileble bath with double headed shower was a nice respite at the end of my busy conference days and I found myself going to bed early just so I could get more time in the bed   the bed mattress and linens was like sleeping in a cloud  I wish I could take it home with me  The LCD tv was great too and the honor bar while expensive   had a good variety and was well stocked  The work area with internet access must pay for it was spacious as well and the chair was comfortable  Room servince food was a bit pricey but the portions were extremely large and quality was wonderful  Maid servicecleanliness   imacculate Hotel staff was great at front desk and with a couple of requestneeds I had The workout room was great   good exquipment and great views of the area on th floor  Pool was a bit small but nice If you are planning a conference a weekend in the Woodfield area or just need to spend a few nights on business   this is a great place  After busy working days its so nice to come quothomequot to a hotel room that is relaxing  I will definitely be back 
P => great for business I was a little hesitant to book this hotel after reading the reviews but ided to go for it anyways  It turns out the hotel was reated and reopened only about  months ago making it very clean and comfortable  The room was spacious well appointed and the Heavenly Bed and Bath were relaxing and wonderful as always  I liked the arate vanity area near the bathroom as well as the LCD TV and Aeron like desk chair  The shuttle service was very accommodating drivingpicking me up from Schaumburg multiple times  It was great for business and it seems convenient for the nearby Woodfield Mall as well  Now that Im home I miss the Heavenly Bed 
P => Love the bartenders I stayed at the Wyndham this past Friday and sat nightthe hotel was very nice the rooms were very clean and the bed was great The only problem I had was with the restaurant Shulas like one of the other reviews the bar no name lounge on Friday the bartender a girl it must of been her first night working because she did not know how to make any drinks that I wanted and when I wanted to dine in there she gave me a dirty look  I ended up down at the Atruim bar and grillunder the big tent that was great the people bartenders Rich and Dennis made our weekend they both told the best storys and had us lhing the whole time we were there  We will go back just to see them if our travels get us to the Chicagoland area  
P => Elegant But Dont Depend on Staff or Shuttle Stayed at the Wyndham the weekend of ch    Very pretty hotel nice room but relative with bad back preferred the pillow top bed at nearby riott in Schaumburg in Spring   Three challenges  Brides beware many relatives were VERY distressed Saturday night at nearby wedding reception on learning that the promised Wyndham shuttle wasnt coming back  The shuttle had been a deal maker for the brides family Unbelievably management at the reception said Wyndham had disappointed reception guests at other events in recent past by shutting down shuttle prior to contracted for pick up times   Wyndham rented out the lobby one evening and took out all the sofas and chairs    oddly leaving no room to sit and visit with friends in the lobby   Staff at desk and at Sunday brunch were super But many other hotel staff need training on attitude improvement amp attention to guests since they range from cool to outright uncaring  Example A When making calls to verify previously made reservations various staff treat it like a joke when they have difficulty accessing records and keeping names straight  Example B Staffer at coffee bar Sunday morning not free was too involved with own tasks to pay attention for several minutes to customer  Had to be asked for coffee then for napkin spoon sugar    and acted put out to boot  Example C Almost all bell hops were courteous amp pleasant except for young man at bell hop desk on Sunday afternoon who loudly bragged to a colleague quotI aint working like a pig quot 
P => Nice hotel watch out for extras This is a nice Wyndham in a suburb of Chicago not to be confused with the Wyndham Chicago in downtown which is a beautiful hotel  Check in was nice  I paid only  through Priceline so it was a great deal  By Request perks are not available with Priceline though The room is large nicely appointed but not luxurious  Beds were nice they pay a lot of attention to the linens they use so the beds look nice as well  Theres a good sized work desk with a fancy Aeron chair and a sitting area with a couch  The bathroom was standard High speed internet wireless or wired is  per calendar day NOT per  hour period  This is annoying because if you check in at pm and pay  to use high speed internet your connection will expire at midnight and then youll have to pay another  to continue using it  However if you wait until pm theyll give you that  hour period as a courtesy and your  will give you until midnight the following night  Internet is free with By Request Also there is a  fee to use the exercise facility because its a privately owned gym  Its a ent gym with racquetball courts weight machines cardio machines  It is about  miles from the airport and probably  minutes from downtown but if you have business in the area its a nice pick especially if you get a good rate on Priceline  
P => good value with web rate I spent the last weekend    at the Wyndham attending a conference  I checked the web rate night which was cheaper than my special conference rate and included one free breakfast  The hotel is not really near the airport or the city but set in an office park on a lake with a fountain  The setting is very nice  As suggested by another reviewer I used the My Chauffeur service and it was excellent call the hotel directly and ask for My chauffeur My room was comfortable and large with all the necessary ammenities  I would disagree about the bed however  I am a chiropractor and found the bed to be unsupportive  Yes it looks nice but too pillowy soft I dont think dining was a problem as others have said  However the room service menu says quotall day diningquot but only from  pm on how is that all dayAll in all a pleasant stay at a great price  
P => Wonderful Wyndham Weekend I spend about  nights per year in a hotel and have stayed in hotels in  states and Canada I was the Keynote Speaker for the PSO conference this past weekend and was booked into this hotel The room was wonderful I was booked into a corner room on the th floor which met my stipulations QUIET clean and comfortable    not to mention the wonderful bed The view was a treat The entire staff at the hotel were very kind   especially the bellman named Steve who did his best to accomodate my requestsThe only negative comment was my meal at the in house restaurant named Shulars   There are  choices for dining in the hotel a sandwich casual cafe and Shulars which is one of the top  steak houses and the hostess wore the attitude all over herself  I came in on Friday night after speaking in Louisville and flying to OHare  I was tired and hungry  It was next to impossible to get her to seat me  Apparently I did not fit a certain mold even though I was dressed professionally and clean I was persistent and finally a host came in to find me a table  There were at least a dozen empty tables but she told mequot we are short of wait staff and it will be a   minute waitquot  I did finally eat there and my bill was   A disappointment at best  My servers were kind and thorough but my initial experience really foreshadowed the meal Also take the quotmy chauffeurquot from the airport   it is  for shared ride in a clean comfortable limo and very well worth it  I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
P => Most Comfortable Bed Ever I have stayed here two or three times for conferences and also because my wifes family lives just a few miles away I must say that this hotel is one of our favorites It has probably the most confortable beds of any hotel we have ever visited before  The rooms are very spacious and tastfully orated in soft colors  Comforters are unbelievably warm and inviting Hotel staff can be a bit rude at times but at other times very helpful  Breakfast buffet is over priced and definitely not worth it I agree with the lady on here who said that the banquet lunch was excellent  
P => Babquet dinner I was at the Windham Hotel  Park Blvd Itasca Il on  for a Banquet dinner for Elmhurst Hospital  I want the hotel  chef and the staff to know that the meal that was seved was the best I have ever had at a banquet  Everyone seated at my table said the same thing  The service was excellent  Please let the chef and the staff know they did an excellent job      ilyn 
P => 
P => Do not give them your credit card Only can get a live person on the phone from   central time  Call and see Unreasonable cancellation policy  Ask for it in writing Multiple billing errors  Billed in  and  for a stay that never happened  Just reported them to American Express for the latest issue  
P => Short Visit for U This was a great little hotel for access to Soldier Field and the museums  It is a relatively short walk to them and to Grant Park  The service was good and the rooms large  It is an old mansion that could use a little updating  We had a king suite in the front of the house  For the size of the room the location and the city of Chicago the charges were appropriate  I was concerned about walking to Soldier Field and back at night but those worries were dispelled when limos and taxi were dropping off concert goers in front of our hotel and there was a strong police presence  Obviously i felt safe that night  There was a solid breakfast in the morning  All in all it was a nice and comfortable place in a great location for the concert and at a ent price  
P => Great for conferences at McCormick Place I was hesitant staying here because of the previous reviews  But I was pleasantly surprised  The staff were very nice helpful and accommodating  The breakfast was nothing special but I wasnt staying there for breakfast  The rooms were clean and comfortable  I would gladly return  
P => Peaceful charming and impeccable service I loved this place  It is genuinely boutique in the level of service and the lack of the homogenised feel and lack of trust in guests which so many of the hotel chains have which is necessary no doubt   sadlyMy room was large and furnished with exquisite antiques  The shower was wonderful  The breakfasts were delightful though one thought I did have was that it would be nice to have hot water and coffee throughout the day rather than just in the morning  The large relaxing living room is equipped with maps of Chicago and fascinating books about the city The location is extremely convenient if one is attending a conference at the nearby Hyatt McCormick place which I was I have to make special mention of the manager Lukas whose laid back intelligent helpfulness really stood out e g  letting me use internet in his office arranging for me to stay another night with no fuss whatsoever Highly recommended for those happy to trade superficial glitz advertising rewards points etc etc for some old world character Cathy Legg 
P => Wheeler mansion is a great find Just stayed there on   on business  Was pleasantly surprised  Great way to escape the commercial side of hotels it is a boutique so it is kind of basic nice hot breakfast clean modern bathrooms elegantly furnished  I did need the fax which the manager allowed me to use without any issues  Free of charge  When is the last time you got something free at a hotel      
P => Suited Us Look at the photos with this review for a sense of the area and the Wheeler Mansion itself  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Wheeler Mansion  Little problems were ironed out by the staff  For example it was cold at first but they gave us an extra heater and we had a gas fireplace  Cassandra was completely helpful  Chris while a little rough around the edges made every attempt to make our stay a pleasant one We liked the area  Daily we walked to the downtown and back several times in the dark and never once felt unsafe  The area is largely yuppie condostownhouses to the north and the convention center to the south  In the day the lakefront walk is a beautiful route  If you dont want to walk the three miles to get to the center of town a taxi will cost you about   tip  A bus will cost  Nearby restaurants include these excellent ones    Chicago Firehouse Gioco and Ma amp I  each a    min  walk  Wed like to go back  
P => Dont stay here on business I agree with quotWheeler Mansion   Bad customer servicequot  The quotgeneral managerquot that showed me around when I checked in talked a good game offering all sorts of concierge services which I never used but when it came time to pay for my stay I was given the same line about being liable for   of my reservation even though I had to check out a day early  When I expressed my displeasure and tried to explain that their policy didnt make any sense given that their proximity to McCormick place means that a lot of their customers will be business travelers and that business travelers plans change frequently the quotgeneral managerquot tried to pass the buck to the owners and just flatly stated that I should have known the policy when I made the reservation  Basically I left feeling that I got screwed which is a shame The property itself is very nice but its in an absolutely deserted part of town  Its that part of town thats either quotup and comingquot or quotthe wrong side of the tracksquot depending probably on your political persuasion  While the hotel is only two blocks from McCormick place I would definitely not recommend that a woman walk alone around the neighborhood at night  The propertys immediate neighbors are a parking garagelot a warehouse under construction being converted into condos a humongous postwar factory thats showing its age and a bunch of other buildings that would be a great place to host a rave All in all its a shame that the customer service was so bad because it has the potential despite its surroundings to be a good overflow option for the McCormick place hotels when they book up  However I wouldnt recommend staying at the Wheeler Mansion if youre going to a conference Another strange facet of the property is that the quotgeneral managerquot is only on the property intermittently and only during business hours  If you need something at night youre completely on your own  No receptionist no quotfront deskquot no nothing  
P => Was good but now is BAD Horrible customer service The History In the defense of this wheeler mansion hotel I have had good experiences here before in   I booked  rooms that year for a sales staff meeting and the manager Gary took fine care of us  Even the manager that was there before Gary his name was Michael was an excellent person and very prompt and professional The Bad The current manager Chris is not a person that should be in the hospitality business and will run that place into the ground  He is rude on the phone rude in person and is more of a bouncer than a hotel manager I am truly sad to say I will never use this hotel again even though I have had great experiences there in the past The Good What I can say good is Casandra the head of housekeeping is very nice  The neighborhood is moderatly safe during the day and it is close to McCormick place  Overall it is not worth the price and you can book a much better hotel in a better place  
P => Worst Place Ive ever stayed TERRIBLE  We stayed there based on some good reviews weve read but after our experience the only thing that makes sense is that the managment are the ones writing their own good reviews  It is the worst service we have ever experienced Please dont stay there  The owner quotDeboraquot is very rude and inflexible and our breakfast was late and cold  Undercooked waffles with old fruit  
P => Beyond our expectations    My husband and I frequently visit Bed and Breakfasts throughout the country and The Wheeler Mansion has taken our   recommendation  From the moment we contacted the property to book a reservation we had an excellent experience  The gal we had booked through was incredibly friendly and also helpful in deed  The hosts Sara and Gary were fabulous  Throughout our  day stay they held many delightful conversations and also provided us with excellent recommendations for area attractions and dining  The property is beautiful  We were given a tour of each of the rooms and suites and they are all unique  Ive already chosen the room we will stay in when we return 
P => Youre darn right  star  Ive read the positive reviews that rave about the area that this hotel is in    I just dont get it The south loop is partially residential and partially government housing  I did not feel safe walking around at night and in fact saw a car in the alley with a broken window  It is close to McCormick Place and I was able to walk to work but I never left the hotel after the sun went down  There wasnt much to do on my day off   Prairie Avenue is not as gentrified as you might read  Id recommend staying near mass transit where there are people around  I really liked River North and Old Town 
P => A Bates Motel Clone During the hotest weekend in Chicago the ac was broken prior to our check in  The staff failed to inform us at check in and after trying for an hour to adjust the temperature we were finally told that the ac had been off for most of the day  The staff leaves after pm  We left our room when the thermoste in our room hit  degress and sought refuge at another property  The hotels management was indignet that we complained  Despite its historic charm the accommodations are far below what would be expected for almost  per day  
P => Horrible Customer Service   stay away The Wheeler Mansion is a fantastic building with great rooms  Unfortunately it has by the the worst staff that I have ever dealt with  It is extremely difficult to get a hold of anyone and when we did they were rude and condescending  Rather than hear any issues which we had they were defensive and only argued  This is not the way a customer service oriented business should work  There are a plethora of other places in the city which can provide you with a romantic and pampered experience for the same price  
P => Visiting McCormick Place Wheeler is not as convenient as it seems  Wheeler Mansion is close to McCormick Place and that works very much in its favor  Otherwise however the neighborhood is empty it is all residential with very little activity and is not as convenient to tourism as the website implies  The building is beautiful and very nicely furnished but not built or managed to be a hotel  The very limited staff are hard working and friendly but just are not sufficient for the needs of this type of business  
P => Enjoyed my stay The Wheeler Mansion is a beautiful hotel and the staff was very friendly and helpful  The owner is a very nice woman  The rooms were well appointed and comfortable  Recommended 
P => What a gem The Wheeler Mansion is every bit as lovely as small elegant five star hotels across Europe and so much more intimate and beautiful than high end hotels in the city that cost easily twice as much  The restoration of this about to be demolished mansion spared no expense and the proof is in the details  An easy walk to McCormick Place the Prairie Preservation district the museum campus and wonderful restaurants  Theres free parking right on the property so you can drive to Millennium Park Michigan Avenue and the Loop in five minutes  
P => Quiet special spot in the heart of Chicago My wife and I spent a weekend at the Wheeler Mansion  We arrived late  PM because of some airline delays and had no problems getting into our room  The owners live on the property and are available during off hours  The staff is highly attentive and very friendly  All I can gather from previous negative reviews is that the owners were have some problems hiring the right kind of people  The good news is that they have them now The Mansion is unique and tastefully luxurious  Each room is furnished with a mix period appropriate antiques and modern amenities  There is a large dining room and beautiful comfortable sitting room It is a perfect alternative to the sterile one size fits all hotel room for the McCormick Place conventioneer  It is the perfect hidden pleasure for those looking for a quiet weekend getaway  Were already planning our return After only one visit it has become our favorite place to stay in Chicago  We are already planning 
P => Romance in the middle of the city My husband and I stayed here on a whim for Valentines Day and all I can say is ROMANCE magnifyed  The reservationist assured me a spectacular evening   I requested champagne in the room  When I arrived there was champagne perfectly chilled on a silver platter scattered with red rose petals  glasses each with a strawberry on the rim chocolate covered strawberriesthe biggest I have ever seen on the bed with a romantic love quote on each pillow  The lights were soft and a Frank Sinatra CD was playing in the cd player  WOW In the morning breakfast was spectacular and we could sit by the fire in the living room drinking coffee and reading the paper  No rush to check out  If you are looking for the perfect quiet getaway this is it 
P => Best place in Chicago I recently stayed a weekend at the Wheeler Mansion and had the most wonderful magical experience Every last detail of my stay was perfect right down to the chocolate on my pillow at night  The front desk people were very helpful and knowledgable about area restaurants and places of interest  They were always making sure my needs were met and ready to help me at the drop of a hat  The building is also beautifully furnished and orated for the holiday season  It was a real treat to be able to stay at the Wheeler Mansion  I will be returning for sure 
P => 
P => Great location Stayed hear because we wanted to go to the Kingston Mines and a few other Blues bars in that area  Very nice area to walk around and feal safe late at night  Lincoln park Zoo is about a mile walking distance from the hotel and there is plenty of places to eat  The front desk when we arrived was very helpful and pleasant  He gave us great advice about the places we were inquiring about  eatingmusicsightseeing  The room was pretty good as we had the King ior suite Bathrooms are very small not much room around the sink to place anything  Beds Are very very comfortable  Walls are very thin you can hear everything as we were next to the staircase and could hear everyone going up and down the stairs  If you stay hear I would not recommend staying on the West side of the Hotel there are trucks loading in the Alley beside you at A M and they are there for most of the morning but there is an alley on the East side to but it is a through lane so it might not be so bad  Internet was free and worked very well  Continental breakfast was excellent and free parking was behind the building and looked pretty safe  Staff could not have been any nicer  No hairdryer or microwave TVs work great  Elevator is small and hallways have a funny smell  But overall I would stay here again and would recommend it as long as you know this is what this hotel offers  
P => Comfortable reasonably priced and in a great neighborhood We just returned from a three night stay at The Willows Hotel and found it to be very pleasant  Its clean the staff is thoughtful and the Lakeview East neighborhood is a joy and easy base for a stay in Chicago  We had an executive king room and my only complaint about our room is its loud air conditioner  It kept me awake for much of the first night  We later ran it only during the daytime when we were gone  When we returned we turned off the air conditioner and turned on the big overhead fan  That worked well but the weather was cooler than normal during our stay in Chicago  I dont know if that method would work in a heat wave  Nonetheless wed stay here again  
P => A real gem Wonderful hotel in a great part of Chicago   very quiet street and a short walk from some great bars and restaurants and it is only a  minute drive to downdown Chicago  The restuarants are also much better value in this neighbourhood than downtown  The staff were wonderul and always willing to help  The rooms of very high standard and extremely comfortable  They do a very simple buffet breakfast   nothing special but was included in the price  You can take your breakfast up to your room   which is quite helpful as the space and seating in reception is not really geared up for eating breakfast  They also have tea and coffee on tap   This is a great hotel and really is home from home  I will certainly stay here again  
P => Clean quiet place This is a very clean and comfortable hotel  OUr room smelled like fresh laundry Beds were comfy and linens were luxurious  Lobby is very relaxing and well kept  Breakfast was more than satisfactory hotel personnel were very friendly  It is in Lakeview  Lincoln Park area away from hustle and bustle of downtown    I loved the location and there are plenty of places to shop and eat right in the neighborhood  I will stay here again   
P => 
P => Review    Hotel itself was nice  Concierge was great as well as the staff in the barrestaurant  The staff at the front desk were horrible We waited   hours passed our check in time and finally I went up there for the third time and they had a room ready for us  Hotel was beautiful rooms were nothing special hotel was close to everything   including the hospital across the street that has ambulances with sirens leaving and arriving all times of the night Ugh  
P => Great location great weekend rates Impressive well maintained  Room was large with desk and armoiretv  Staff is very helpful and friendly  The front desk in a word reserved  There are several breakfast stops within  to  block walking distance Corner Bakery West Egg Cafe and Einstein Bros  Bagels  Corner Bakery is across the street and opens at AM for the first coffee of the day  Great baked goods  
P => Great location comfy beds great deal My mom and I stayed at the Wyndham for  nights and had a very pleasant stay  The beds are very comfortable  The location is great if you want to be near the Magnificent Mile  One thing to note is that the room photos included in the Trip Advisor hotel profile are not of a standard size room  We had a standard room with two queen beds and it was much smaller than the room shown in the photos  For two people it was fine but if you re a family with kids it would be pretty cramped  One minor quirk about how the hotel is laid out that might be problematic if you have mobility problems is that you need to take two different elevators to get to the guest rooms  Customer service at this hotel is great  The concierge was really helpful with dinner reservations and directions  As far as price goes we got a great deal that I couldn t have been more pleased with  Overall we had a great experience at the Wyndham and I would not hesitate to stay here again if I needed to be in this neighborhood again  
P => Great Price and Location I booked the Wyndham for the weekend of  thru  on Expedia for   nonrefundable per night and the hotels website was charging   nonrefundable per night so I got a great deal and was very happy about that  Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and more than willing to help  At the check in desk the clerk told me I could upgrade to a suite for   per night so I did  The room was adequate the furniture to me is a little out dated  The TV could also use an upgrade to a flat screen  Oh    And valet parking is   per night so be prepared to pay  Luckily we found street parking and left the car there the entire weekend  Other than that minor complaint the location was great again the staff was very friendly and the bed was super comfortable  I definitely recommend this hotel 
P => Good location   good rate   well appointed The hotel is in an excellent location with friendly helpful staff espec concierge and well appointed and well maintained rooms  The beds and bed linen were especially comfortable and clean  Having to pay for wireless internet in the room was a little galling but on a rate of UK  per night one cant complain  Excellent inexpensive breakfast to be had just across the street at the Corner Bakery   the cognoscenti of Chicago were inside enjoying Anaheim scramblers and everlasting coffee Recommend both hotel and the Bakery   
P => Good location and clean   but it ends at that If you are a business traveler and NOT a light sleeper this is the perfect hotel for you  Great location in Streeterville neighborhood with all of the tourist attractions within walking distance  If you are a leisure traveler there are many more interesting options just across Mag mile in River North Yes the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable and I dont typically write negative reviews but there were just too many little details that would cause me to recommend other options to first time visitors to Chicago  And for a four diamond rating I would expect more Check in went like this quotName please   can you spell that   I need a photo ID   your room is on the th floor   elevators are down the hallway on the left quot There was no quotwelcomequot or quotthank youquot or quotI hope you enjoy your stay quotAgain the room and bath were clean spacious and comfortable   but basic  The mirror above the vanity was not large enough to span the space and did not align with the positioning of the bathroom sink   thus you had to step to the right to see yourself The hotel is adjacent to Northwestern Memorial Hospital so you will hear the sirens from ambulances from time to time through the night The doors slammed shut and the walls I thought were quite thin So again there are so many other unique options with a little research a leisure traveler can find something more memorable and relaxing  
P => Great Surprise We booked this hotel as part of a Hotel Special hoping for the best  When we arrived we were thrilled to find a centrally located and glamourous hotel  The fixtures and rooms are lovely  Staff are friendly and did their utmost to make our stay  Shopping is on your doorstep as are some great resturants  We went to a Brazilian resturant and rate it as the best meal of the  week stay  
P => Great locatio ideal for a tourist Perfect location to see everthing in Chicago  We used to Mero and walked to get around and had no issues Hotel is clean and staff helpful  We didnt eat in the hotel as Chicago has far too many great restauranrts to miss Love Chicago and thought this hotel was a great base and worth the money Their is a very small pool a bit disapointing  The jacuzzi and steam and sauna made uo for it as this helps ease the feet after a long day sight seeing We did not hear any noise and had great sleeps in a really comfy bed  
P => wonderful customer service We had a block of rooms at the Wyndham for our wedding  All of the Wyndham employees we dealt with were extremely accommodating helpful friendly kind and professional  The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location in Chicago  Affordable and chic  
P => worth every penny We read the reviews before booking however based on location we booked here regardless of the negatives cost of parking noise from the hospital etc   We were so glad we did  The location was great   easy walk to Michigan Ave the Magnificent Mile Navy Pier etc  A great breakfast restaurant right across the street and TGIFridays close for lunch also an easy walk to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner  We had a blast in Chicago The   spent on parking at this hotel was worth every penny as we never saw our car for  hours  Make sure to take in the boat tour of the City at pm  
P => Its just average  I think the price is not cheap  The hotel doesnt have pick up serice amp no free Internet  Its   per day for Internet access  I didnt wanna pay for it since I only need to use the Internet for like   hours per day just to check email  
P => Great Location   Could Use Some Updating We stayed there for  nights over the Labor Day weekend  Booked an executive suite online at wyndham com  Rate was not cheap but we wanted more space than a normal city hotel  The room was very large although the there was not enough furniture for the size of the room  The room furniture and TV was quite outdated for the price of the hotel  The best feature of this hotel is the great location just one block from Michigan Avenue  Overall this is a basic hotel   clean and safe  The staff could have been friendlier and more welcoming   but that is usual in a big city hotel I would recommend parking at one of the nearby lots at Northwestern Hospital as the valet parking is night and takes about   minutes to retrieve your car  
P => Will Stay Again Awesome hotel  Convenient to Michigan Ave  and bus routes to all museums  Conceirge Russell is top notch always helpful with a travel tip on saving time andor money  Rooms are big and beds are nice especially after a long day in Chicago  Will Stay there again when in Chicago 
P => Great location and good service Cant beat the location  Easy to walk just about anywhere on Michigan Ave Gold Coast Millenium Park  Great TravelZoo rate included breakfast  Parking a bit expensive at  a night  Cheaper parking within walking distance to hotel  Friendly staff  Got the runaround a bit when trying to connect to internet  As a Wyndham Rewards member internet should be free  Hotel blamed internet provider internet provider blamed Wyndham  After  minutes problem solved  
P => Cannot fault this hotel  Having read some of the other reviews on this site I am quite surprised with some of the negative comments  My girlfriend and I stayed for  nights then stayed for a extra  for my birthday  The service from all of the hotel staff was Excellent  I have to say that words cannot describe how good the concierge are especially Kaitlyn if there was an award for best concierge she should win it  We had two different rooms during our stay upgraded to a suite for my birthday  Ok they dont have flat screen tvs but have very comfortable beds and the suite had more room  Both rooms where immaculate We had lunch most days in the restaurant and the time we stayed they had a lunch special for  of which included a main and soft drink  The service in the restaurant is first class especially from Joel could not do enough for us Please dont be put off staying here by the other reviews our experience I would recommend to anyone  Thanks Wyndham Chicago for a great stay  
P => Unrekable I was wondering how I felt about this hotel and I ided that I didnt feel much of anything  Sometimes when I travel there is something about a hotel or inn that impresses me  This hotel didnt impress me much  Before this gets to sounding too negative I should be clear that it didnt impress me in a good or bad way  It was very well situated my room was very clean and the bellmen were very pleasant  I felt that the restaurant room service and mini bar were very expensive   even by hotel standards  The fitness center and pool were okay  I reached the concierge once in  attempts by phone and on that occasion I was on hold for so long that I hung up  You probably need to speak to the concierge in person in order to avail yourself of their assistance  
P => Hotel is O K  but Concierge is amazing  It is a good hotel for  a night  Nothing special about it  Only two things stand out   Location Right off the Mag Mile    Staff Room staff was friendly  Concierge was awesome I must commend them all but specially Kaitlyn Lawlor  She had it all charm speed and the best memory Ive seen  If I were to stay there again I would ask if she still works there  Her job really made a difference  
P => Not a great experience at the price point We stayed at the Wyndham Chicago for one night in ust  The hotel was busy so the only rate available was a rather expensive rate  While the room was large the layout was awkward and the room was not very clean  The complimentary water bottles on the table had been opened and used and there were dirty towels in the corner when we checked in  At this price point we could have stayed at the Four Seasons or the Penninsula and had a much better experience  Average at best  The location was the best part about the stay  
P => Great experience comfort and class Wyndham Chicago Everything what makes a good Hotel Clean beautiful and very comfortable room  Good linen and service at any time that we requested  Nice and warm personnel  Good installations in the Gym  Excellent location  Loved it 
P => Another Great Stay at the Wyndham Just returned from a three night stay at the Wyndham  Everything was perfect from Ismail at the front desk to Dennean the By Request manager  Our room was wonderful the daily breakfast included in our package was excellent my kids had a blast and the service was friendly  I cant recommend this hotel enough and were already talking about our next return  You also cant beat the location of this hotel  Yes there are sirens as the hotel is across the street from a hospital  However we were on the th floor and it was definitely tolerable  Its a city   cities are loud  We dealt with it  Basically dont let that detour you from staying here  And if youre not happy with something dont hesitate to ask  I can honestly say that this is by far the friendliest hotel weve stayed at in Chicago  Every employee we talked to was kind and acted like they truly cared about their job  
P => Great Location and very nice staff  Watch out with that Do Not Disturb Sign I stayed at the Wyndham for  nights after a conference in nearby St Charles  Overall I liked the hotel  This was my second stay in Chicago and I preferred the location of this hotel over the more expensive one I stayed in last time  It is so close to everything  We literally walked everywhere from this hotel  The staff especally the bellmen was nice and the room was modern and clean  One thing that bothered me was that I left the quotDo Not Disturbquot sign on the door so that they wouldnt come in and clean the room while we were gone  It really wasnt a necessity for us  I dont know who took it upon themselves to remove the sign and clean the room anyways  Had I known this I would have put away my belongings instead of having them lying about  In all fairness to them I could have called and told them I did not need room service  But I do the same thing in most hotels I go to and have never had someone remove the sign and come into the room anyways  Also the next morning we had the sign on the door and a cleaning lady knocked at and tried to open the door anyways  Someone should clarify with the cleaning service what the quotDo Not Disturb Signquot means  
P => Great Hotel for a Family For my first time in Chicago I did a spreadsheet on hotels for a two night stay and I chose the Wyndham for the price location and size of suite  Pros Early check in   we checked in at  pmSize of room    sq foot suite with a door between bedroom and living roomShower pressure and towels were both goodConsNoise   No fault of Wyndham but every hour in the bedroom you could hear an ambulance that was about as loud as an alarm clock for about  secondsRestaurant   Too fancy and pricey for young kids who do not eat much but there are about  bakeries within a block of the place We would stay here again and I give it a thumbs up  
P => Thumbs up Suites were big clean and comfortable  Great location and would recommend to families traveling with children  Oh by the way the kids like the pool and they have a nice work out facility  
P => Awesome Location and Great Staff I had the pleasure of staying at the Wyndham for  solid weeks and staid at the Wyndham  The staff at this hotel is exceptional  Everyone is friendly and helpful  The concierge was always excellent at offering suggestions and making arrangements  No task was too small  The even called down to The Capital Grille and ordered my desert for me so that it would be ready when I got there  The location is fantastic centrally located and one block south of Michigan Ave  The rooms were very nice  So you are close to shopping and restaurants but away from the hustle by only one block  The Caital Grille is connected to the hotel and there are fantastic restaurants all around and within walking distance  Perfect location  You can even see Lake Michigan from the hotel and its about a  minute walk to get down to the lake and the Navy Pier  
P => Perfect location  Great hotel  Best deal  The Wyndham in downtown Chicago is the perfect place to stay for someone interested in a downtown location without the astronomical price  The room was very clean and beds comfortable after a long day of walking the city  The staff was great The breakfast included can not be beat  Fresh berries and fruit and eggs made to order served on the fourth floor corner  Perfect for eating and watching people on the street  Our waiter was wonderful The pool area is a little on the small side and the hot tub is situated very close to the pool making it a little difficult to relax  This hotel seemed to attract families with young children so if this isnt your scene you  want to look elsewhere  The location was a very safe neighborhood one block from Michigan Ave and easy to access sites by walking or public transport  I will stay here again when I return to Chicago  
P => Good overall Pros The hotel was clean amp conveniently located near the Magnificent Mile Navy Pier amp other tourist attractions  The staff were very friendly amp helpful Cons It is right across the street from Northwestern Hospital Trauma center and my family amp I were awakened several times a night with ambulance sirens we were all the way on the th floor but were still awakened by the sirens  Parking is outrageously over priced They charged us a daily fee to use the wi fi 
P => Great Service  We stayed at the Chicago Wyndham Downtown this past weekend y  th due to a wedding reception being held there  From previous reviews I called      and spoke to a Mr  Wilson  He was extremely nice said it was only a minute and half walk to the Wyndham I think it was even less than a minute  Cost was  minus a  dollar discount so the cost was  per day verses  at the hotel  You could come and go as much as you wanted  Once we parked the car there was never a need to get it out again everything is within walking distance  The car attendants were very pleasant and helpful  Check in at the Wyndham went very smooth  Earlier I had signed up for their Wyndham Rewards and was able to receive free internet  Again from previous reviews I asked for a room away from the hospital  Aaron at the front desk was extremely accomodating and placed us on the th floor away from any hospital noise  The room was very large and the bed extremely comfortable  The bathroom was large with nice amenities  My husband used the workout and pool facilities that were on th floor  There was a wide range of equipment  The pool amp whirlpool area was small but very clean For a quick breakfast we went to the Corner Bakery which was kiddie corner from the hotel or else you could go in the opposite direction to Dunkin Donuts  We did eat in the bar area of the hotel one day for lunch  They ran a  special that also included a drink  The food was very good and the service was excellent  We had a window table so we could watch all the people walking by  Friday night we ate a Ginos Pizzeria which is only  blocks north corner of Superior amp St  Clair  The line formed down the alley but it moved at a pretty good pace  We were told it would be  minute wait and but were seated in  minutes Michigan Avenue is only one block west  This hotel is a easy walking distance to all the major stores  Art Fest was going on near the Wrigley Building so that was fun to check out The wedding reception we attended at the Wyndham was like clock work  The service and food were very good  If you are thinking about doing a reception there as a guest I was very impressed with how organized everything was  
P => Pleasant Stay Stayed in Wyndham for a little Michigan Ave shopping prior to visiting the University of Chicago on a college road trip  Booked through TravelZoo and got a great rate with a suite upgrade  Great Location  We had a king suite that was spacious and welcoming  The breakfast in the dining room was outstanding  We have not seen that fresh of fruits on a breakfast buffet EVER  Highly recommend  Less than  mile from Millineum station   block off Michigan  Great location for us  Bed comfortable  Do not recommend for families appeared more business and professional oriented  
P => Comfy bed shower pressure and convenient location The Wyndham Chicago is conveniently located in downtown Chicago  It is easily accessible by the train CTA by taking the blue line to the red line or if you have lots of luggage then the blue line to a   cab ride  Michigan Avenue shopping is a couple blocks away and so are some of the major attractions like navy pier and some of the museums  The one problem we had with the hotel location was its proximity to a hospital  Luckily we noticed the noisy ambulances on our way to check in so we specifically requested a room on one of the upper floors  We think this worked as we didn t hear them in our room The room was quite spacious   with a very COMFORTABLE king size bed down comforter and down pillows  We definitely got a good night s sleep  The bathroom was large and nicely orated with granite counters  One of my pet peeves when travelling is the amount of shower pressure  Happy to say this one passed the test I was able to get all the shampoo out of my hair easily  The room was equipped with internet access for a fee TV mini bar  fridge and free coffee There was a dining area on the nd floor with a reasonably priced menu   everything for   However we didn t eat there  There are just so many places in downtown Chicago we wanted to try out and they were just a quick walk downstairs There were multiple people managing the Concierge desk so the wait to speak to someone wasn t long  The Concierge was very knowledgeable and often gave us very specific walking directions  maps to wherever we wanted to go  There was also somewhere to leave your luggage on the st floor  We used this on the way in and out as our flight times did not match the check in time of p and check out of a All in all we really enjoyed our stay  The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure  We were in the heart of everything we wanted to see yet not directly in the midst of the tourists   for a very reasonable price  We would definitely stay there again  
P => A true pleasure  Wanting to stay in the Michigan Mile area for my first time Chicago visitor friend I debated between this property and several others near the Magnificent Mile   including the Allerton the Four Points Sheraton and the Courtyard riott  I am so pleased with my ision to stay at the Wyndham  Booking on the Wyndham website offered me the best rate  Check in couldnt have been more efficient and smooth  I was offered an upgrade to a Corner Suite for  extra a nite  I wanted to see the difference so at first I lined  The standard room I was given was nice and clean and well appointed  Had it been just me traveling it might have been ok  The view was not spectacular in this room as I guess many on that side of the hotel are since they directly face a  story wall next door  Like I said for the business traveler or someone who doesnt mind that view it would have been just fine I wanted to have a lil more room and a great view for my first time guest so I opted for the suite  I can honestly say this was the best  I spent all weekend  per nite  It made ALL the DIFFERENCE  The room was larger by about  sq feet or more and the view from  huge windows was great  Just what we needed The hotel itself was very quiet all weekend and the staff and housekeeping never bothered us at all  The bathrooms were all ble and very updated and also had a full size tub too I am reaching to find ANY vice but the only one that I can account for is the Northwestern Hospital across the street  The quotalmost every  minutequot ambulance arrivals were annoying at first but cant make a dent in the overall enjoyment of our stay  But this of course is not the fault of the hotel so they still get top ks from me The trick is get a high floor room and these sirens  fade a tad Across the street what luck A Corner Bakery    grab breakfast and then hit the townDo your homework but for me this will be my choice for a repeat visit to the Windy City Thanks Wyndham 
P => Very nice   great place to relax after a hard day of being a tourist We had a wonderful stay at the Wyndham Chicago for two days in e  The room was clean and very comfortable and it was great to return to our hotel and enjoy the sauna steam room hot tub and pool next to the fitness center  Great hotel 
P => Classy but Affordable I stayed here before and still like it  The lobby hallways and rooms are all nicely furnished and orated  The staff especially is worth returning for    the employees I dealt with were all very nice efficient and accommodating  I couldnt figure out how to set the clock and my kids werent with me to do it for me so the hotel promptly sent up the engineer    who took care of the problem  He also turned off the alarm next door I think they must have had a brief power outage due to thunderstorms  I had a room  on the next to top floor with a pretty good view for this hotel   other buildings in downtown Chicago  The room was nice enough although they still have the old style TVs  I would have liked HDTV for the NBA playoffs  Im also not crazy about the single cup coffee makers  The two pods they provide equal two small cups of coffee in the morning  I need more  Other than that the room was fine    the bed was comfortable there were sufficient outlets and an armchair and hassock to relax on I like having Wyndham by Request which gives me my choice two bottles of Coke two bottles of water and a bag of mixed nuts    all waiting on my desk for my arrival the first day Room service for dinner was very disappointing this time    almost inedible  I had the same meal that I enjoyed immensely back in uary braised boneless short ribs on noodles with an awful topping of horseradish creme fraiche  I wonder if be they changed management or cooks in the restaurant It sounds like Im complaining a lot but I would definitely stay here again  Its very convenient to downtown Chicago and a genuinely nice place to stay This is a classy hotel but an affordable one  
P => Good Location Clean Rooms ent Value We liked this Wyndam for its location and clean updated rooms  You are two blocks from Crate and Barrell on MichiganErie and  blocks from Lake Michigan  There is a nice lobby on the nd floor as well  The rooms are well appointed with all you would expect from a  star hotel  Our king room was clean and comfortable  Our only beef was that there was a buzzing sound which is pretty common in these older Chicago buildings  It sounded like someone was showering or running the ac the entire time  We asked housekeeping and they said the hotel could not fix it  So dont expect an entirely sound proof room Overall a good choice for downtown Chicago  
P => The  Faux W  is the next best thing When I go to Chicago I like to stay at the W Lakeshore and on one trip the hotel was full so I booked at the Wyndham  I joked with friends that I was staying at the quotfaux Wquot  I must say I was very happy with the Wyndham and would stay here again Pros Staff and Concierge were very knowledgeable about nightlife and restaurants in Chicago  The staff was also very friendly and willing to help  Rooms and beds were huge  Perfect location    A two minute walk to Michigan Ave and close to Gold Coast Rush Street Lake Michigan  Cons For young singles this is not a quotscenequot with a great bar or restaurant  
P => Great Stay at the Wyndham Chicago Downtown Stayed this past weekend at the Wyndham to celebrate my dhters birthday at AG Place  We arrived at pm and were checked in right away  I am a Wyndham ByRequest member and when I got to the room I was pleased to see that all of my requests extra towels amp coffee a room on a high floor had been granted  Also as a ByRequest member I received a quotwelcome ammenityquot of cheese crackers soda and bottled water  In addition we were automatically granted a pm checkout all of this at no extra charge  Every employee we encountered at the hotel went out of their way to be friendly it gave the hotel such a warm feel  Concierge was very helpful as this was our first time in Chicago they gave us explicit walking directions to everywhere we wanted to go a card that would cut our wait time at Ginos East and a special robe and American Girl magazine for my dhter  We did have room service for breakfast  It was pricey no surprise but portion sizes were generous  Four of us ordered individual breakfasts and we could have easily ordered  and split the meals  The meals included hot oatmeal a bread a fresh fruit bowl juice and then a huge carafe of coffee was brought along with the breakfasts  We walked up and down Michigan Ave  and also walked to the Navy Pier  This hotel is in a great location  We are planning a return visit this summer and will definitely book this hotel  The only negative we discovered that is out of the hotels control are the loud sirens from the hospital across the street  I slept with a pillow over my head to try to block out some of the sound 
P => Excellent hotel right on the gold coast If you want a beautiful updated hotel just off Michigan Ave this is an a great hotel to visit My family lives one hour north of Chicago but wanted to spend a weekend in the city  We chose the Wyndham because of its proximity to Michigan Ave and it is one of the few hotels in the area with an indoor pool  I didnt eat at their restaurants so I have no idea how the food is  The hotel staff were very attentive and the rooms were updated with comfortable beds  We were within walking distance of Water Tower Place Mall as well as many other restaurants and stores  Public transportation trolley cab buses L train will take you where ever you want to go  No frig in room  
P => Wonderful place to stay We stayed at this hotel before and we knew what to expect and what we would get and this is the reason why we have chosen this hotel again The location right next to the Magnificent Mile is unbeatable the hotel is in walking distance to the Water Place North Ave Beach et cetera The staff is very helpful trying to make things happen  The only downside I noticed is the wireless internet in the rooms  Speed and signal strength is poor and it does happen that you lose your connection which is double annoying if you paid  for  hours for it  Wireless should be complimentary in all hotels Besides that this is a wonderful place to stay and I would stay there again  
P => Great Value Super Great Personnel Best Location This is my second stay at this property in downtown Chicago  I attend a conference in Chi Town annually but forgot how much I like this place until my recent stay  First the few negatives The pool was closed on two days of my four day visit   the hotel is located across the street from a major medical center  I heard sirens three times  Niether of these two minor things inconvenienced me Now on to the many positives  the staff exudes midwestern charm  Very friendly willing to help you when you need it and never seem to get annoyed when you ask them a question theyve heard  times   the property is small enough that the service staff get to know you after only a couple of days  As a single female traveler this is quite comforting  I was in and out of my room several times on the first and second day of my stay  By the end of the second night the front desk people were greeting me by name   by doing my homework and joining the Wyndham quotBy Requestquot club free at Wyndham com I saved a bunch and also got some good perks   wine and cheese delivered to my room on my arrival free room upgrade when available they said and free wireless internet access   I booked this room using the quotinternet ratequot which requires an immediate payment with no cancel but also gives you a rock bottom rate  Mine was night   at least  lower than other properties in the area    and very cheap by city standards   the room I was given was almost comically huge  Here I was in Chicago for a conference by myself and I had an quotExecutive Suitequot with a living room that I would guess to be around x  It had a fold out queen couch two chairs an armoir with tv and mini bar and a business desk with ergonomic chair   The bathroom was huge and featured ble fixtures  The bedroom was arated by french doors and was also large   approx  x with a comfortable king bed and the Wyndham bedding and pillows   Location Location Location  This hotel is in the center of all that is great about Chicago  For shop a holics Magnificent Mile is only a couple of blocks away   fantastic food can be found on literally every block adjacent to the property  Great blues and jazz clubs are a short walk try Andys Jazz Club Navy Pier is six blocks  The best architecture in the U S  is in this city   and thats coming from a New Yorker 
P => One big problem but they fixed it right away My boyfriend and I stayed at the Wyndham this past weekend for Valentines day  The location of this hotel is GREAT We took the South Shore to Chicago and then walked straight to the hotel probably a good   blocks which is fine with us  We walked to every restaurant that wanted to eat at over the weekend and about a five dollar cab ride to State and Division for some bar hopping  There was one really big problem but the staff was great and helped us out  We checked into our room and we were hoping to take a nap for a couple hours before heading out to dinner and we kept hearing this loud banging noise  At first we thought that the noise was from doors slamming but after some investigation we realized that it had to be the pipes and the water pressure  We could not take the noise so we went straight to the front desk and complained  They immediately gave us another room and that room was excellent  No noise The first room was on the th floor and our second room was on the th floor  I would definitely recommend the hotel just stay away from room   Other than that the front desk and the concierge were great 
P => Enjoyed my Stay very much Upon arriving at the Ohare airport I took the CTA close to the hotel  I recommend that you take the CTA to the ClarkDivision and hail a cab to the hotel  It is a great place to shop and eat  Upon arriving at the hotel Esmerelda checked me in and was very gracious in accomodating me in a room that I would like as well as secure my valuables in the hotel safe  This area is a very safe area and was once a bank building that has been reated into a hotel  It is adjacent with a surgeon center and Capital Grille  Since my room wasnt quiet ready and I was there earlier than check in time I walked up the road for lunch at Boston Blackies    check my review out on that one  After arriving back to the hotel  and upgrading to a Corner King for  a night I found the room to be comfortable  It had large windows not floor to cieling but large windows with a nice king size bed a TV with limited cable channels not a flat screen a love seat with a coffee table could have been updated and a nice secretaries desk with a desk chair  The linens where very comfortable as well as the pillows and a large bathroom which the Housekeeper Anna ie had prepared very nicely  The hotel offers a pool sauna whirlpool steamroom and excersize equiptment  I was very nice well kept and the treadmills looked over the high rise buildings outside  The Bathroom had great hot water and pressure and offered Bath and Body Works True Spa amenities  The concierge desk was very helpful with accomadating me on places to eat  I booked a volunteer at the cultural center and we went on a walk  She showed me many sites and the service is free  Book ahead and take the bus  blocks up the road to get there  They will give you a free day ticket on the CTA  We walked through the Theatre District took the subway to Argyle Street and shopped at Oriental Stores and a bakery  We stopped by a post office and shipped my package back home as well as walked through Lincoln Park in the snow Second City and ended up in Old Towne  We also ate Dim Sum   Funerama check out my review  While in Second city I purchased a ticket for their Monday show  She gave me directions to get back to the hotel and I walked down Dearborn Street which is quiet old Chicago  Once I had breakfast at the onsite restaurant and the Lemon Meyer Pancakes with Scrambled Eggs where great  There is a great restaurant for breakfast a couple of blocks up from the hotel called the West Egg see my review    The TGIF that is up the road is a place to skip totally  Their is a Crate amp Barrel withing walking distance and you are just about a block from the Mag Mile  Use of the CTA was easy and although older I felt safe  The staff here was great 
P => very good stay This is our second stay at this hotel it is in perfect walking distance to many shoppping and eating venues  The front desk staff very helpful and courteous and the rooms very well aportioned and very clean  I used the gym daily with nice new exercise equipment  The only negative close to a ER  We heard lots of sirens but what do you expect you are in the middle of the city  
P => We never complain but        my husband and I stayed at the Wyndahm  nights to celebrate the New Year and to have a last quotgetaway quot before we have our first child in  months  I booked our room with points that we had accumulated through our credit card and this was the only option for a downtown Chicago location  On initial entry to the hotel I was pleased after finding a place to park    good luck Our room was clean and as the day progressed into night that is when we started to regret our choice in hotel  First off our room was directly across from the hospital  Sirens all night For a light sleeper like my husband not a fun thing to hear in the night  When sitting on the bed the comforter is very soft pull that thing back and you will be sleeping on a rock  Strike three    the thermostat  The fan will not stay on and the lowest the temperature will go is   Being pregnant I was sleeping in my sweat all night and on a hard bed listening to sirens  The kicker     a loud thud happening anywhere from every  minutes to every  seconds depends on the time of day and how busy the hotel is  This constant thud was the pipes running through the hotel for water pressure  It sounded like doors slamming constantly  REALLY ANNOYING My husband slept with ear plugs the second night  I was so exhausted from walking so much in the city that I only woke up a few times to the sirens  One last thing I noticed being pregnant didnt bother my husband was the counter tops in the bathroom  I am  and  weeks pregnant the counter hit me directly in my belly and had a difficult time using the sink or putting on makeup in the mirror  I had to sit on the counter to get anything done    also not safe if pregnant  We did not have to shell out any of our cash for the rooms but I am disappointed that our hard earned points went to these two nights in Chicago  The only thing going for it was the location and the corner bakery across the street for breakfast    since it is not included at the hotel  I would not stay there again  
P => Wyndham Chicago was THE best First of all we got an unbelievable rate of  a night through expedia and things just went up from there  The hotel was beautiful inside and out the staff was great especially one of the front desk ladies we became fast friends  When booking this hotel i read some reviews about people being bothered by ambulances and stuff because the hospital was literally direclty across the street u could walk from the hotel door straight across the road to the hosipital door but i can honestly say that didnt bother us at all  no sirens kept us up  Everyone we came into conctact with was extremely helpful and the hotels location was close to everything  My party consisted of me my sister and a friend and although we just got backj home we are already making plans to go back next year 
P => Great location clean rooms I booked through the hotels website for  per night which is a great price for the quality of the hotel the rooms were clean the beds were nice not the best but i slept well average size rooms with enough room to relax the bathroom was larger than usual which was nice for  girls to get ready in the morning  There was wine and cheese ready in our room upon our arrival due to the free Wyndam rewards program  The staff was very nice and helpful when needed  Never had any problems with noise  Each room had its own thermostat so you could adjust the temp as needed  The view as OK but that defiantly does not matter to me  The location is the reason I chose this hotel and it was perfect a block off Michigan ave and a short walk to almost anywhere you would want to be I would defiantly stay here again I have stayed at nicer hotels in Chicago but have payed a lot more too 
P => Fabulous Location Fabulous location and great hotel  The front desk and concierge staff went above and beyond to be helpful  The bed was so comfortable I didnt want to leave it in the morning  The fitness room was well equipped for a downtown hotel  Dont eat breakfast at one of the corporate options nearby instead walk around the corner to  E  Ontario and eat at Momis Cafe  Monis has organic and fair trade tea and coffee crepes great breakfast options and it is locally owned 
P => Perfect I could not recommend this Hotel more highly  We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of ember and got a great deal of   discount by booking through Expedia  The Hotel is in an ideal location just a block from Michigan Avenue the main shopping street  I stayed there with my Mum and we never had any concerns about going to and from the Hotel as two women even when it was dark  The staff were always friendly and could not have been more helpful  The room was spacious the beds were huge and very comfortable there was a big closet and the bathroom was spotless and had lots of free toiletries in it what more can you ask for I really liked the fact that we got a free USA Today newspaper left outside the door each day  We didnt have any meals at the Hotel although there is a restaurant because we tried the Corner Bakery across the street on the first morning and it was such good value and the food was so yummy that we kept going back there  A perfect stay 
P => Real Surprise Booked this through Hotwire for a great price so was stunned to find a hotel so centrally located near Michigan Avenue  Was further surprised by the level of comfort  This is a very nice clean comfortable hotel which has a nice luxurious feel about it  The room was large clean and well appointed  The only downside was the the cost of valet parking and internet pushed the price up a bit  I could have self parked down the road for cheaper but luggage restricted the practicality of this  Over all a nice find especially if you can get it for a good price  
P => Nice Hotel   But   We spent a long weekend at the Wyndham and I will say the staff was very friendly and courteous  The location is wonderful a block off of Michigan avenue  My only problem was that you cannot control the temperature in the room  There is a thermostat and it looks like you can set it but it does not do anything  I was way too hot durning our stay  I asked at the front desk and they said that the building engineer controlled the temp  The engineer came up within  minutes and opened up a vent and said it should help  It lowered the temp a whopping  degree  For a nice hotel this is a major inconvenience  
P => Will definitely stay here again Weve stayed at a few hotels in downtown Chicago but now we have found the one The Wyndham was a great value under  midweek  The rooms were very clean and comfortable  The staff was very friendly and accomodating late check out  And the location was perfect for us   only a block off Michigan  The nearby Corner Bakery was a convenient option for coffee and breakfasts and there is a Dominicks grocery nearby for drinks and snacks I worried about being across from the ER and hearing ambulance sirens all night but we werent bothered at all The pool was small but perfect for the kids to splash around We will definitely choose the Wyndham next time we return to Chicago  
P => Nice Hotel This is a great hotel and was a good value for night  Excellent and helpful staff  Very clean  Nice room and great bath  Comfy beds and good linens  Beautiful lobby  Good and fast valet service  Made a erate trip to our car when we realized wed forgotten a purse and promptly brought it to the room with a smile  Great conceierge  The bad noise  It is across from the hosptital sirens and noise travels through the door but not necessarily the walls  On the flip side of being across from the hospital it really is quieter than those hotels right on Michigan or Rush street  It is only a block or so off the quotmilequot but felt tucked away from the bustle  There arent many sirens and as a light sleeper I was only awoken once  That mightve just been my jet lagged system confused about the time  I would definitely stay again unless I can get the Sofitel for the same price The Sofitel does not offer  doubles  which were needed on this quotgirls weekendquot   This hotel snob would recommend it  
P => Nice room lovely bathroom free by request benefits There s been a lot of talk about hearing ambulances and I have to agree it could be a problem for a light sleeper if you re facing the hospital as we were  We were on the th floor I believe and I could hear the noise but it wasn t much more than you d expect if you were at home and an ambulance was going down the street rather muffled  I just don t sleep well away from home  It s a very conveniently located hotel so  be worth the minor noise disturbance The room we had was an upgrade because of the By Request membership which is something you sign up for and requires no money  Of course we received the complimentary drinks and snacks requested  You have several options to choose from we opted for the fruit bowl green tea and water  Also there was a large bowl of green apples at the front desk when you checked in  Much like some older hotels the front desk is on the second floor It was a nice suite with a living area with the standard TV in an armoire and a bedroom which a pair of frosted doors closed so you aren t disturbed  The bedroom had its own armoire with a TV  The bed was very comfortable nice down pillows and comforter with the duvet which seems so much cleaner  The whole bedroom wall was filled with large windows with good curtains that keep out the dark  As everyone else has mentioned the bathroom was really very nice with a wonderful scale that measured your body fat and weight once you put in your height and age  The makeup mirror was great and the products aren t just the tiny little bottles you get even at four star hotels but medium sized Bath and Beyond items that you might give in a gift set which was a nice surprise Overall the room was nice clean fresh very satisfactory  Everyone was helpful and friendly  There were only two problems  One was the Internet which I didn t mind paying for as it s not that much but my dhter wasn t able to get it hooked up  She didn t call for assistance either and I didn t find out until too late so that might not have been a problem  The second was that the cable stations kept going out  She didn t call about that either though so be it won t be a problem for anyone else  I should mention in the morning the stations seemed fine  We didn t use room service or try the buffet or even the restaurant though I did have drink in the bar with a friend and enjoyed the atmosphere  They had several TV s with sports on though there was no noise to disturb our conversation  We sat on the couch which was nice and comfortable  The waitress was prompt and pleasant I must add that thanks to other reviewers we avoided another problem which was using the hotel s valet service  They charge   a night and while I understand parking is horrible in downtown Chicago right next door to them to the right was a perfectly adequate parking garage with valet service as well  E  Erie Parking phone number is    should you want to contact them before hand  The sign said they charged   on a weekend for  hours but the kind gentleman said there was a   discount which was applied  I can t say enough about this garage  The two men were so kind and helpful  They told us we could easily get whatever we needed out of our car at any time  The convenience service and price were unbeatable and the best thing is that there was barely a five minute wait Also when I accidentally left a bag beside the chair my dhter had been waiting in they ked it and had it ready when I returned twenty minutes later after having had to turn around on the Interstate and go back  If I went back to Chicago I would be very pleased to stay at this hotel and park at the same garage again though I d make it two nights instead of one there s just so much to see  
P => good hotel The Wyndham hotel is in a great location right next to the magnificent mile although it is a small walk to the nearest train stop  The rooms are very nice with an old style or that is very comfortable  The stafff are also very friendly and we had a positive stay overall  We were in Chicago myself and my girlfriend for five days and I would recommend that people allow as least five days in the city if possible as there is a lot to see and do  
P => Second stay at this Wyndham We stayed at this property last summer and found the price and service to be worth a return visit  The valet service bell staff and concierge are all above average  The location is in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance of all the best that Chicago has to offer  Only complaint was that we were supposed to get a few perks snacks free local calls for being Wyndham By Request members  Last year it was automatic  This year we had to ask for everything despite the fact that our membership number was on the reservation  
P => Lovely BUT        I received a great rate on a last minute booking from priceline  The desk clerk was friendly and upgraded us to a King Suite when I told her it was my sons going away to college trip  The lobby was nice and no big deal going to the second floor  The room was huge and beautiful the bathroom fabulous  The concierges were friendly and very helpful on both occassions Here is the BUT   although we were on the top floor the hospital next door had an ambulance arrive at  in the am that screamed the siren for a good  minutes  It felt like it was right outside the window Other reviews mentioned this so unless you are a heavy sleeper you  want to avoid the hoteltoo bad because it is in a great location and the place is very nice  
P => Would Come Back Again Had a fantastic stay at the Wyndham The lobby was beautiful and check in was quick and easy  Because I had signed up to be a Byrequest member a plate of cheese and crackers and two small bottles of Pepsi were waiting for us in our lovely clean room  The bathrooms were perfect for us  it was very clean had granite countertops a large framed mirror and bath amp body works products for us to use  The location is perfect a few steps away from Michigan Ave and not to far from Navy Pier  The only downside was that our view was of the wall of the building next door but that wasnt a problem for us at all since we spent most of our time out in the city  Also Ginos famous for their deep dish pizza is only a block away Sadly we found this out after checking out and on our way home  
P => Wyndham Chicago St  Clair Didnt need a car This was businesspleasure and it was a nice little weekend getaway  Its located near a hospital so you hear sirens alot but for some reason would quite down later in the night  The beds were very comfortable  I agree with the other person that the concierge was very helpful  The concierge is located right near the main elevators so you cant help but use them  As always I recommend getting a room without any adjoining door  We were lucky and had quiet people in the room next to us  Can they come up with hotels that muffle hallwayother room noise please The parking is high there but its high most places downtown  It was nice to walk most places nearby for shows or boat tours or just shopping  If you look out the hotel window there is a little cafe across the street called Coco Pazzo that had the best food  I highly recommend this place  Ginos is nearby and has a outside patio  The cafes were very quaint during the warm summer nights  I felt like I was in Europe  The hotel restaurant was really good too  We only ate there for lunch  Good service  I would stay here again  Great couple getaway  
P => Comfortable and great location Very comfortable room Great location  Lots of good restaurants nearby  Walking distance to lots of sights and easy to get to transportation Friendly and helpful staff Furnishings were high quality  
P => Great stay at the Wyndham The Wyndham Hotel is located  block from the Magnificent Mile  We had a great experience at this hotel  We stayed in a non smoking room with a single king size bed  The rooms were clean comfortable and you couldnt ask for a better location for a first time visit to Chicago The Concierge made our stay in Chicago a great one  Great tips on what to do in the city and they made reservations for us whenever we needed them  This by far was one of our best mini vacations we have ever had and the Wyndham had a lot to do with it  
P => bed bugs The beds were both uncomfortable and had bed bugs When I woke up after a very unrestful nights sleep the matress was exposed and my feet and ankles had been bitten numerous times  I counted over  bites on one foot and leg  
P => Above Average   but Ive had better in Downtown Chicago Came down with girlfriends for two nights in ember to see the Oprah show and do some Michigan Avenue Christmas shopping  We wanted to save on money so four of us gals figured we could cram into one room for two nights  The beds however were way too narrow for grown women to share Id say a little bigger than a twin size bed  Really unacceptable for a standard room  People expect at least queen sized beds  Anyway we managed and I guess other than the narrow beds it was otherwise good  I stayed at the Sheraton a few months earlier for about the same price and have to say the Sheraton offered so much more  Given the choice Id take the Sheraton any day over the Wyndam  If you can get a good cheap last minute deal with the Wyndam then youll probably be satisfied however if you pay more than  per night for this place youve been had  
P => Great Hotel Great Location in walking distance to the best shopping of the Magnificent Mile and great restaurants  The Hotel is beautiful we had a  double bed room which was quite large the bedding was fabulous and the beds very comfortable  ble bathroom and dressing area  Highly recommend and we are very picky 
P => Great location I was able to get the Wydham on priceline for night  What a great deal The hotel is nice and close to many restaurants and shopping  We walked EVERYWHERE  It was a great way to spend a few summer nights in Chicago  Yes you hear ambulances go by and the view isnt all that great but for  I cant complain  Our intentions werent to stay in the hotel but to enjoy Chicago and the Wyndham provided a nice place to sleep at night  The beds were big and comfortable and the room was clean  We will definitely stay at the Wydham again  
P => Wyndham is a new Chicago favorite We spend a few long weekends every year in Chicago and this time we opted to try the Wyndham Hotel with our two young children  and   We had a lovely experience  The hotel is immaculate and if you were to ask my husband Im ridiculously fussy the room was clean and bright moderately sized great linens large and clean bathroom the pool was small but terrific with adjacent locker rooms as well as unisex sauna and steam rooms and the workout room was great it even opened  minutes early   at  a m  I often am frustrated by workout facilities that dont open early enough  The best part The location  It was amazing to us that just one block off Miracle Mile traffic can diminish so considerably in fact the intersections around the Wyndham are ked by stop signs not traffic lights  The Wyndham is amid high rise residences hotels and office buildings but quaint and so quiet at ground level  A larger Corner Bakery a breakfast favorite is across the street with indoor and outdoor seating  TGI Fridays is down the street as are other eateries but again youre just a block off Miracle Mile and blocks from Rush Street so the eating and shopping opportunities are endless  We also liked that it is located about midway northsouth on the Mile making everything so convenient  Wyndham staff members were exceedingly polite and helpful from the doorman to the concierge and front desk  Always holding doors asking if we needed help talking to our children    just great  When we arrived we were given a room with a view of a concrete wall and asked to be moved which was done without question  Our new view was great    and just a few floors up  The room was a bit larger too  We didnt eat in the hotel restaurants but they were crowded at meal times   a good sign  If there was any drawback and Im not sure this even qualifies its that the hotel doesnt have a large lobby  While its elegant it doesnt invoke the opulence or hum with the activity of some of the larger or older hotels like the Drake or the Intercontinental  But its lovely ble floors curved staircase pianist at the baby grand elegant furniture and quiet The Wyndham is a new Chicago favorite for us  
P => Nice Hotel But Noisey This was the third time I have stayed here and have been satisfied each time  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are very large  for downtown chicago The service is good and the rates are usually better than most  I booked a room with a king sized bed thru the hotel web site for  per night My biggest complaint is the hotels close proximity to Northwestern hospital  If your room is on the hospital side you will her ambulances usually several per night  A minor annoyance is the need to take one elevator to get to the lobby and then change elevators to get to your room In the category of Mich  ave area hotwels for under  per night I think this hotel is one of the best  Over  Id look at Sofitel or Omni  
P => Yuck I stayed here for business last month and fortunately it wasnt MY money I was spending    It started with my arrival   my flight had been VERY delayed out of Seattle due to a snowstorm in Chicago so I arrived around  p m  tired and hungry  The three young women at the front desk were discussing their quotmyspacequot profiles and hardly looked up when I arrived  They gave me my room key and I asked them quotis there somewhere in the hotel I can get foodquot They said quotoh yes you can get food in the bar until quot I thanked them and went up to my room They had put me in a quotsuitequot but it was a smoking room and smelled TERRIBLY of smoke I had specifically requested a non smoking room and paid extra for it I went into the bathroom and found it disgustingly dirty  Someone had clearly been sick on the toilet and it had NOT been cleaned since   it was disgusting  The towels in the bathroom were also dirty with hair stuck to them and crumpled on the hangers as if theyd been used and then hung back up I called the front desk and the girl said shed send someone up  I waited  minutes and someone showed up with a long metal pole to quotunclog the toiletquot  I explained the situation to the man at the door and he told me Id need to call back downstairs  When I did the girl said quotI just sent someone up to unclog itquot and I had to spell out for her what the exact nature of the probelm was  They sent someone else up  minutes later to clean the bathroom  The man who cleaned the bathroom said quotit looks like somebody has been in your room since it was cleanedquot as if it was very normal When I finally made it down to the bar it was about  p m  They told me they had stopped serving food a few minutes before  I told them I had been told they were open until   They shrugged and told me some local places that had food at this hour there was a snowstorm   I didnt really feel like walking  blocks for food  I was very annoyed because I would have eaten first if Id known they were closing So I went to bed quite hungry the front desk girls hadnt offered me a mini bar key or else I would have at least had a snack and couldnt sleep most of the night since my pillows reeked of cigarettes  Blech The next day I complained at the front desk and was moved to a new room which was great   but the first night was a total disaster  I wont be staying here again if I can help it 
P => Nice but the nickel and dime stuff is annoying  I booked this hotel because it was listed as a quotgood valuequot and quotcustomer favoritequot on Hotwire we booked Holy Thursday Easter Monday   I was happy to learn Id booked the Wyndham a chain I am usually pleased with The hotel is about a block off Michigan Ave  in the Magnificent MileStreeterville area  Its an easy walk to Watertower place and a reasonable walk to the loop  We used both the El and bus to visit other parts of Chicago and found bus stop and the underground station at Grand easy to locate within a short walk Valet parking is expensive  a night I think  We opted to self park for around  a night about  a block away in the ramp on St  Clair adjacent to the Courtyard by riott The hotwire rate did not include breakfast although I think some of the packages booked directly with the hotel do  There were apples and mints at the front desk but not coffee service something weve experienced at other  star hotels  There was a mini bar and small coffee pot in the room with some pedestrian no brand coffee no stirrers sugar etc  There is a tiny Starbucks with a perpetually long line across the street next door to the Parking Garage mentioned above a Dunkin Donuts steps away and a Corner Bakery and Panera very near  The room itself was fine  We were on the th nee th floor we figured thats where they hide the hotwire cheapskates  If we peeked around the tall buildings we could see the lake  The room had two double beds w down comforters and pillows an upholstered reading chair w table and a desk with a lovely aeron chair easily the most comfortable piece of furniture in the room  Wyndam has not yet abandoned amoires as many of the upscale hotels are doing nor have they upgraded to flat screen televisions  The room felt a little cramped w all the furniture in it  In fact we moved the occasional table to the closet because we couldnt otherwise set up a cot for the teen we had in tow  The cable package was limited to a handful of choices but what the heck we didnt go to Chicago to watch TV     The phone on the night table did not work This must be a hotel that in general caters to business travelers with expense accounts  Internet service was something like   a day in the room and a whopping  cents PER MINUTE in the business center  We walked to Panera andor the Apple store both within blocks where we could at no charge check our email and look up and write down information on the places we wanted to visit  The concierge printed my boarding pass for free but I had to pay to sign on note credit card machine attached to computer does not take American Express and look up my reservation number which Id forgotten to bring with me  I requested a cot for my teen aged son and gulped when I learned it would cost me  a night extra  However this charge was never posted to my account  The cot only fit in one spot in the room between the bed by the window and the desk provided we moved the aeron chair out of the way  We stood it up each morning so we could move freely around the room There is no charge to use the gym which surprised me it had a changing room showers and a ent selection of treadmills bikes etc  and free weights  It was never crowded when I used the facility The hotel has a tiny shallow  feet at the deep end pool hot tub steam sauna and dry sauna  The pool was crowded all weekend even the hot tub was full of very young children toddler to early elementary splashing around w their parents  The pool area was not monitored well by the staff dirty towels piled up in and around the hamper  On several occasions we had to dry off with the hand sized towels from the attached gym because there were not clean towels in the pool area  By and large the concierge staff was helpful and friendly if their knowledge of the city was limited to the tourist spots  Our query for directions to the Benedictine Monastery south of the loop roughly st and Halsted in the Bridgeport neighborhood was met at first with a blank stare and then with an explanation that they dont know a lot about quotthe suburbsquot  They suggested we buy a city map at the nearby Walgreens  We found directions online during a visit to the Apple store The room was clean and housekeeping honored our request to be quotgreenquot and keep our towels and sheets for our entire stay  The water was hot and water pressure fine  The toilet has a loud whooshy flush that might wake the dead The Wyndham must do big business with their American Girl weekend package the hotel lobby was full of AG bag toting parents with glazed looks accompanied by   year old girls clutching America Girl dolls  Note to parents of boys in the same age bracket there is a LEGO store in a mall on Michigan Ave  I forget where precisely but its several blocks before Wabash  
P => Downtown Chicago The Wyndham is one block off Michigan Ave if youre looking for shopping  Getting here was an easy drive despite all the one way streets in downtown Chicago  We found parking a small problem when we tried to unload our luggage as there is not a drive through area off the street like we often find  However the bellman and others working the street were helpful and anxious to get our bags out of the snow and into the hotel Upon check in at about  p m  we were told no rooms were available with the  double beds we had requested  They were going to give us a room with a King and a hide a bed  Having done that already this trip we opted to stand firm and wait until a room with  double beds became available  The person at the front desk was pleasant and figured out a way to make it happen  I over heard the person next to me checking in though  She did not stand firm in her request and was given a room with a King and a hide a bed which didnt make her happy We strolled around downtown Chicago enjoying all it has to offer so the time went quickly  When I returned at  p m  as requested the room was ready and our bags were quickly delivered to the room by a very pleasant bell hop The room is nice   comfortable bedding and soft towels  Most of the hooks holding the shower curtain were not hooked so I fixed that while in the shower  We were also not given  soaps so had to use the small one from the sink area for everyone to shower with  And there was no shampoo only conditioner  All in all no major problems but just a lack of attention to detail  We had everything with us to get ready for the day so I did not ask housekeeping to deliver more soap  The downtown location is great for general touring of Chicago  Its also just about  minutes to the airport  Ive been to Chicago many times and would stay at the Wyndham again  
P => Great Sorry for getting this review in a bit late I stayed  nights in ober as I was attending a conference at North Western University I really didnt spend a lot of time in the room as I was either on conference walking the quotMilequot or oogling over what I wanted to buy in the Apple Store   love that place I had  breakfasts there but no lunches or dinners  The breakfast buffet was lovely   but its pretty hard to screw up a breakfast buffet  I did not use the bar the pool or the fitness facilities  I can tell you that the room was excellent I loved the location and the service could not have been better   very helpful polite and competent  The rate I got from the University was a steal    per night  I have no idea what the regular rate is though  Hope this helps  
P => The Best Hotel near the Mag Mile Our weekend was FANTASTIC Myself my sister and two friends went back to The Wyndham this past weekend for a quotGirls Getawayquot  This is our second year choosing this hotel for our winter vacation spot  Why do we keep going back Well besides the friendly accomidating staff that they have and the comfortable and clean rooms    its their concierge staff Russell is absolutely fabulous Last year when we arrived for our first trip he could NOT have been any more kind funny knowledgeable helpful or obliging to us Our weekend was top notch It was mostly because of Russell  He helped us find a lovely restaurant a place to have our spa treatments and many other tips This years weekend was also out of this world Russell and the rest of the concierge desk is the heart of the hotel and they are impeccable  They greet everyone and are sincerely concerned that you have the best visit the best and attend to your every need In my travels in the U S  and abroad I have never met a concierge like Russell  I have for the past year sent many of my family and friends to thathotel telling them to consider no other and will continue my recommendations  Thank you for your time in reading this email  
P => Nice for business I stayed at the Wyndham for one night on a business trip  The hotel was clean and classy very quiet and had a fantastic location  One of my colleagues ended up in a very nice upgrade because of a byrequest membership Id highly recommend getting one  My room was a nice size with a great desk and a very comfortable chair  The hotel had very nice soap and shampoo in the room and nice high ceilings which made the room feel spacious  We went to the hotel bar also which was very nice but extremely overpriced  I used the business center which wasnt free Free internet with the byrequest membership but was fast and had a couple computers with a printer  
P => Great choice If you want a nice hotel for business or pleasure this is an excellent pick  I stayed here while I was on business but then stayed a few extra days for fun  Its a very nice hotel for the money and in an excellent location  So if you are doing touristy things its perfect  Walking distance to the Handcock building and Michigan Ave shops  Short cab rides to all the great bars and restaurants  I would definately stay here again  
P => Great deals on a great hotel We have been fortunate twice now to get a fabulous rate of  at the Wyndham through priceline  Both times Ive been very impressed with this hotel  First the location is fabulous  Though not directly on Michigan AVE its only about a block over with a Corner bakery kitty corner and you are positioned perfectly along the shopping areas once you do hit Mich  AVE The hotel itself is lovely and clean  Feels upscale without being over the top  The rooms are more than adequate  They are not large but definitely bigger than some of he downtown Chicago hotels   Bedding is comfortable and the rooms are well appointed There are two downsides to the hotel    the parking is valet only and is a bit more expensive as a result  Still given the great rates Ive got on priceline it has evened out to a good deal  Plus the valets have always been quick and friendly    The way the hotel is set up creates an extra step when you enter as you have to use the stairs or elevator to go up a level and then you have access to the elevators that take you to your room  Not a bit deal but when youre tried after being out its a bit of an extra step  
P => Another great stay in the Wyndham This was my third stay in the Wyndam in  months anytime we travel to Chicago its where we stay  Check in was super fast they had it all waiting for us even though we were there earlier than the normal check in time  Our room was spotless and my By Request welcome pack was waiting for me in the room  The staff as usual were polite and efficient but Russell the concierge goes beyond that Hes an excellent concierge and a font of knowledge for all you might want to knowdo in Chicago The rooms are spacious and the beds  bliss  Very comfortable  Lovely big bathrooms with great amenity packs  Lots of towels also  The location of the hotel is perfect five mins from Michigan Ave and plenty of good restaurants nearby  We had breakfast one morning in the hotel its lovely to sit looking out two floors up over the street but we usually get our breakfast directly across the road in one of the Corner Bakery chain Staying there three times in  months and will stay there in the future says it all   I dont even look for an alternative hotel at this stage the Wyndham is perfect 
P => Amazing hotel Excellent location in the heart of Chicago  Large rooms and the staff treated us very well  Cant wait to be back 
P => fine for the price We actually booked this hotel with the help of Prentice Hospital where our dhter was having a baby  They will arrange with local hotels to give discounts for people using the Northwestern Hospitals  The rate was very good for the hotel  The best thing about the hotel was the staff who were VERY gracious and accomodating  Yes there are pretty frequent ambulance sirens   you are next to the Medical Schoolhospitals campus  Otherwise the location is great   in the center of everything  The rooms were standard the beds not very comfortable be the mattress we had was old   very creaky springs and I like very good quality sheets the tv options less varied than in Caribbean resorts  The pool was somewhat small   not really geared to swimming  We did not eat at the restaurant so I cant comment on that  Again the best things about the hotel are the proximity to the hospitals and the warmth and helpfulness of the staff  
P => Great stay at the Wyndham My husband and I spent a night at the Wyndham to do some holiday shopping on Michigan Ave  The location is perfect in the heart of the shopping area on North Michigan Avenue  We got a great rate for this hotel on Expedia and because the hotels computer system was down when we checked in we were upgraded to a suite The room was large clean and nicely appointed  We had dinner just across the street at Viand in the riott and wed definitely recommend that place  If youre driving Id also recommend using the hotel valet service if they have one  We didnt and paid  for an overnight at a self park down the block  
P => Amazing Hotel for the price I booked this hotel never having stayed at a Wyndham property stricltly for the location  We came in on Thanksgiving Day at the last minute as my sister was having a baby at Northwestern Memorial Hospital which is across the street  Besides this hotel being in a perfect location just off Michigan Avenue it was amazing  Spotless absolutely fantastic and attentive staff beautiful room    I could go on  We were allowed an early check in as well as a late check out because I enrolled in the Wyndham ByRequest free program  This is a neat offer as you select your choices before you make your reservation and there is a welcome snack waiting for you in your room  Ours was a bottle of Merlot cranberry juice a round of Gouda cheese and some crackers  They even brought up a plate with silverware and a napkin  Our entire one night visit was wonderful the staff couldnt have been nicer and I was just in awe that for  I got a  star  sq ft two room suite  What a great surprise I will absolutely remember this hotel if I ever need to stay in Chicago again  I  even book for next year on Thanksgiving just for the ease of getting to Michigan Avenue for shopping  It was literally steps away from all the action  
P => Heart of Chicago Our  night stay at the Wyndham was very nice cant beat the location which is in the heart of Chicago and steps from the Magnificent Mile and very close to Navy PierWe had  standard rooms which were nice clean and comfortable very comfy beds  Bathrooms were very clean and had Bath amp Body toiletries great showers Carpet in one room was a little worn with a few stains but nothing horrible  The views werent exceptional but we were on the th floor Staff at the Wyndham were all extremely nice and helpful Check  in is at  but we were able to get into one of our rooms about  which was nice We had joined Wyndham by Request for the perks but were told because we had booked through Hotels com the By Request does not link into them so we werent given the extras that we had heard about but not a big deal We parked one or two blocks down at a Self Park garage which was cheaper  for  hours I believe Overall it was very nice for the  night and reasonable for the location Restaurant on site is a bit pricey ate breakfast at the West Egg Cafe which is around the block on Fairbanks  good food wquick service 
P => Best in Location and Experience This hotel was one of the best hotel i ve stayed in and very good with the price and it pays to call this hotel direct and get a good price trust me Very world class  
P => Nice Hotel Good Location Had a quick business trip to Chicago  Just stayed one night but the hotel was really nice  I stayed in a corner room which had a huge window overlooking downtown Chicago  The room was very large with a king bed pull out sofa couch desk and entertainment center  If you join Wyndham by Request they will give you a welcome gift as well as complimentary wireless internet access  The restroom was also huge with granite countertops and very nice soaps and shampoos etc  I really cant say anything but positive about my stay at this hotel including how convenient the hotel is to the magnificent mile just one block off of Michigan Ave  
P => Loved the Wyhdham Chicago After reading the negative reviews about this hotel I got nervous booking our room but let me tell you I am SO HAPPY that I didnt listen and we chose this hotel  My fiance and I stayed here for  nights  We flew in from NJ to go see the Bears game  We got to the hotel at pm and I know check in isnt till pm so I was a little nervous about checking in early but they gave us no problems what so ever  All the employees were very nice amp always said hello  The room was great  We got a room with two queen size beds which by the way were very comfortable  The comforter itself was to die for  I dont know about the reviews stating to much noise we never had a problem The location was perfect  Its with in walking distance to just about everything  Magnificent Mile is two blocks from the hotel  There are several bars restaurants  s and delis around as well  Valet parking tells you to call them  minutes in advance which was true on Saturday but every other day it only took   minutes  And weve stayed   several hotels in Chicago and thats pretty good  I am a referring travel agent with YTB and would recommend this hotel to any one of my clients  To book Cheap travel or to purchase your own travel website please visit my website      
P => Great effort We had a great stay at the hotel  The location was ideal and we used the Wyndham ByRequest option which customized and gave us an upgrade for our special trip  The best part of the stay was these extra touches including the Wyndham ByRequest personalized service  I also appreciated that I was able to get the best rate for the room via their own website vs  a travel site  I dont know that I would stay at this location again however since Id likely want to try a new hotel and theres no view and the pool is too small  Also the or was a little impersonal and could have more character  Also when it came time for checkout it was a bit past  and we couldnt use the online checkout which is frustrating  
P => Perfect I booked this hotel based on reviews I read and am so happy I did I spent  nights for a vacation trip to Chicago and had a wonderful time  This hotel is in the perfect location to walk or take public transportation to Michigan Ave shopping sites museums lake etc  The staff from the bellman to the front desk to the bartenders to the concierge desk was fantastic  All very personable helpful and knowledgable  My room was on the th floor quiet and the bed was so comfortable The food in the restaurantbar was very good though pricey  The hotel is located next to a Corner Bakery TGIFridays and very near Burrito Beach so I had lower cost food choices that were convenient  Id stay here again in a heartbeat 
P => Sweet Staying at places like Wyndham Renaissance and Hilton makes is so hard to go elsewhere Priceline accepted my bid and put me up for one Friday night at an unbeatable  rate  My early check in not arranged in advance was swift friendly and with a room as requested king bed  No view to speak of th floor if I recall but a wonderful bed with down comforter dozens of pillows and great mattress  Desk was too low but the Herman Miller chair made up for it  The usual nuisance of paying for Wifi at upscale hotels was a sure thing although there was a weak T Mobile hotspot signal around but it was too slow for VPN connections  Bathroom was all ble and big Nice showerhead and good water pressure  No noisy fan and no fog problems either  Pool area was inadequate Pool was about  x  ft which is small   especially when unmannered kids want to share it with you  Hot tub was great  Sauna wasnt on and steam room was out of order  Too bad I didnt eat at the hotel neither room service or restaurant  Fairly pricey as one would expect  Concierge was indeed helpful when I needed to do online check in for my flight  Would love to return here and now I know the building isnt nearly as scary as it looks on the website pictures  Really nice place definitely a competitor to Renaissance and Hard Rock  
P => Trickery  On our  week journey across the country we stayed at many many hotels Im writing from one now and were particularily excited about the Wyndham in Chicago as it was the quotfanciestquot hotel on the trip  Ill never stay there again or any other Wyndham In Chicago I usually stay at the Westin on Michigan Ave but the  room on the Wyndham website won me over and it looked very nice    BE PREPARED TO TIP A LOT I am a big tipper and this hotel bled me dry  Be sure to carry plenty of s because unless youre walking into the hotel with no car and no bags youll need them  When you pull up theres a valetbell guy who walks over to take your car and arrange for a bell hop   But he doesnt actually bring the bags up OR drive the car another guy pushes the cart to the room and unloads the bags  and when we left there was a third guy who brought the car so have at least  in s for everyone  It was weird  I lived in L A  for years and have stayed in  star hotels all over but this was a lot of people to tip   P S  its a  charge to bring a car for them to park in a  garage this too was unexpected  Ive never had the charge be that high  This next thing is why Ill never stay there or at any Wyndham property again  When I booked the  room I made sure to read all the different room descriptions and pick the one that read quotIn Room Internet Accessquot AS OPPOSED TO quotInternet access for a feequot rooms  When we got there and plugged in the laptop there was a prompt to pay   for hour access UNLESS you had the code  quotWe must have to call to get the codequot I said  The front desk disagreed  quotNo one gets complimentary internet herequot  I went downstairs to try and print out my reservation that would clear this up but even the computers in the Business Center needed a credit card swipe to work  The front desk wouldnt budge even after bringing up the info on their computers they argued that while the description  be misleading they never said quotFREEquot and they never said they wouldnt charge me     really Wyndham seriously The polite but frustrated argument went on for some time as I tried to convey that it was the misleading description and therefore my feelings of being tricked amp cheated and not the money  This man was polite but never made me feel better  I was a freak who was making a big deal over   and he didnt know what to tell me  I felt like tipping another  to get the hell out of there  He said they werent even making the   because they hired out the internet to a third party so I shouldnt be upset at them quotUhhhh Im pretty sure Wyndham made SOME meager millions of dollars profit in that deal so dont go therequot and dont get me started on the  parking profit  He went to check with a manager and came back still with the same position but offering to comp me breakfast or buy me an in room movie to quelch my  thirst its not about the  you idiot I took the free breakfast with no shame  That in fact was the lonely high note of the stay  The breakfast buffet was lovely and reflected the image Id had of the hotel  Nice spread perfect raspberries and polite people  Its imteresting that the buffet was  and while it was nice its wasnt an  breakfast buffet  Theyre overcharging for just about everything there  Id SO much rather be charged another   on the room rate and have quotfreequot internet access and breakfast included as well as parking Thatd be   they wouldnt have to pick at you for  No trickery needed  Wyndham lost me when they offered half the amenities of a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn at a higher cost with uppity attitudes   Like a few of the other reviewers I agree that the concierge was helpful and always there BUT I could find my own restaurant and metro stop if I had internet  The room wasnt as impressive as the Hampton Inn I stayed in the night before honestly  We asked for a view or an upgrade when we booked didnt get anything  The shower was tiny with low water pressure and if lower ranked hotels can buy the curved shower bars that keep the curtains from blowing against you why cant they ALSO I wasnt a big fan of check in and out being on the second floor  Why You have to walk up a big staircase or wait for an elevator to speak the front desk  
P => nice place Would definetly stay here again  Staff friendly check in took all of  seconds  Sent an email a week ahead and asked for any available upgrades since my wife and I were staying for our anniversary  Was upgraded on the house to the executive suite pretty nice and very large  Concierege was very helpful  Only draw back was facing Northwestern Memorial Hospital quite a few ambulances but slpet fine  One block off Michigan Ave  so very excellent location for shoppers close to red line for Cubs game and Navy Pier not too far either  Everything was clean no isues there at all  Parking was easy about  blocks south  for  hours  
P => Room about average location great We stayed here in y  and we found the hotel just about average  The front desk staff was wonderful Very friendly and helpful  Our room was OK but we could hear the people in the room next to us very clearly which was a little annoying especially late at night when they came in  The carpeting could use a cleaning because it was stained in a few places  We liked the location very much and that is a plus  We thought the price for parking was a little excessive so make sure you ask about that if you drive into Chicago  It takes a long time to get your car out so be sure to call at least  minutes ahead  
P => Smokyfor me too Second stay there   last year went for American Girl package  This year just went to visit the museums  Slightly worn hotel but the sheets and towels are clean and I like sleeping under the duvet as opposed to those horrible velour blankets in most hotels  Squeaking in the ceiling continous from AC unit like a cricket  I had ear plugs and it did not bother my dhter so we endured   the engineer could not seem to find what was wrong  Carpet in the room moderately stained this time around  And could see where they had scrubbed here and there  Had the maid in the hall wipe the room order menu off on our arrival as it had something hard and dry and non descript stuck on it  After the first night someone checked in near by who apparently disregarded the nonsmoking room policy  I am very sensitive to smoke and could smell it the last two mornings there  Very good location but pricey for the age and wear and tear  And yes I have an upper respiratory infection now  Probably no vaction trips for a while expensive and the flying is no fun  
P => Beware the Wyndham Reservations on St  Clair Street Three times to get reservations correct first through general reservations then twice speaking with local hotel reservation representative who was rude and had the attitude quotstay or notquot and kept changing the rate with each conversation  Never received proper confirmation via email  When arrived was given smoking room reserved NS and when room corrected ended up with  beds vs King as reserved months in advance  Beware  
P => Great Stay Just returned from a one night priceline stay at the Wyndham Chicago it was great The location is tremendous though only a block off of the Mag Mile it has a distinct cozy quotneighborhoodquot feel to it  There is a myriad of excellent dining shopping and entertainment choices within very easy short walking distance  Every staff member we encountered acted as if their job depended on how well the customer is treated  The room was smallish spotless and very quiet The bathroom very roomy and the bedding was fantastic  We could see the Emergency room entrance to the hospital out of our th floor window  but heard no sirens between the hour of pm am and nothing disturbed our sleep Weve had short stays at six different four  Priceline hotels in the LoopN Michigan areas of Chicago in the last three years and The Wyndham is our new   favorite  
P => Nice but dated Stayed there during a trade show a few weeks ago  Location is fantastic with easy walking access to restaurants shopping shows tourist attractions etc My room actually got upgraded twice to an executive suite  While that was a nice touch after a few errors during check in there were a few problems with the room  First it was dark and sparsely orated  Also there were lights burned out in the bathroom and a hole in the shower curtain   nothing major but little problems I feel like housekeeping should have noticed without me pointing it out  The rooms seemed to be in need of reorating  Also at a hotel this price it would be nice if internet access was included   I hate that I can get free internet access at a discount hotel but get nickeled and dimed at luxury hotels The staff was wonderful and very helpful  Concierge service was very knowledgeable and pulled strings to get us into a popular eating spot  They also sent appetizers to our table once there I would definitely stay here again for business but would not spend that type of money if travelling on my own dime  
P => Wyndham are become my first choice RECOMMENDED  Best deal via hotel website  The ByRequest program is one of the best in the industry and everyone should sign up  This property is showing some signs of age but good maintenance throughout  Checkin was fast and friendly even though it was  a m  Clerk noted rooms facing the hospital at lower floors might be a tad noiser  I was checked into a lower corner king Large corner king room in general good condition  Furniture a mid to classic for me most hotels moving to higher tech contemporary look King bed very comfortable  Lighting was good  Bathroom in good condition and well illuminated  I encountered no problems  At night traffic much lighter and quiet  Staff was very friendly during entire stay housekeeping particularly nice offering to clean room as I exited one morning for breakfast Property is  block off Michigan Ave easy walk to numerous restaurants  Small gym with window view of city adequate for most needs  Taxis always available across street at hospital Overall a very good stay and an excellent choice for a business or a tourist visit  
P => Great location We recently stayed at this hotel and we were very pleased with a number of features  The location of this hotel is very ideal only a block off Michigan Avenue at its most convenient location to the Water Tower the State Street restaurant area and Navy Pier a very walkable distance  We were offered an upgrade to a ior suite for a surprisingly low price the bed was very comfortable the bathrooms were spacious with a stand up shower and an underrated feature was a temperature controlled setting instead of the usual quotheatquot and quotcoolquot thermastat  The concierge desk although understaffed was VERY helpful and patient   which helped us in choices for restaurants tours bookings etc The one drawback was the price on the food for room service  It definately kept the menu book closed throughout the whole stay for us We typically look for that kind of thing when staying in a hotel but it was a big turnoff how high the prices were   especially considering its a    star hotel  Overall the staff was friendly rooms were very clean location just fantastic and we would definately stay here again  Especially for the price we got it 
P => Nice hotel could be a bargain Its a very nice hotel  Its book able through Priceline at times where it could be an amazing bargain  Centrally located a few blocks from Michigan Av  Magnificent mile easily walk able to Millenium Park Art Institute Grant Park Lincoln Park the Lake Shore and Navy Pier The beds were super comfy the staff were nice  There are some nice places to eat in the area lots of shopping no free WiFi though but I found few no Chicago hotel offered this  
P => Wyndham Chicago worth the deep discount We booked our one night stay at the Wyndham through a quotdeep discount site for  The hotel is beautiful  The location is one block away from the Mag Mile so youre in prime tourist location  The interior of the hotel is gorgeous  Our room was clean well orated  The bathroom was plain strangely laid out and didnt seem up to par for a hotel like the Wyndham more like a Holiday Inn bathroom honestly but the bed was incredibly comfortable and soft thread count   Our view was of    a big fat gray wall we think be they gave us a less desirable room because we booked through the deep discount site We thought the hotel was beautiful but for the listed price of this hotel around  on a weeknight it could have been WAY nicer  Internet cost extra day and parking was day  And dont even get me started on breakfast prices  Also the staff was less than cordial most of the time sometimes downright rude  For the listed price of the Wyndham I think you could do better  However if youre considering booking through a deep discount site like Hotwire or Priceline then I think its absolutely worth it pros beautiful hotel  nice interior well orated rooms comfy bedscons boringplainunexceptional bathrooms high fees for internet breakfast and parking cranky staff  
P => Its all about expectations     My husband and young son stayed at the Wyndham for one night last weekend for a family event in town  We were lucky to get a room there albeit at almost  as most of the hotels in the city were sold out  The hotel is extremely well located to Michigan Avenue which was the most important consideration for us Given the Wyndham is technically a  star hotel we werent expecting much but were pleasantly surprised  The rooms were very clean though the amenities were quotokquotnot luxurious but fine    linens pillows bed towels etc  The rooms were furnished with a coffee maker great for warming bottles though it was a bit awkwardly placed in the entertainment cabinet  We were on a high floor so we didnt experience any problems with noise Service was a bit spotty   the bellmen werent quick to collect our luggage or hail a cab etc  But the people behind the check in counter and in the restaurant were very friendly be thats just true of Chicagoans compared to New Yorkers and helpful  The buffet brunch in the restaurant was also quotokquot but a bit expensive  considering the quality  Next time well probably check out Corner Bakery which is just across the street If youre looking for a convenient clean place to put your head on a pillow in Chicago the Wyndham is a good choice  When the citys not fully booked the hotel is probably a good value too One tip we found the cheapest rate on the hotels own website more than   better than the best pre paid rate on Expedia  
P => Friendly Staff Comfortable One Night Stay Got a great price on this hotel through Priceline  The location for downtown Chicago was perfect the beds were very comfortable and I would definately stay here again  Im not sure Id call it a  Star hotel as far as luxurious and the amentities but it was very clean bathroom was a good size the staff was very friendly and helpful  I would definately stay here again  
P => Great Location comfortable bed We family with two children recently stayed in a suite American Girl Deluxe Package at the Wyndham Chicago  The location was great close to shopping the train and the lakefront running path  The suite was very large and the bed was amazing  My dhter loved the gifts that came with the American Girl package  I would highly recommend joining the free Wyndham By Request Club on their internet site  It gave us free Internet access regularly    day and they had welcome snacks cookies and milk for the kids and winecheesecrackers for the adults waiting for us on our arrival If you can request staying on the side of the hotel away from the hospital  We heard ambulances throughout the night  
P => Loved our stay I searched for days for the perfect hotel that met my criteria as faras location price room size and pool  I traveled with my husband and three teenage children to Chicago for a three day stay and could not find a suitable suite anywhere as I was booking late and it was spring break week  I read countless reviews and settled on the Wyndham ultimately because it seemed it would suit our needs    so we took a chance  And I was pleasantly surprised  I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world and I found this hotel perfectly fine  My children loved it I ended up trying to booktwo different types of rooms on the hotels web site through their web rates  I finally called the number listed for web rate information and she helped me get the rooms I wanted  We got a cornerking which I heartily recommend and a double room for the kids  The corner king was huge and had non rectangle dimensions almost like a triangle  We had windows that covered one entire wall facing the front of the hotel  Yes the sirens were constant but we got used to them after a while and they did die down by bedtime  They never woke me up and I am a light sleeper  The corner king room had a sofa bed as well which I wasnt expecting The bathroom was huge as well but a bit cold for me and no way to heat it up  The temperature in the main room was easy to adjust however  The room had a large entry way with a table and lamp and large closet  The tv was in the typical armoire with minibar and coffee set up  There was a nice desk and ergonomic desk chair and a coffee table in front of the sofa  Even with the sofabed pulled out the room was still spacious  We were very happy with our room  This room was large enough that the five of us could hang out withoutfeeling cramped then at bedtime the kids went to their own room which was just around the corner from ours  Their double double room was a little cramped but their bathroom was a nice size  Our beds were very comfortable  We did not use the restaurant as it was a bit pricey for a family of five  The bar was a very happening place the Monday night we arrived We also did not use the concierge for anything but they always greeted us as we walked by  The pool area was small but big enough for a nice swim and the gym was a nice amenity We ate breakfast at a place kitty corner to the hotel called Corner Bakery and there was a Fridays Restaurant a block away that the kids enjoyed  They also insisted on walking to Dunkin Donuts a block or so away  Michigan Avenue shopping is literally a short block away and that was the main reason I chose this hotel  We walked one evening to the Hancock Observatory not far away at all Parking was  a night and they add it to your final bill  We tried different ways of getting about  One time we left the hotel and then parked at the museums and that cost   The next day my husband thought hed save money by taking a cab to another museum but it was  each way  It would have been cheaper to take the car out of the garage  Next time well explore public transportation I liked havingthe car in the hotel lot but you cannot access it at whim  When we called for our car though it was there in minutes  Overall I really enjoyed this hotel and definitely would chose it again  We had no problems whatsoever and felt we got what we were looking for  
P => Meh The Wyndham Chicago My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham Chicago for  nights Fri Sun in ch   We paid night through       We found it to be a rather average hotel that neither amazed nor disappointed us  The staff was helpful but not really friendly  Our room was ent  It was clean and nicely orated  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were rather flat  Our room had a nice desk and chair as well as an additional recliner  The bathroom was fine no frills but nice enough  Several of the reviews on this site have mentioned outside noise as a problem the hotel is located across the street from Northwestern Hospital thus I requested a room on an upper floor away from the hospital side  I think I only woke up once from ambulance sirens as they seemed to taper off after about  pm  I m not sure if the room s location helped or not  We didn t try room service nor did we at the hotel s restaurant so I can t really comment on them POSITIVES The location only a block off of Michigan Ave  the hotel is in a prime area of town NEGATIVES Noise from the hospital No free internet   dayMY OVERALL IMPRESSION I would never pay full price for this hotel however I am satisfied with my stay and feel that I got my money s worth MY RECOMMENDATIONS  Request an upper floor room away from the hospital side of the hotel   Don t pay full price  
P => Great Hotel I stayed here with  children for  nights in ruary and we had a wonderful stay The room was reasonably sized doubles It had a big bathroom with great shower and was spotlessly clean All the staff were very friendly to both myself and my children and were very helpful in suggesting restaurants and places to go It is in a great location block to Michigan ave and you can get a bus to just about anywhere from there I would definitely stay here again 
P => th Time  Still Love the Wyndham My dhter and I have been staying at the Wyndham each winter for  years now with one interruption when we tried the Omni  The main thing that keeps us coming back is the lovely bedding and comfortable beds  Also the rooms are spacious and the location is great  We have stayed in a standard room a couple different suites and a corner king  I would recommend them all but in the corner king rooms be aware that the emergency room of Northwestern University Hospitals is right below you and you will hear ambulances in the night  bring along a noise maker and youll be fine  I have one minor complaint this year  for the first time they didnt leave me a little bottle of wine for being a quotBy Requestquot member and the formerly reasonable mini bar prices had jumped up to what you normally find in other hotels  I used to love that their mini bars had prices that encouraged you to buy from them rather than running down the block to White Hen  The staff is always very friendly and helpful  Well definitely be back next winter  
P => Nothing special We were really looking forward to staying at the Wyndham as weve always heard it is one of the better hotels in Chicago  And be it was our heightened expectations which have left us a bit disappointed in the overall stay  We got a really cheap rate for our room through Hotels com and as weve learned on previous trips that sometimes means you get the worst room in the place  Such was the case on this trip  We were the first room outside the elevators and our view consisted of a brick wall  The bed was not very comfortable and the pillows resembled half emtpy sacks of flour  The bathroom which was enormous had no place to hang anything up  A hook on the back of the door would have been nice  And when they tell you to call the valet for your car  minutes in advance believe them  
P =>   Excellent Hotel in the Windy City This Wyndham was wonderful  We arrived at am and our upgraded spotless JS was ready to go  Our ByRequest goodies were there and we were all set  The room was very large and it had a nice city view and we could even see the lake  The staff was wonderful friendly and very helpful  The hotel is on the second floor so you have to walk down a flight of stairs or take a short elevator ride to get to the ground floor  It is in a great location just a block from great shopping and a huge choice of places to eat  Try the Weber Grill for fun and a good meal  We spent four nights here and were very pleased with the accommodations and the hospitality  We have spent many nights checking out hotels and Wyndhams can be hit or miss this one was perfect  
P => good deal for suite after Christmas This was the second time staying at the Wyndham  The rate after xmas between new years was actually cheaper for a suite than a room which I stayed in e   Kudos to Russell the concierge who helped me by phone prior to my stay and continued to do so during my stay  He was super You cant beat the location of this hotel  I thought Corner Bakery was good for breakfast but actually liked West Egg  down the street and to the right for great eggs pancakes fruit at really affordable prices  The hotel restaurant is a bit on pricey side but ended up there for late lunch during the hordes of tourists after holidays  The pizzeria Due is really good in that they take your name and actually have the pizza out shortly after you sit down  Dont know if Unos does the same  
P => An Outstanding Hotel I stayed in the Wyndham Chicago for one night and was completely happy with every aspect of my stay  I was immediately greeted as I arrived and all of the staff were great  The hotel and room were both very clean and the food at the hotel restaurant was excellent  As I said the staff were very helpful and pleasant This hotel is also in a great location  This was my first stay in Chicago and it was nice to find out I was only a block or two from the Magnificent Mile I would definitely recommend this hotel 
P => Wyndham We recently stayed at the Wyndham for a family vacation to Chicago  The hotel is certainly geared for the businessconvention visitor with room service and resteraunt prices that were well outside our budget  Having said that the location is fantastic for exploring the Magnificent Mile  While the room was not particularly large for the four of us it was what I expected and was clean  There is a Corner Bakery straight across the road where we got our breakfast each day and Ginos East Pizza is only  blocks away deep dish heaven  The kids enjoyed the pool although it is quite small and I could imagine it filling up quickly in the summer  The staff were friendly and helpfu  Overall a good stay but not a hotel particularly aimed at families  
P => Great Hotel for the Price and Location We just stayed at the Wyndham Chicago great stay Booked through the hotel website for  and joined the Wyndham by request club definetely worth your time  Because we joined the club we were upgraded to a large suite and received a cheese tray and beverages in our room  Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  Short walk to Watertower shops  The only complaint they could use to update some furnishings and linens  We asked for an extra blanket and pillows they were delivered quickly but the blanket had stains and a hole  Other than that nice lounge and restaurant for breakfast  Will stay again  
P => Great Location BIG room We had a huge room it came in handy for four girls trying to get ready for a night out on the town  The staff was friendly cabs were ready and waiting and we got a wonderful price by booking on priceline com  The corner bakery is across the street and it offers a good inexpensive breakfast  
P => Great City Great Hotel Whilst staying with family in the chicago area we spent a night at this hotel whilst shopping the Magnificent Mile Its location is excellent one block from the magnificent mile and on public transport routes should you require The staff were extremely friendly from the check in staff to the domestic staff cleaning the rooms  The room was lovely and a really good size for a city centre hotel We booked a romance package which was good value and included sparkling wine and strawberries in our room as well as breakfast  The breakfast was however a little disappointing compared to other hotels we haved stayed at in the US  The choice was limited but of good quality The hotel is near a hospital but we only noticed when walking back in the evening and we didnt experience any disturbance from this Overall a great city a great hotel  We would definitely recommend it  
P => Nice Hotel Great Location We stayed in a corner king room for  on a Friday and Saturday night  Got the price from their website that same Friday we checked in  The king room was large and very pleasant  The heat in the room seemed to operate really slow we were cold upon checking in and it took a long time for the room to warm up but the rest of the weekend we were comfortable  The location is ideal one block away from Michigan Ave  but on a quieter street  The intersection where it is at has stop signs instead of a signal which gives it a quiet relaxed neighborhood feel  There is a hospital across the street on the north side but it didnt bother us  As the ambulances approach they turn of their sirens as they enter the hospital so you dont hear the constant wailing as an ambulance would pass by  We were on the th floor on the northeast corner facing the hospital  From this spot the only view was of other office towers across the street  We did not eat at the hotel restaurant but we did eat at the very good Corner Bakery across the corner and a good TGI Fridays half a block away toward Michigan Ave  We also ate at the California Pizza Kitchen  blocks away and went to the AMC  to the movies  Everything is convenient from this location  Quiet hotel away from main scene but still plenty close  Staff is very friendly and helpful  Nice relaxing hotel  
P => New Years celebration Very nice hotel   classy atmosphere however it was a bit pricey for what you actually get  Loved the lobby and the staff was very friendly and accomodating  The only thing negative we have to say is that the phone in the room didnt work the wake up call was late and the shades didnt open to let us see the view of the city  We would definentely stay here again but probably not on a holiday with the higher rates because for the price we could have found a nicer hotel  
P => nice but nothing special We stayed at the Wyndham just after Christmas for night through priceline com  It was a pleasant experience though nothing to write home about  The room was spacious and well appointed two armchairs writing desk with Aeron knockoff plush bed with cushions spacious bathroom with lots of towels with an unspectacular view  The room must have been just above the kitchen or soomething as it smelled of greasy bacon in the morning through the AC system which was quite unpleasant  We had breakfast at the Corner Bakery across the street which is run by a spectacularly nice manager  The room was not exactly the cleanest Ive ever seen carpet same holds for the bathroom toilet seat and Im glad I didnt book it through the hotels website for more than double the price  Its not a particularly stylish or interesting hotel by any stretch of interpretation but it is fine and very conveniently located  block East off Crate and Barrel on Mich  Avenue   also very close to the Hancock and some will relate to this information more than others to the American Girl Place   lots of children with dolls among the guests  The concierge gave us contradictory information on transportation to OHare Airport but it all worked out in the end  An interesting fact I had paid in advance and I wasnt supposed to see how much they charged priceline com for the room but they inadvertently slipped a notice under my door  Priceline had paid them  plus tax I found the fact that you had to take two elevators or walk up one flight of stairs and then take an elevator up to your room mildy annoying especially if youre loaded with shopping bags but for the price I wont complain  If I need a hotel near Mich  Avenue again and priceline sends me to the Wyndham again it will be fine but I wouldnt particularly SEEK to be placed in the Wyndham and if I was looking for a romantic getaway Id not put my money on the Wyndham  
P => Nice hotel  conveniently located  bit pricey Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here  It was a little high  but I booked late and the city was almost full so I understand why  The rooms were lovely and the front desk staff was very very nice  The upgraded my husband and me to a quotior suitequot because as the girl said she likes people from Texas and it was available  Thats never happened before Very clean nice ambience friendly considerate staff  The only weird thing is you enter on the ground level take the elevator up to the second floor and then you have to get on another elevator to get to the rooms  Security be but a little inconvenient  I would stay here again 
P => Great stay at the Wyndham Just returned from a  night stay attending a business seminar  Excellent service right from arrival  Very helpful and informed staff  Early check in allowed  No hassles  Comfortable clean rooms with nice views of the city skyline or Lake Michigan  Excellent meal at the Caliterra Restaurant with yummy tinis at the lounge  The luncheons provided for the seminar were also great  Ideal location for getting around the city  It was my first time in Chicago and I would definitely return and stay again at the Wyndham  
P => A great stay My dhter and I stayed at the Wyndham for  nights after attending a wedding in Madison Wisconsin  It was our first visit to Chicago  We loved the Wyndham  The lobby is lovely and the check in on the nd floor was no problem  We had no problem with the elevators hardly had to wait more than  seconds the whole time we were there  The rooms were very nicely furnished and the beds were very comfortable  The hotel is so convenient to the Magnificant Mile  We ate breakfast at the Corner Bakery every morning and loved it  Great selection of food  We found the hotel staff very friendly and courteous  The concierge lady was very nice and answered all my questions with no problems  We found everything very nice and clean  Our rooms were cleaned everyday and the whoe room was immaculate  We saw no problems with dirty carpets as noticed in other reviews on this hotel  We would definately stay at the Wyndham in the future as we loved Chicago and would love to come back again 
P => Some good some bad  Great location close to the Mile and restaurants with outside dining  The beds are very uncomfortable We booked a corner king room  huge windows very bright nice room    Wish the beds were better  
P => Made very welcome  We had planned to stay for four nights at the Wyndham in Chicago but terrorists in London had other ideas so we only managed to get there from London for the one  We also arrived minus our cases  When the staff heard this they gave my wife and two girls hair brushes shampoo and anything else they needed from the hotels gift shop  They were also very helpful in directing us to the local shops so we could buy some clothes  The hotel is in an excellent location for the city centre just off the Magnificent Mile  We were also within walking distance of Navy Peir  Our room was nice and clean with room enough for the four of us  We plan to revisit Chicago and would definetly stay here again  
P => Vert satisfied with Wyndham We were very happy staying at the Wyndham  My son and I travel to Chicago once a year to see the museums etc  We stayed at the Congress last year and for the extra money it costs to stay here it was totally worth it  Sara at the front desk check in was especially helpful  She made our stay at the Wydham exceptional  The pool was a great benefit for my twelve year old son and the jacuzzi steam room and sauna were great for me  We had a great view of the city from our th floor suite and we will be staying at the Wyndham again next year  Thanks again Sara 
P => Soured on an otherwise nice hotel by double billing  Booked the Wyndham on a very last minute bid via Priceline for approximately rd of the days going rate  The hotel is located just off Michigan Ave so youre close to the hustle and bustle without being right in it  Additionally Navy Pier is an easy walk to the SE of the hotel The hotel itself offers a nice first impression with an elegant if not stuffy lobby area  Check in was pleasant and easy  Despite being just by myself I was given two beds because thats all they had left  Fine enough as I figured that the  bed room would have more space  Sure enough the room was one of the bigger non suite rooms Ive seen in the city  The room had just about zero flair whatsoever but its quotunderstatedquot look worked well enough Beds were surprisingly springy in a good way and the Herman Miller chair at the workdesk was comfortable if shockingly expensive in the catalog in the room  The bathroom was quite nice with a large sink area and the toilet and shower tucked away a little further back Wasnt interested in anything on the room service menu   either in terms of price or content   so went to Corner Bakery which is a very nice restaurant if you like one of them know that its a chain and that theres more scattered around the city Elevators seemed slow upon arrival but things were a little more crowded at this point of the evening and a crowd gathered around the elevator and settled in for a rather long wait Upon return also noticed that theres surprisingly limited selection of cable channels here   mainly news  No MTV not a huge MTV fan but was surprised that it wasnt included Next morning I notice a charge on in the TV menu that is just about the same slightly less charge as my Priceline bid  I guess that be its what Priceline paid for the room  I ask at check out if there are any charges at all on the room  The person at check out looks me up confirms my name and room so theres no chance shes looking at the wrong person and tells me that there are absolutely no charges owed Three days later the same charge shows up on my bill  I call the hotel expecting that this will be taken care of in a professional prompt manner as it has been when its occured at other hotels in the city  Less than  seconds after the representative picked up shed already transfered me  No apology  Front desk where i was transferred to seemed annoyed interrupted me when I was trying to tell her the situation and transferred me to the managers message machine Furious   because its not my mistake and I dont want to be the one to have to spend my time trying to chase after them to fix it   I write Priceline and both call and write Wyndham Corporate who would do absolutely nothing besides forward a claim to the hotel and that let me know that it would take a ridiculous  business days for the hotel to investigate  Sure enough  business days go by norhings done and Im furious  Meanwhile Ive heard nothing from the hotel  After  business days I filed a chargeback and eventually the hotel refunded me but they never communicated with me at all about the refund   it just appeared I actually liked my stay at this hotel and was planning a return visit but the customer service I encountered after my stay was poor at best and changed my mind about being a Wyndham customer in the future  
P => Prepare to be nickle and dimed to death To put it simply this hotel is not a good deal for the business traveler  This hotel is for one incredibly overpriced for what you receive  Second while most hotels offer free wireless internet the Wyndham charges you   per day This is absurd I had no cellphone coverage here so I had to rely on their phone at   per local call  Additional problems I found included a wireless phone that did not work and the air conditioner did not cool the room adequately Overall this was a negative experience  Basically you will walk out of the Wyndham with a tremendous bill guaranteed to knock you over budget  In sum I regret staying at the Wyndham  I would recommend looking in the area for a better deal I m sure there are plenty  
P => Double Billed The hotel is in a great location with a wonderful bakery across the street for breakfast  Friends and I go to Chicago Christmas shopping each year and we loved the hotel itself along with the location  However once we got home my friend was billed after I had already paid for the room on my credit card  I noticed another person who wrote a review was also double billed  I was going to book our rooms for the Wyndam once again but after reading that persons review it is obviously a problem they need to deal with  It took months and many phone calls to get the room off of my friends credit card  I will seek a hotel elsewhere near the Magnificent Mile 
P => Quite nice  First the good  The lobby was very pretty and check in was a breeze  Our room was very nice with  double beds one for my husband and myself the other for our  sons  The linens on the beds we fantastic I thought  The carpet was a bit worn but it IS a high traffic hotel after all  The location was great  We paid the  to have our vehicle parked for the day and were able to walk from there to Navy Pier and the Mag Mile  Check out was easy and fast as well  DO join the Wyndham preferred members club   we were greeted in our room by a small bottle of wine for us and some juice for the children as well as cheese crackers and bottled water  A very nice touch I thought  I also found the staff to be quite helpful and friendly  The view as others have noted is not great   you do basically just see the surrounding buildings The only really quotbadquot point I can think of is the pool  It is very very small  But really I dont go to Chicago to sit in a pool so I didnt think it was a huge drawback Overall we enjoyed our stay and would go back 
P => Great location good hotel We stayed at the Wyndham for  nights and would rate it a low quotquot  The location is great  Its about midway between the river and water tower and one block off the magnificent mile  THerefore its close to a wide range of restaurants etc  We found the workers friendly  The quotextraquot elevator to the second floor lobby did not bother us at all  In fact both the Hyatt Regency and Peninsula and probably many others are designed this way  The rooms are clean bathrooms large and beds comfortable So whats not to like The rooms could be a bit larger the towels a bit thicker etc  As some have mentioned the rugs were stained its time to replace them  We were there at a very busy time  If we had paid   we would have been disappointed  We paid about  of that and given the high demand for hotel rooms we thought we received good value  In sumy we would certainly be willing to stay there again but would probably look elsewhere first  
P => Nice room We stayed at the Wyndham for  days  The room was nice clean and large  Join the free preferred club bc when you check in they will have your free request waiting for you in your room  We had Amstel light and cheese amp crackers  Nice bar and dining roomwe did not eat there but it looked like a great place for a drink  Parking is expensive but the valet service is very quick and friendly  The location is great right off Michigan ave  
P => Avoid the th Floor First the bad   If you are a non smoker avoid the th floor  If you cannot stay anywhere else in the hotel BUT the th floor ask for room  or any room right next to it  Why   of the floor smells like smoke from the moment you get off the elevator  With a little digging I found out why  All of the rooms are smoke free EXCEPT FOR ONE room    and a man has lived there for a year  He is obviously a chain smoker because it smells like an ashtraymobile home trailerwhite trash bar almost everywhere  The staff were kind enough to move me but I still had to walk through that crap   The pool is tiny  Its about the size of the small rooms  The restaurant downstairs is not particularly exceptional but it is exceptionally overpriced  Breakfast for four cost   Save your money and walk a few blocks to the Corner Cafe  I have the money to burn but most people dont  The place has good service but it is understaffed  During checkout time there were not enough bellmen to grab my bags so I had to bring them down myself  Not an easy task with an infant   There are no views of anything except the walls of other buildings  So if views are your thing youll need to stay elsewhere  Its nearly  PER  hour period to use the internet  This should be a courtesy Now the good  The staff although minimal were extremely friendly greeted me with a smile and the service was prompt for the most part in terms of concierge and desk reception  I believe had I requested to move to another floor they would have accomodated me  They provided lots of apples at the front desk  There is a GREAT whirlpool sauna excercise room and steamroom  The water pressure is in working order  The rooms were VERY clean and VERY nice  No complaints  If you like shopping the location is ideal  Its two very short blocks from the Magnificent Mile  minute run to the beach trail and a  min walk to the subway  As a runner I would stay here again but on a different non smokey floor   
P => Fancy hotel Great location We got the Wyndham from priceline for under   We felt that this hotel was super  Our room was on the th floor with a ent view of Lake Michigan  The room was very nice very clean and ent size  The bathroom at the Wyndham was the best we had been in  I would have rated it excellent but the layout on the first and second floors are pitiful  With check in on the nd floor Some of the staff were stuffy while others were very nice  Also I noticed that in picture of the hotel on the website you cant see that it is almost totally surrounded by other buildings so you definately can have some bad views out the windows  Hospital located across the street from the hotel but I did not hear a thing all night  We parked a block away in a parking garage for   Pool was a little small  
P => Problem double billing I had to check in under a private credit card due to the quothost companyquot being late  The host company along with myself corrected the card to the quothost companyquot a couple days later or so we thought  After returning home I get the bill and guess what quotthe host company did tooquot I hate spending my time unscrewing other peoples screwups and will remember this experience  It been almost two months and the problem still is not resolved and I am spend more time and long distance phone calls without success Kurt Watson 
P => A coorporate dormitory with all the charm of a boarding school    The Wyndham Chicago is not user friendly  The architect should be ashamed of its clumsy design  It is located in the heart of the Northwestern U  medical complex which perhaps explains this hotels purpose  A visit starts with struggling with luggage through the awkward revolving front doors searching for the reception area without any assistance from the preoccupied bellman and then taking an elevator to the second floor check in  This leaves you with an irritating first impression but check in is quick and friendly  A second elevator takes you to spacious rooms adequately furnished with a plush king bed  But the grim view from the east side rooms is of a stark concrete wall  Depressing  Internet access was    The th floor pool was small  and crowded with children  There is an adequate hot tub and basic exercise facilities  This hotel is best suited for those visiting Northwestern Hospital  There are far better choices in the area  
P => Just Awful     Avoid It I thought that by booking a four star hotel with a name like Wyndham that we could be getting a great hotel room for Memorial Day Weekend  I was very mistaken  We arrived at the hotel at  on Sunday afternoon and were told as were several others that there were no clean rooms available  For a hotel with a checkout time of  this is completely unbelievable   especially on a busy holiday weekend  We were told we would be called when a room became available    the call never came  After visiting some Chicago sites on a very hot Chicago afternoon we returned to the hotel at  and were told there were still not rooms available  After making it clear that we were not happy two rooms suddenly became available  We were told that the Romanian Soccer Team was there and was not leaving their rooms and this is why there were no clean rooms available  We entered a clean room but quickly found out that the air conditioning system did not work very well   not a good thing for a weekend with high temps above   The icing on the cake was when a few items went missing from the room a room that we only left and reentered once during the course of the night  Other minuses to this hotel include room service dishes left out the hallways for hours and incredibly long  minute wait times for the elevators and when the elevator arrived it was usually jam packed  Most of the staff we dealt with were very pleasant and I understand it was circumstances beyond their control but I have my choice of many hotels in Chicago and I can say I will never return to the Wyndham Chicago and highly discourage anyone else from doing so either  
P => Great Location really nice hotel Great hotel very cool location  One block away from Michigan Avenue  blocks walk from the Apple Store the flagship Crate amp Barrel etc  There is a restaurant across the street on the corner to get a good breakfast or lunch at  There is a TGI Fridays a few steps away  I really liked this hotel a lot  The only drawback is you have to take  elevators to get to your room  Otherwise it is  stars  
P => Wonderful experience Stayed here for a conference for four days found the price to be only a little above lesser quality hotels in the area   Admittedly did not spend lots of time in the room but the amenities were wonderful  I had done some research on this website for the best roomview and was easily given what I asked for when I checked in  Room was good sized the bathroom was just gigantic some friends actually said it could be considered a waste of space the view was as hoped for the service exactly what I needed and asked for and the bed as warm and inviting as I hoped  There was enough desk space to prepare what I needed a very nice office chair and then a nice relaxing stuffed armchair to unwind in  I had chosen this hotel because a family member ided to have their wedding here and I had such a good time I thought it was worth trying out as a guest  I was not disappointed and would gladly come back in the future  
P => Avoid Poor service and some maintenance problems  The room service menus are outdated and contain many items both food and wine that the hotel no longer serves  One of the phones in my room does not work not what you expect in a  a night room  There are many better choices in Chicago  
P => Will return Great views and a great staff  The room was very nice the bath was big the beds were nice with extra linens in the closet  Playstation and in room movies were a big plus  The only complaint is the noise its located across the street from northwestern memorial hospital and the noise outside is very loud  Still better than a lot of the more expensive hotels this close to michigan ave  
P => Great Location Average Hotel Nothing over the top for a  star hotel  I was very disappointed in the staff  The man who checked us in was very courteous and helpful  The others   we could have done without especially the bellhop who waited around for a tip when it took him  minutes to get our bags  The room was nothing special although we did love the hypoallergenic pack in the closet for those of you who are allergic to the down  The rooms definitely arent soundproof as we could clearly hear the conversation next door to us through the connecting door which was not ajar  The carpet in our room looked stained and old and the or especially the lighting seemed dreary and behind the times  Definitely dont think this hotel is worth the night we ended up paying  Should have booked again with Embassy Suites The location is perfect though  Youre a block from Michigan Ave  and all the shopping  
P => Ok   but there are better ones for the price We stayed in   in order to miss the expensive Christmas season  Staff Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  I lost my credit card at the hotel and did not notice until I received a call from the front desk  In fact they called the room numerous times to let me know they had it  If you need anything the concierge will be able to handle it all Food Breakfast was great get there early and enjoy the buffet  Excellent view and very quiet  Location Great right off Michigan Ave  Also be sure to stop by the Dunkin Doughnuts in front of the hotel Rooms This is the big draw back  Room was very dark and very loud because it overlooks the emergency room  I also requested a suite but it was not worth it  
P => Good value close to  shopping mile  The hotel is basically a typical big city business oriented hotel    however you can get good deals there if you look around  The rooms are modern spacious and well appointed theres a free but basic gym and the hotel is a block from the middle of the main shopping area in Chicago  
P => What the heck happened here This was our third stay here and Im pretty sure it will be our last no matter how cheap it is  The service has gone way way down  There was only one person checking in a line of people and even though others asked for a manager none ever showed  A friend tried calling us and it took him  times to actually get someone to answer the phone  When he got an answer she said she was at the front desk and put him on hold for almost ten minutes  Now this wasnt at am either it was in the middle of the day on a Tuesday How can you run a hotel and not have an operator We used to love to talk to a blond concierge there who always had the greatest restaurant reviews and a fun personality  She left and what they have in her place is a surly young girl who suggested the Grand Lux cafe as an alternative when we couldnt get into Joes Stone Crab  Thats comparable Lets not forget the guy who fidgets and seems to be speeding along there too  The great toiletries have been replaced by cheap stuff but they did replace the filthy carpet in the lobby though  
P => Nice property but could be better This is an attractive property one block off Michigan Ave near Neiman cus and Crate and Barrel  The quotBy Requestquot program is not bad choice of beverage and snack waiting in room and you can specify room attributes  The room was a little worn but okay  Nice bathroom though  Good breakfast buffet in the morning  People with smoke allergies I was on the th floor and the the stench of smoke was noticeable from lower floors  Valet parking always expensive in Chicago but this hotels is some of the priciest      Auto Show in full swing during my stay so hotel booked up too  
P => okay for the price Our stay at the Wyndham was a good value for   The people at the front desk and concierge were nice enough but any type of room service was below average  First it took them  minutes and three phone calls to bring up toothpaste  Second my husband submitted his suit for drycleaning before am for same day dry cleaning ie by pm  We had to call twice before they delivered it once at pm and again at pm  Other than that room was clean and location was okay  walkable but not with suitcases or bad weather  
P => Average Hotel Good value We stayed at the Wyndham for a night around Christmas  A great location for shopping and close to many restaraunts  I had heard good things about the Wyndham ByRequest program but was underwhelmed  Our quotwelcome amenityquot of cheese and wine was delivered sometime after dinner and our advance requests for extra towels and a local newspaper were not fulfilled  There was no express check in  Other than our expectations of the ByRequest program our stay was very nice and comfortable  The kids loved the pool and the fitness room was more than adequate  Booking through the Wyndham website we secured a weekday rate of  which I thought was a great value for a nice room in downtown Chicago  I would consider the Wyndham again for a downtown stay if I could get the same price  
P => Wyndham during the holidays We had an excellent stay the week before Christmas  The weather was so very cold but there was always excitement in the lobby as groups of ladies shopped and families bundled up to go outside and experience the Mag Mile  The location to Michigan Avenue was just a block right in the middle of shopping and the turn street was located at the corner of the huge Crate and Barrel on Michigan  We used the concierge a lot and they were always helpful in suggesting unique non chain restaurants for all meals   a big plus for us  It was a bit far to walk to Navy Pier in the cold but definitely do able  The nearby West Egg Cafe was great for breakfast and the restaurant Volare was good for dinner  This is great for families couples and anyone else who wants to explore this part of Chicago  
P => loved the Wyndham my husband and i have just returned from a  night stay at the wyndham from the moment we set foot in the hotel we were treated wonderfully  The hotel was clean the rooms very spacious we were on the th floor but very rarely did we experiance any noise from the hospital  I recomend the corner bakery for breakfast  I am a fan of new york at christmas time and was a little reluctant to book for chicargo but i would definatly go back and stay at the wyndham 
P => Perfect Location Great Hotel We came to Chicago for a group shopping trip  You cannot ask for a better location  There are many shops and restaurants located on the same street and the Magnificent Mile is probably about a minute walk  Ginos East famous Chicago deep dish is about  blocks away win walking distance as well as soo many other places  As for the hotel the staff was very friendly the place was gorgeous and the rooms were spacious and clean  The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were huge gorgous granite countertops with tons of space beautiful tile showers and even a phone in the bathroom The fitness room was also nice and quite large  The pool area is rather small and although I did not use it myself some of my fellow travellers did and they did say that both the pool and the jacuzzi seemed a little on the dirty side  There were also some nice restaurants on site  For breakfast there is a Dunkin Donuts and a McDonalds win walking distance as well as The Corner Bakery directly across from the hotel which has a pretty ent breakfast lunch and dinner menu at affordable prices  We had breakfast there twice you can get anything from bagelsbreakfast pastries to small breakfast platters or breakfast sandwiches available for dine in or to go hint if you get your order to go you will get it right away but if you tell them you are dining in you will sit at your table w a number and wait for them to deliver it to you I had to wait about  min for a toasted bagel one time  I would stay here again without a doubt and for the rate we got of night it was well worth it 
P => Wonderful and beautiful hotel Just returned from a one night Saturday night stay at the Wyndham in downtown Chicago   had a wonderful time our room was incredibly spacious HUGE bathrooms the bed was perfect and the view was great  We were on the th floor and had no complaints whatsoever Check in was very efficient and the woman at the desk was very friendly and energetic   express check out was a nice touch too  Very clean lobby and hallways very quiet hotel  We got the military discount rate so that was a plus Parking is expensive  per night but that is pretty much the norm in downtown chicago  Great location one block off Michigan Avenue and shopping galore  Would definitely recommend this hotel   look for travel special discount rates especially if you are a governmentmilitary person 
P => Great Location and Great Hotel Weve been to Chicage nearly a dozen times in last few years and have stayed at Omni riott and wanting to save  and stay out of the Mag Mile big mistake at Days Inn in Linclon Park   The Wyndham is by far the best place weve stayed They make you feel welcome do the best they can to accomadate your needs  Though youre right off the Mag Mile you still get a touch of a neighborhood  The Hospital noise is rare and compared to the traffic on Michigan Ave its actually quiet 
P => Nice Stay Stayed at the Wyndham Downtown for three nights in tember  Room was on the th floor and never heard much ambulance noise that other guests have mentioned  Nice room with a bit of a view of the lake and Navy Pier  For breakfast we visited the Corner Bakery just opposite the hotel it was never too busy  Overall would recommend the hotel we plan to stay there again next year  
P => Very pleased with the Wyndham I chose the Wyndham because of the reviews on this site and the excellent price less than night  I also enrolled in the ByRequest program for Wyndham visitors which provides some upgrades like free wireless networking a welcome beverage and snack etc  The hotel location is great as it is  block from the Magnificent Mile and across the street from the hospital  The rooms were very quiet   I never heard my neighbors or any street traffic  I would stay there again  
P => Great time in Chicago at the Wyndham Great deal for the price and location  Went for the American Girl package for my dhters sixth bday  The hotel has a wonderful American Girl package but you have to call them and book via phone vs on line  Book early if going in the spring Chicago is busy  The hotel gives away a free robe and slippers for your doll  Too cute  Great location and clean hotel  
P => Quite nice Nothing to complain about at all  The room was big clean and everything worked  Check in was simple and friendly and check out was super fast   short block to North Michigan and an easy walk into the Loop or Navy Pier  Corner Bakery across the street was really convenient and tasty  Being Chicago theres a Walgreens within a block or two of everywhere 
P => Wyndham is in the heart of it all My husband and I live in the Chicago suburbs and wanted a quick getaway  We are very familiar with the city and knew where to stay  This is really in the heart of all the excitement Magnificent Mile Navy Pier Oak Street Beach Great room and nice hotel restaurant  The pool was disappointing though not meant for couples   really suited for kids because it was so small and very crowded  I would stay there again and highly recommend it  
P => Great Hotel My husband  girls and I stayed at the Wyndham y   y  The hotel is very nice extremely clean and all employees were very courteous  Our room was great  We upgraded to the suite  pull out sofa for kids we had plenty of room for us   The bathroom was above average size and very clean also The location could not be better  One block off of Michigan ave  And a short walk to the Navy Pier  Room service was good the corner bakery just outside the hotel is great for breakfast or lunch  The only downside was our room was very near the emergency room of the hospital next door  We overlooked the nightly sirens though and they did not bother us too much We had a perfect stay and would go back if the opportunity comes up again  
P => Wyndham is a great hotel Being a long time fan of Wyndham hotels I ided to stay at the Wyndham Downtown Chicago on a recent visit to Chicago I booked online on Tuesday afternoon for a room on Friday evening  Friday morning before I left I found a better rate on Wyndhams website and they were happy to give me the better of the two  I ended up getting a suite for less than I was going to pay for a corner king Upon arrival I was greeted in the prompt professional way I always have been at Wyndham hotels  I checked in and was on the elevator to my room in under  minutes When I reached my room my byrequest amenity was waiting for me  Cheese and merlot as well as extra bottled water and orange juice The suite was larger than most apartments in my area  The bathroom was huge and spotless  The master bedroom was nicely done and the double sheeting of the comforter which was been a tradition in better hotels in Europe for ades was perfect for the season  It wasnt too heavy which was great because of the outside temperature being over  degrees  After relaxing we left to see our show stopping by the concierge desk to ask for a dinner recommendation  The nice lady told us about a bistro  blocks from the hotel called Bi   or something of that nature that served until am  A problem with being in quotlivelyquot downtown Chicago is that most of the restaurants stop serving around   Yeah what a nightlife The next morning we had breakfast which was better than average and left to head home  The staff was friendly and helpful each time I had a request or inquiry  I will be staying at the Wyndham on my next visit to Chicago 
P => Good Value Found the Wyndham hotel and staff very satisfactory  The staff was friendly courteous and professional  The room itself was nice  Real comfortable beds amp bedding  Very good location  
P => Great Hotel Perfect Location My husband and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend  We live in the suburbs just outside of Chicago but stay in the city every once in a while  The location was fantastic    within walking distance to Navy Pier and just one block from Michigan Ave shop to your hearts desire  We were also within walking distance to the Readhead Piano Bar a great low key piano bar and a nearby diner for breakfast  The room itself was great  We got a corner room  Everything was clean and very nice  VERY comfortable beds and pillows   one of the best nights sleep Ive ever had in a hotel  We heard the sirens a few times but they by no means bothered us  We parked in a structure about a block away  ouch but thats normal for Chicago and the fact that we could walk or take a short cab ride to anything we needed made it a great deal for this hotel  
P => Great location but      absolutely wonderful location just a block from michigan avenue  the hotel itself is a nice looking building  unfortunately the staff were very disappointing  i dont think i saw one employee smile the whole time i was there  the room had a nail sticking out of one of the door hinges and some faded graffiti that someone had obviously tried to clean and not done a very good job  i would definitely expect better considering the price of the place  
P => Fantastic hotel We loved our stay here the service was great the room was large clean and had a great view  The hotel is located just one block from the Magnificent Mile with all the premium shops you could ever want  It was also just a short walk from the Navy Pier and the John Hancock building  The loop is about  minutes walk from the hotel We joined the Wyndham By Request loyalty service before we booked its free and I think we were upgraded as a result and were given a room on the top floor th of the hotel We would both recommend this hotel very highly  But whatever you do dont visit the T G I Fridays restaurant next to the hotel 
P => They really helped me out    After the Chicago riott had quotlostquot my reservation and only permitted me to stay one night for my conference as they were sold out for the remainder the Wyndham really came to the rescue  They could not do enough for me and I found their staff extremely pleasant  The bardining room while a wee bit expensive served tasty food and great drinks  My only two complaints were that I am a member of their quotclubquot which provides for certain amenities none of which I received  Need my morning paper and when it wasnt there I finally said something   nicely and the manager apologized profusely  Lastly the hotel is directly across from Northwestern Medical Center   try to get a room in the back of the hotel so you dont hear sirens all night  
P => The Wyndham Chicago is just ok We booked this hotel based on the fabulous reviews it got    if you are looking for strictly location   book the Wyndham Chicago  We couldnt have asked for a better spot  We walked out the front door of the hotel and found fantastic shopping restaurants   you name it On the other hand everything else about the hotel is just ok  The staff are not particularly friendly   with the exception of the concierge and we were given a crib for our little one that didnt even have a proper crib sheet   they simply folded a full sheet and placed it on top of the mattress If we were at the Holiday Inn I wouldnt even mention it  Wyndham can do better  
P => Nice Location   ent Hotel Ive stayed at this hotel on two different occasions  Each time the staff has been accomodating and the room a one bedroom suite on each occasion fine  Ive stayed at the Embassy Suites down the street which is also a good choice and the Doubletree on Delaware as well as a Courtyard near the loop and the Palmer House Hilton  For my money the Wyndham booking on the internet with an internet rate has offered the best combination of location value for the dollar and service My only complaint would be that the rooms are much too dark  Lighting is low and they are orated in dark colors  Of course this means some dirt doesnt get spotted by the housekeeping staff but my rooms have been as clean as any of the full service hotels that Ive stayed at in Chicago  None of them have been perfect I have a low tolerance for dirt but theyve been acceptable  If you drive understand that they charge you  to park your car  You can self park for less at the lot by the Embassy Suites a couple of blocks away if youre so inclined  The pool area is older but nicely maintained  The gym is nothing spectacular but its much better than those at competing hotels in the area  As for the location for the leisure traveler its great  Navy Pier and the lakeshore are within walking distance and Michigan Avenue is only two blocks from your front door  There are also many good restaurants at all price points within two to three blocks of the hotel  Although with so many good choices in Chicago Id recommend investing in a cab and venturing out While its not up to the level of a Four Seasons or a similar luxury propertyall in all I think most people would be happy at the Wyndham  Its a nice moderately priced hotel  
P => Loved the Windham My dhter and I stayed here last week and we couldnt more agree with all the positive reviews  It is a great location for all the shopping on Mich  Ave  The hotel itself was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful  We were in the bar one night and mentioned wanting to get info on Jazz amp Blues clubs next thing I knew Jorge the bartender came back with a list from the concierge  The Corner Bakery across the street was a bonus great eat amp run breakfasts  We wont hesitate to go back  
P => A Good Choice Booked online and got excellent rate for corner room  Beautiful hotel with great location  block off Michigan Ave  Bellman gladly loaned us umbrellas  Good amenities  Id stay here again  
P => Loved it Perfect Location I use this site all of the time wanted to share my experience  Stayed at Wyndham first week in uary  First of all PERFECT LOCATION Everything within walking distance or short cab ride  Breakfast right across the street Corner Bakery Ice Cream and Doughnuts  block away Baskin Robbins amp Dunkin Donuts open hrs  for the late night munchies  Pizzeria uno or Due short walk which is a MUST The hotel had great service extremely comfortable beds clean pretty ETCgt The hotel bar is GORGEOUS with a great view  Very laid back and comfy with big velvet couches and chairs to relax in  A great place to have a b dinner drink  I Read about the closeness of the hospital and the noise of emergency vehicles all night  That was not a problem for us  We heard it once or twice in the morning and really was not a problem  I would stay here again in a HEART BEAT 
P => Great location   wonderful stay Just returned from a few days at this hotel  Our first trip to Chicago We chose this Hotel based on the trip advisor reviews and were not disappointed  Overall we had a wonderful stay and kept commenting on how friendly everyone was wherever we went in the cityIt is v  centrally located a block off of Michigan Ave  The service and accomodations are great for the price  Very simliar to other Wyndham Properies we have stayed at in Boston amp Phoenix Arizona so we knew what to expect or wise etc  Join the Wyndham ByRequest for some free welcome gifts drinkfruit  Yes true the pool amp hot tub are very small but there were only a handful of people there at the time so it made having a quick dip fun   the small sauna was also very relaxing after a long day As another reviewer suggested we bypassed the taxishuttle bus options and took the CTA Chicago subway from Midway to the Chicago stop on the redline and then walked  mins to the Hotel  I think it was just   each way v   or so we would have paid for a taxi each way  The CTA was suprisingly easy to use  It took us about  mins from the Hotel door to Midway Airport on our way home  Loved the close proximity of the Hotel to the Corner Bakery TGI Fridays amp the beautiful must see     Grand Lux Cafe The food was delicious  We would stay at the Wyndham Chicago again  
P => Wonderful Stay and would return The hotel is a block off of Michigan Ave on Erie St  The service and accomodations are wonderful for the price  The entrance is very grand with the second floor check in  Loved the Corner Bakery and TGI Fridays across the street and down the block  Join the Wyndham ByRequest and get the free stuff  You have the chance of a upgrade of the hotel isnt booked and full like it was on our weekend  Take the Trolley tour if time allows  Avoid the cabs and transients because the will bring down your trip  It amazes me that Chicago doesnt do something abou them walking there cornerstone shopping area  The cleaness and streets are nothing like New York on how clean New York is  
P => Pleasantly surprised My husband dhter and I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago  I booked our stay with the Wyndham after reading several favorable reviews on this site  I also believed that quotyou couldnt go wrongquot with a Wyndham hotel  We were very pleasantly surprised when we checked in to find that we had been upgraded to a quotior suitequot  I had joined quotBy requestquot at the suggestion of this site when I booked the trip  That is one of the percs   free upgrades  The room was very large and clean with a king bed and queen sofa bed  The bathroom was extremely large also and when we called down to the front desk for extra towels and an extra blanket there was someone at our door within  minutes  The people were very friendly and the hotel was very convenient  We were able to walk to Michigan Ave Water Tower Place and even Navy Pier  We will definately stay there again when we return in the warmer weather  
P => Nice Hotel Great Guest Program Great location right off Michigan Ave  If you find a better rate on another booking site which they can check they will match the price and give you the first night free  I found a better price at          and they matched it and gave us our first night free  We should have booked online but I did thru the reservation center so do it online for the free breakfast coupon  We were already members of Wyndham by request so we were upgraded to a corner king room which was very nice but the carpet was a little spotty  And the lighting is all lamps so its not very bright in the evening  The large bathroom was wonderful  We were welcomed with our choice of mixed fancy nuts and water and pop  What a nice treat  Parking is  a night with ins amp outs  We parked there but the next time we will use the garage across the street its only  and you can have access to your car without calling the valet we did not know were there car was parked as the garage was not onsite You do have to use two different elevators to get to the guest rooms but the beautiful orations and views it was not a problem  The check in is on the second floor as the valet desk is on the first floors This is our th hotel we have stayed in and we will go back they were the best for someone on a budget if you book with them direct the upgrades and Wyndham by request treats are well worth it  They do not give WBR to people who book with any other site so book with them for the best deal or ask them to match it as we did for a great deal  The corner king was  a night we booked a king for  on their site and they matched the  we got at beststay plus the  service charge and gave us the first night free since we had booked  days  So we paid   plus the  a night parking  What a great deal  I took the printout from the emails and its a good thing I did I needed it for my free night as the hotel billed me for both nights but they corrected it with a copy of the email saying my request to match the lower price was honored  We walked to Dicks Last Resort for lunch and Giordios for pizza for dinner  There is a Dunkin donuts and a Burritto Beach and subway and chinese all within walking distance too  Great hotel great prices if you book with them direct 
P => Central location a fail safe hotel I was suprised to see the mixed reviews for this hotel we stayed here for  nights and found the rooms to be clean and well presented the food above average and the staff friendly The hotel is not the best in the world but it certainly is a long way from the worst Its central location is a big plus and if you are looking for a fail safe hotel that offers mid range accommadation at mid range prices this hotel is for you I was tempted to rate the hotel as average but it is better than that and the location deserves  star alone very central  
P => Loved the Wyndham This site was very helpful in planning my recent trip to Chicago and I just wanted to reciprocate and provide some additional info about the Wyndham  Despite the fact that I think I was the only person who didnt get an upgraded room lol I have only positive feedback about the hotel  The location just off the Magnificent Mile was excellent and concierge was very helpful in providing info about bus routes etc  I did join Wyndham by request and would recommend doing so and the welcome snack was a nice treat  In making my reservation on the hotels site I was also able to print out a coupon for a free breakfast  Very nice buffet but had breakfast the rest of the time at the place across the street  One additional nice touch was that the business center had free computers you could use to access the internet  Would definitely stay there the next time Im in Chicago  
P => Very Excellent accomidations My partner and I just returned from a weekend getaway in Chicago  We were very pleased with our stay  The location was great and the service was very consistant The hotel was very clean and conviently located off of Michigan Ave  We will defenitely stay here again  
P => Excellent Location The location of the Wyndham Chicago was excellent  One block from Michigan Ave  or Magnifficient Mile  minutes walking distance from Navy Pier  The room was very clean and very spacious including the bathroom  Because the hotel is in front of a hospital sirens are heard during day and night  The only problem we had was with the air conditioner  It has movement sensor and it turns off automatically but it was turning off even though we were in the room and were not sleeping  Also during the night sleep we felt sweating  Well we turned it on again and get used to it  
P => Very Enjoyable Stay We spent two nights at the Wyndham and enjoyed it very much  The location is great and close to shopping and restaurants  The staff was friendly and very helpful  Will definitely stay there again  On a side note its about a  minute walk to Navy Pier  We walked down St  Clair to Ohio St  Ohio street has a pedestrian underpass that goes under Lake Shore Dr  and when you get to the other side you are in the park  Navy Pier is right there  
P => Disappointed The location of the hotel is great  Its close to shopping as well as other attractions  Was extremely disappointed in the service in every department from the front desk to the valet parking  I arrived one hour prior to the posted check in time and expected that my room would not be ready  The clerk at the front desk took all my information and had me fill out a registration card  He asked me to return one hour later for my room key  I returned and was told that none of my registration information had been posted and had to go through the entire process again as well as wait an additional  minutes for the room  The room was clean with the exception of the bedspread on one bed which was filthy and soiled the sheets  I would not stay in this hotel again  
P => Loved the Wyndham Amazing size suite  Huge queen sized bed in one room and an enormous sitting room in the other  Plumbing worked st for me at a US hotel  Paid for the Internet saved finding somewhere bit complicated using the keyboard with no mouse  Used the gym pool had a lot of little ones in so gave that a miss  If you are English and want tea with milk a little deli down the street towards the Lake front has half pint cartons and the ice machines in the corridors work  Make your own mini fridge using the ice bucket in the room  Excellent location will stay again  re Corner shop bakery for breakfast did not try it myself but did pop in on Sunday afternoon when it was very understaffed but as it is packed every morning they must be doing something right  
P => Well Above Average Stayed    Great location in Streeterville off of Mag Mile  Walked to Navy Pier  min Billy Goats  min amp Rush Street  min  Convenience store a block South  Rooms were clean but furniture worn  Upgraded to a  room suite at check in  Complimentary wireless web access local amp domestic long distance  Pool is ideal for small children  Large hot tub sauna and steam room   elevators with minimal waiting  Will stay again  
P => Disappointing and Overrated Stayed e    This was my second time to stay at this hotel the last being  or  years ago when it opened  I was very diappointed at how poorly the hotel was kept up as far as the rooms are concerned  Less than a  star rating if you consider the rooms only  In addition unlike some of the other reviews I checked out prior to booking the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbors quottalkingquot at regular volume  The staff were wonderful in trying to find another room that was quieter but the hotel was full and the few rooms I visited were ginally better  While the location is great if you are looking for a  star property look elsewhere  Also watch out for the high breakfast prices my child ordered an orange juice while I was in the buffet line and it cost   Better to walk across the street and pay a more moderate price at the Corner Bakery   
P => Staff unfriendly I booked this hotel having read the excellent reviews but I was very disappointed im afraid  and Im not difficult to please  My main problem was the reception staff who were seemingly disinterested in their guests their manner was hardly welcoming  Also some of the Concierge staff had the same attitude except a guy called Ryan who was helpful Anyway the rooms are ok the location is good and the bakery across the street is great for breakfast  
P => Excellent location but nice and quiet inside Stayed over the weekend and LOVED the location proximity to great Michigan Avenue shopping  Also two blocks from Lawrys Steak House excellent also  The rooms were quiet and the food at the restaurant was good although the breakfast buffet was  per person not sure that was a great value but Dunkin Donuts is a block away  Only negative was small poolworkout area and slow valet service to retrieve car  Otherwise a great location and very nice property  Walking distance to Art Institute Navy Pier Aquarium etc   
P => Outstanding and great bargain Absolutely excellent hotel in great location  Our room a standard room with two double beds was first class and very large  Feather pillows and comforters unfortunately my wife is allergic to them   the staff appeared within minutes to fulfill our request for non feather bedding  Bathroom was all ble sparkling clean and huge  Even though we shared our floor with a group of high school students on some sort of field trip we never heard a peep Public areas were beautiful  And all for  per night they do get you on the parking so if it matters perhaps you want to put your car in a public lot  
P => The BEST in Chicago Stayed at the Wyndham Chicago for one week around Easter and found this to be the best Hotel I stayed in Chicago where I once lived and frequently travel  The location cannot be beaten   one block away fom the Magnificent Mile  The rooms are large very nicely orated and the bathroom is not only huge but also extremly clean  The staff is very friendly especially at the front desk and the concierges  Very good restaurants in the area can recommend Kamehachi for sushi  Changed the hotel for each of my Chicago trips but now I will stay with the Wyndham 
P => Great Location Great Stay I was fortunate enough to reserve a room at the Wyndham Chicago at a really excellent rate  I had never stayed there before but I can asure you that I intend to make this my Chicago headquarters The location is extremely convenient to Michigan Ave  Magnificent Mile Navy Pier Art Institute and is a short cab ride away from all of the nightlife on Rush St  and Old Towne  There are at least  restaurants in the block surrounding the hotel some of which are very reasonably priced for Chicago The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful  Check in was a breeze since I joined Wyndham by Request frequentguest program  We found an arrival gift of wine crackers and cheese awaiting us  The room was clean well appointed and the bathroom is huge and has nice ble floors  Our room was extremely quiet despite being across the street from Northwestern Memorial Hospital I have stayed in a number of downtown Chicago hotels Westin Red Roof Hyatt etc  and found this one to be the most convenient  If you book on line you will get an unheard of rate for Chicago I highly recommend the Wyndham Chicago  
P => A good choice with I took  kids age range from  to  and  adults to Chicago for a one night stay  I booked the room through Wyndham and receieved the web rate for  double and  connecting doubles  The rooms were  a night and that included tax and were located on the th floor  This was great bargain for such a nice room  The bathroom was spotless  The only complaint I heard was about the pool size  The kids wanted a bigger pool  The hotel is close to everything or a short taxi or bus ride away  I joined the By Request program and there were a couple of comlimentary Coronas waiting for me when I checked in  I had to fight the kids for the Snickers bar  The staff was very helpful especially the bag handling staff  Great place at a great price  
P => Nice hotel great location Stayed for just  night last week  Superior to many hotels in the same class  Booked through Orbitz and the rate was same for queen or king bed so ended up with a nice room size  Wonderful down pillows an armchair with footstool and ergonomic chair at the desk  Bathroom was spotless  Fairly good wall insulation despite my room location being steps away from the elevator  Had dinner at the Caliterra restaurant  Better than I expected for a hotel restaurant and prices were more affordable than neighbouring places  As with other hotels breakfast was a rip off if you didnt have time to run across the street to Corner Bakery  Location is prime for this hotel being only  block east of Magnificent Mile  Overall enjoyable stay and would stay there again  
P => Great Stay The Wyndham was a perfect centrally located place for my dhter and I as we traveled to the North and South side of Chicago to visit colleges and visited museums  The Subway is several blocks away but the city buses are all along Michigan Ave  only a block away  You are also centrally located to a gorgeous shopping district on the Magnificent that is lively on the weekends and very close to the Navy yard which we missed out on visiting  We used public transportation everywhere but if you arrive via airport take the blue line tofrom OHare to Clarke Lake and cab it to the hotel for about   Its better than trying to find the subway stop thats blocks from the hotel with your bags in tow Room is clean pretty and large enough beautiful and confortable ble bathroom newspapers delivered every morning including Sunday  The concierge desk bellmans etc all helpful and even printed documents for me along with my airplane boarding passes  Wyndham by request came through with wine cheese and bottled water and I got one free breakfast with the room when I booked online  also FREE fast internet service for your laptop phone calls etc  with that by request card The corner bakery is also perfect for breakfast and break time  
P => wonderful weekend My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham Hotel this past week attending a Dental Convention  As directed by this forum thank you we signed up for Wyndham by Request and were amazed at our room  It was a wonderful suite french doors into bedroom etc and we had a great time  The location is ideal  Its right by Apple Computer store The Capital Grille and Dunkin Donuts could it get any better Entering the hotel is a little odd  Entrance is through street level to a nice quotbellmanquot station   ble steel etc   but then take elevator to nd floor actual lobby for registration  Then connect with another elevator way down another hall to access rooms  This is a tad inconvenient but not remotely bad enough to keep from staying here again  It was a perfect hotel  clean cordial and extremely comfortable  
P => First Class My hasband and I ided that each Christmas our present to each other would be to spend a night downtown  Last year we stayed at the Ritz Carlton and this year I ided to give the Wyndham a try after reading all of the great reviews  I joined the quotby Requestquot and was thrilled with the price and comfort of our suite  I was dissappointed that we were not able to get early check in and not happy at all with the bar service in the restaraunt  Our room was huge and beautiful and the service was great  The doorman whistled for our taxi something not done at the Ritz  The location is perfect we walked up and down the main drive 
P => Great Place Everything everyone has said is true  It is a great hotel  Make sure to join wyndham by request  I arrived at am much before the check in time  I was upgraded to some large suite with a doorbell and all kinds of other great stuff  I also got my fruit plate bottled water and corona as I requestd  My only complaint is I needed toothbrush and toothpaste and called down several times and never got one  But it was okay because of Wyndham by request  Ill be staying in a wyndham wherever I travel  
P => Very Good Stay Would Highly Recommend My wife and I stayed at the Wyndham Chicago for a few days before Christmas  This hotel was all we could have wanted and asked for in Chicago  We received a free suite upgrade to our surprise  The room was huge and very comfortable  Everything was very clean as well  Location for this hotel is perfect just slightly off Michigan Ave  I would also recommend the quotCorner Bakeryquot right across the street from the hotel  This place is perfect for breakfast and lunch  They have a wide varieties and food pastries and drink  Overall we were very pleased with our stay and wont hesitate to stay in the Wyndham Chicago again  
P => Great Stay at the Wyndham I stayed at the Wyndham Chicago the weekend of    My mom and I took my dhter to American Girl Place for Christmas  The location could not be better  Its right off Michigan Ave in a central place   you can walk to everything  Nearby on the next block over is a little breakfast cafe   quotSomethingquot Egg Cafe  Forget the first part   Ask the staff   they recommended it   it had a great hot breakfast  Inexpensive too  Also recommend the Grand Luxe Cafe for lunch or dinner and Giordanos for the best stuffed pizza ever  The staff was superb at the hotel and the room was large clean and a good value  Good view from the room  Thank you for making an important trip so enjoyable  
P => Very Nice Hotel I went on a shopping trip with two girlfriends and we had a great time at the Wyndham  My expectations were very high after reading other reviews  After joining the Wyndham by Request club as suggested by other reviewers I fully expected to be upgraded to a suite and was disappointed when there were none available  I did however get a Diet Coke and MampMs as I requested when joining Wyndham by Request  The bakery across the street was a great spot for breakfast relatively cheap and quick  The doormen who work there are great very friendly and helpful in hailing a cab and recommending restaurants  The location is perfect for shopping  We walked to all the Michigan Ave attractions with no problem  For  a night this hotel was satisfactory  I guess for that much money I expected a bigger room but overall it was a good experience  I would stay there again  
P => Wyndham was a silver lining to our dark rainy cloud Our family took a trip to Chicago to see the Cubs play  unfortunately the game was rained out and the tickets werent honored for the make up game  Needless to say we were very distrht and after several hours in the rain we finally arrived at the Wyndham  We got the room through priceline for  a night  The minute we walked into the beautiful and spacious room our disappointment from the baseball game was gone  What a sight The room suite  we asked for an upgrade after reading info from your site was bigger than our first house The elegant ble bathroom even had a telephone By far the most comfortable bed weve ever slept in  Cheese crackers and a bottle of champagne greeted us in the room  Every request was met with quick response  Upon our morning arrival the hotel gladly held our bags until our room was ready  The exercise area and pool were an added treat as we were traveling with children  The location was perfect  we walked or took the train everywhere which saved on cab fare  Close to the Navy Pier and American Girl Store a must do for girls  We would definitely stay there again  even for full price 
P => Wyndham ByRequest is    the way to go After referring to Trip Advisor ided to book the Wyndham  Book directly through the website you can get the best deals here if you prepay  Got a weekend rate of night  After getting another tip off this website I joined quotWyndham ByRequestquot which is free got a free upgrade to a Suite and they had cheese crackers and wine waiting for us in the room when we got there  The location of the hotel is great just around the corner from the Magnificient Mile  There was a good workout room and the staff was polite and helpful  We never ate at the hotel bc there is a quotCorner Bakeryquot across the street which is a great spot for breakfast  I would definitely recommend the Wyndham and plan to stay in one again in the future  Joining the ByRequest made the difference in our experience and I would recommend doing so

P =>  W  for  Without  Service Total Disapointment  Ive statyed at the San Diego New York and the Atlanta location  all goodThe W Chicago has small and older rooms with a with half way attempt from the hotel to make them look modern  Total lack of customer service with a quotdontquot care attitude  They made it seems like we were botherig them  There were no resolution to any request  They totally screwed up our invoice  The lobby and the lounge were quotdeadquot on a weekend I can now understand why  Take your money else where and stay 
P => Just OK I spent one night at the W City Center on business and wasnt all that impressed  The hotel is very chic and hip but the room is VERY small  The bathroom in particular was difficult to maneuver in due to how small it was  The bed was very comfortable and the TV was nice along with all of the power plugs  TV inputs available right there on the wall  The room was also VERY sparsely orated I know its supposed to be hip but the way they did it just seemed cold Noise was a small issue as there was construction down on the street no the Ws fault and the train could be heard passing by as well  Not extreme but somewhat annoying in the morning  The location was great and access to everything I needed was there but overall for the money Id stay somewhere else  
P => Tiny nickel and dimed us at every turn This was the worst hotel Ive stayed in for a very long time  I imagine this is what it would feel like if ikea orated a hotel room  a room in a tiny space lab The rooms were so small and the amenities were next to none  they didnt even provide local magazines just more advertising brochures for the W  It was very uncomfortable  you could barely even use the toilet  The bed was comfortable but that was pretty much the full size of the room  The view was non existent and the walls were so thin you could hear very clearly into other rooms  The only thing worse than the room was the service  We asked for a nearby breakfast place and the concierge just pointed us to starbucks  When we couldnt find ice and called down for help they were so snobby saying theres ice on every floor  turns out it was in a locked unked room When we tried out the bar downstairs the bartender was very unfriendly and the overall space was small and dark  The room service more than doubled the price of the items which were already inflated    for a chicken sandwich The area at night is pretty dead  I highly recommend you pass on this one   definitely NOT one of starwoods strongest showings     
P => Convenient and chic We stayed at this hotel because it was close to the location of business meetings but I would stay here again even if I didnt need to be in this neighborhood  As an early riser I appreciated the nearby choices that opened early for morning coffee runs Dunkin Donuts McDonalds and some other cafes very closeby  The staff were friendly and helpful and acted as though they genuinely appreciated our business  The room was clean comfortable and quiet enough for a good nights sleep  And I love that they use bliss bath products 
P => it was cozy When we checked in quotCOZYquot is how the receptionist described our room  We got into chicago mid morning and luckily for us our room was ready  I booked this room on hotwire com  The hotel is located in the loop which is what i wanted  Some of the rooms actually face the track of the quotLquot a co worker suggested asking about this at check in because he had trouble sleeping  Also rooms   face the elevators i think we had room   Anyway back to the coziness of this room  The roomi was told was just under  square feet  to be exact In all reality it was enough for two people for one night  There was a king sized bed a little night stand a small desk and a flat screen TV hanging off the wall  There was a nice clockradio with ipod dock which we didnt use  On the desk there was a cordless phone another one on the nightstand and internet connections at a charge  The receptionist did mention this at check in internet in the room would cost us but in the lobby there was free wi fi  Some of the channels on the TV appeared to be in Hi Def and some didnt  The bathroom as to be expected was extremely small but it was enough  The shower had great water pressure actually something most hotels lack  There was a window that opened up into the center of the building you had a view of the rooms across the way  Not real exciting  The lobby was very interestingly orated dim and lots of colored lights i felt like i was walking into a club instead of a hotel  Despite the fact that the room was small it still meet all the expectations it had a bed tv and a good shower and it was clean  
P => Nothing wrong with this place I stayed at the W for one night recently after not having stayed there for about six years  The rooms are admittedly small but the hotel was clean and quiet and well located for my office building SearsWillis tower  The price was reasonable  If I were coming to Chicago for leisure and paying on my own I would probably stay near the Magnificent Mile as the hotels are better located more things to do in the evening  After pm nothing is open near this hotel The quotbusiness centerquot was incredibly expensive and not used because of the high prices  Overall no major complaints  
P => Great Location for athon Weekend Recently stayed at the W for the Chicago athon weekend  I was concerned given a number of the poor reviews that the hotel got on the TA website  I normally do not write reviews but felt compelled to do so this time so I could put my two cents in about the hotel  I found the hotel to be classy establishment  The room was immaculately cleaned every day by housekeeping  The flat panel tv was a nice touch and the bed very comfortable  One does notice the El outside but it did not bother me at night  I enjoyed the chic lobby and we had drinks Friday night at the bar upstairs  The bar in the lobby was bustling on Friday and there was a good energy to the hotel that night  I was pleasantly surprised by the helpful staff at the desks and at the doors  I would definitely come back to the W  The location is great  
P => Never ever again    To start off Im in   yrs old age group traveled in Europe US Canada Russia  Terrible terrible experience with the W   City Center in Chicago Ridiculous price for crap roomsservice  Feeling of the old building with new paint splashed all over stayed through out the stay  Tiny little other words describing the size go here rooms make you feel swashed  Mats that say quotgood morningquot and quotgood eveningquot depending of the time of the day   the only positive thing I recall  Rude young bar attender  Room service overpriced for the food and style it is served  On the cc statement found valet parking fee that never happened  The day before departure during the day cleaning crew broke the shower shelve maintenance was in at around pm  Booked and had to stay at that place  days   terrible experience  
P => Would stay again My husband and I were in Chicago to see a Springsteen concert and just needed a place to sleep so we let Hotwire pick the hotel for this trip  Overall we were pleased with the W City Center  The service was great and everyone we talked to was very helpful and friendly  The or was chic and fun with lots of hipsters milling about the lobby  It was clean in the public areas as well as the room  The holograms lining the elevators could induce seizures but they are interesting if you dont stare at them too long  My only complaint about the hotel was the size of our room  Unfortunately the garitas I had at Frontera Grill hadnt worn off before I went to bed so I never did figure out how to shut off the lights around the perimeter of the platform bed  I felt like I was spending the week end in a tanning booth  One of the best surprises at the hotel was the Acura Experience  They offer a FREE car service to anywhere within a  mile radius of the hotel so we were thrilled not to call a cab to get us to the concert  The location of the hotel is great for tourist y things although it is not in the happenin nightlife area  It is a only a couple blocks to the EL and the train so getting to and from the airport is very easy  The parking rate per night was  which would be a waste considering all the transportation options available  We would definitely stay here again but certainly wouldnt pay rack rate  
P => Great Location Nice Accommodation Great Location in the Loop and close to the elevated train station stop  Rooms are a bit small but have a very chic or the whole hotel has that or theme   trendy lounge Price was reasonable  BUT WATCH OUT for the hidden charges they tack on to your final bill  I was charged for Room services mini bar items that i never touched  I guess it was their way of getting back at me for using an external discount website  similar to price line to book the room which saved me about   of the regular room rate 
P => Sometimes good things come in small packages   but not this time  Im going to start this review by saying I am not a hip  something clubgoer  So Im probably not part of the Ws target demographics  I was glad I was with a colleague who was familiar with the hotel because I would have had a very difficult time finding the reception desk tucked in a dark corner in the back and would have been extremely intimidated by the ultra hip people swilling colorful tinis on low white leather upholstered couches between the door and the reception desk  Room was very small but fairly comfortable with lovely linens on the bed  Bathroom was dirty when I arrived   dirty glasses in the sink towels on the floor   yuck  I called down to the front desk and they promised to send the quotStyle Departmentquot up to fix the situation while I was at dinner which they did  The bath amenities are top rate but the sink was so small I literally had to put my toiletries in the bedroom on the dresser because there was no room in the bathroom  I only got a newspaper the first day of three which didnt bother me that much but it showed a lack of attention to detail  The room I had was on the front of the hotel on the opposite end from the El and the train noise did not bother me a bit It is a reated older hotel and has the low ceilings and narrow twisting hallways youd associate with an old hotel  My colleague had a room with no closet  Seriously  This is a strange place and rather than relaxing me the hepped up feel was stressful and disorienting  Wouldnt recommend it except for sylistas who want to see and be seen  
P => Couldnt have been happier I recently stayed at this hotel for a wedding that I was a part of  I was a bit nervous as I was traveling with my  month old twin dhters and I didnt think that this was the type of hotel that we should be staying at with them  Upon check in we were immediately greeted and cared for like we were their only guests  I cannot tell you how polite and helpful the staff was  Their motto of quotwhatever wheneverquot is truly not lost on any of the team members  The hotel was very clean and cared for  I cant thank them enough for making my stressful trip into a leisure stay  Good work 
P => Nice but it was a free night   different opinion if I paid Let me set up the scene for this conference trip   hotels  nights  Everything that could cause hotels to be booked U concert was going on in Chicago   and several idiot wedding parties here at the hotel mid tember  Our night at the W City Center was a Sunday  This area of town is DEAD after dark and almost uncomfortably so when walking about  There was very little to do so we went out on the town A little back story I have stayed in countless W Hotels  I have gotten past the wannabees and glamouratti set the sex dungeon and Abercrombie store ors and I just like the general service level at the W  So continuing on the hotel graciously upgraded us to a Spectacular SMOKING room  which was nice  The room was big enough and had enough windows to be acceptable for smoking  I would not have paid the rack rate of  for this Ikea furnish spartan room but it was great for free  The room was spacious and comfortable  The beds were standard W fare  The WheneverWhatever accommodated some odd requests we had although one of my friends was mildly offended that he kept being referred to as maam on the phone The lobby is a beautiful beaux arte building with the W style  The bar was small   I mean small  The champagne still tasted the same but there wasnt even nightlife in the lobby   which is my usual quip with W but this place was at   and still dead  Everyone leaves the hotel as there isnt anything around   well at McDonalds and the ever present Charbucks on the street corner  My big complaint lame as it is HBO wouldnt come on and we wanted to watch the season finale of True Blood We used the heck out of the Acura Experience It is free up to  miles for hotel guests I would recommend tipping the drivers  Arthur was super Likes big room SMOKING big room better lobby coffee than Charbucks if it is from there dont tell me Acura experience and the staff Dislikes I would have found things to complain about for rack price location location and the out of place guests that should have been at the HoJo not the hotels fault paying for INTERNET 
P => we will be back My wife and Iwent here for a romantic get away   I choose this W for my wife and to my surprise   This was a very nice and updated hotel that we both feel in love withWe ate dinner once and breakfast once and both times and the meals are awesomeThe rooms are small but very very nice  with upgraded t v  bed and other things makes this hotel very nice  The gym is a quotquot from  to  This hotel is close to the MONROE Trainsubway station  blocks to be exact  So remember to take the quotLquot train from Ohare for   per person get off on MONROE and walk  blocks and ur thereOver all we loved the location the people and the city        I hope you have a wonderful time as we did Thanks 
P => What a Joke One of the Worst Hotels in Chicago A bunch of wanna be trendees in a plastic hotel that is impossible to cover up small rooms with incredibly small bathrooms with Ikea furniture and plastic over priced everything else  We were part of a wedding party that had a large block of rooms   the comments above reflect not only the consensus of our group but also that of another wedding party for the same night  The sentiment was universally held by  somethings to  somethings  The price of the rooms was exorbitant and the value was ridiculous  We stayed at the Knickerbocker earlier in the week on the North end of Michigan Av for half the price double the room size exemplary concierge service and great location  Weve been in a dozen other Chicago hotels in the loop michigan av oakbrook and lincoln park areas    all significantly better 
P => Tiny and extras are expensive The hotel is just fine for a business stay   it is moderately clean see below and the staff do seem to care about your stay Nonetheless something is wrong when you cant open the toilet seat because the toilet paper roll is in the way  I had to take the toilet paper out in order to open and close the toilet lid  When I am traveling on business I do not need a lot of space but this is too much  The other complaint is that the halls and sometimes the rooms smell of dirty vacuum cleaners  Otherwise things seemed clean Finally I have found that between room service the hotel restaurant wifi etc  that the price can jack up pretty quickly from the base rate  These amenities are not inexpensive and I wish I had just booked a place that had a higher base rate but wasnt as pricey in the end  
P => Very un W hotel with extremely bad service  I always think that any service oriented entity should be measured by how they respond to things that are out of their control   and today that happened and in my mind W   City center COMPLETELY FAILED  W  City center had pipeline disruption this morning at  AM  I was trying to get to shower around that time   couldnt  Waited for  minutes   called Front desk   they gave me an ETA of  am   AM goes by   still no water   and no one bothered to call me and tell mea What is going onb Any other options availableSo I call at  AM   still the same story   no apologies no suggestions for any alternatives I wait for an hour   call at  AM   Same story again  I had to cancel out of my meeting that was scheduled at  PM   came down to the hotel at  noon to check out   the receptionist asks me boldly how my stay was  I told her that it has been horrible since AM and then she offers a coupon for taking a shower in a nearby Gym  Nice  First of all I wish the W gave me this option  hours ago   Second still the total non apologetic tone of the receptionist   put me off  I travel to Chitown quite a bit  but this hotel is OFF my list  I would rather stay in Westin River North   which is a much better place and the rooms are bigger than W as well  
P => Great Hotel  Fun Stay We stayed at the W City Center from   in a regular room  I know the reviews for this hotel go back and forth  I went back and forth as well when iding on the hotel  They had a summer promotion where I paid for two nights and got the rd night free so we jumped on it  Im glad we did First of all everyone else is correct the rooms are very small  It really wouldnt work with kids at all  The bed takes up the majority of the room but it is very comfortable and cozy  Everything in the room bottled water snacks etc is hugely overpriced so we didnt use any of that  Room service was high as well  However the hotel was very quiet and very calm once you got upstairs The crowd downstairs seemed like it could be a bit snotty  after getting back the hotel exhausted from a concert and grabbing food from McDonalds the only thing open anywhere close to our hotel we did receive a few death glares from some of the nicer dressed patrons  Once you hit the elevators though yes with revolving Good Morning Good Afternoon Good Evening floor mats the hallways and rooms were immaculate and quiet I would highly recommend this hotel for singles or couples and its location was very convenient for everything we wanted to see  Comfy calm rooms sleek modern design and a great and helpful staff  We also used the Acura car service which didnt start until  PM but had a great driver and no problems getting a ride  
P => Adequate Hotel for Business Travelers but not for Vacationers I m a Starwood card member and anytime I travel for business I prefer to stay at one of the properties  The W Hotel is my favorite Starwood brand so when I traveled to Chicago for Lollapalooza I booked five nights at the W Hotel City Center  got a ent rate using my AAA card  The hotel lobby is beautiful on the inside  It reminded me of being in an exclusive hotel in NYC  The aesthetic of the outside of the building blends in perfectly with downtown  I booked this hotel because it s walking distance to Grant Park where Lollapalooza was being held  Very convenient location but the area is dead on the weekends  I ordered room service alot due to the lack of restaurants being open  The gym SWEAT was okay but not fancy  Unfortunately the property has no pool so if you want to beat the Chicago heat during the summer and you are brand loyal book the W Hotel Lakeshore  Room service was quick and the staff was helpful  I asked an attendant at the front door where I could find the nearest Harold s restaurant and he directed me to nearest location promptly My room was on the th floor  Make sure to request a room that faces the front of the building or you ll be facing the back which faces another building no sunlight  I had a wonderful room which was nice  There are a lot of light switches for the minimal amount of light they produce   the light under the bed was kinda cool My only major complaint was the noise from the room next to mine  thin walls and the activities in the hallway cleaning staff seemed to slam doors non stop  
P => Good but with a few warnings Great location staff is very friendly and helpful  Beds are comfy large plasma TV    Like all W hotels stylish and very busy  The lobby entrance is actually the middle of the bar lounge area so if you are unlucky enough like myself to arrive when this is packed as often it is its an obstacle course with your luggage in tow trying to get to the Front Desk and elevators  As a Starwood Gold member and it alwayshappens that the W quotupgradesquot are a joke in my experience particular at Ws as opposed to ttheir other propert ies actually do provide upgrades that are more than the standard room  The front desk told me they upgraded me to a one of their best rooms well it was right across the elevators never good and the room was TINY where even the bathroom ble sink counter was cut slightly to allow for the door to openclose Almost have to walk in sideways in the bathroom  Room itself was bigger but ginally the closet was in the wall of the bathroom which again is questionable if it was the width a normal door  Gym is a glorified hallway equipment limited but have a huge empty space  of the actual gym area with a couch and tiled floor  Looks nice but not very useful in a gym especially with only  x mat provided  So great location comfy and stylish popular bar but check on your room size  
P => Hip hotel Great location Swanky lounge Stayed at this hotel with my husband during a weekend visit to Chicago  I travel a ton for business and stay at a lot of riotts and Westins but am not usually at W hotels  I was pleased with the service I was upgraded upon checking in to a larger suite and while I am a Starwood member and was using points for the room that was a nice surprise The room was really clean and had some nice touches including a canvas shoe storage hanger in the closet Bliss bath and body works and an iPod connector My only complaint was that I got charged  for the room and  for the mini bar and had to call the accounting department to get those charges removed  I shouldnt have been charged for the room since I was using Starwood points and while I looked in the mini bar I didnt use anything from it However I am not going to ding the hotel for this as they promptly resolved my charges with one phone call  
P => Funky Hotel Central Location Cool Vibe   Had a Great Stay This W Hotel is newly reated  From the moment you walk into the lobby or quotLiving Roomquot you know this not your typical American hotel  In keeping with the W Hotel chain approach this hotel is very funky  The Living Room had a cool nightclublounge vibe going the staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were impeccable  My only complaint is the WiFi should be in the room rate  WiFI is available in the Living Room free but the charge for in room is a rip off for a hotel at these ratesLocated in the Loop near the former Sears Tower it was Central to pretty much everything  Less than a  minute walk to the Mag Mile and close to El I would stay here again no questions asked  
P => Swanky sexy and hip hotel Went to Chicago for the weekend first visit  The hotel is very trendy and cool and loved it from the moment I walked in  I had read some of the reviews and was worried what the room was going to be like as I m not a fan of Ikea all I can say is the folk that wrote that obviously are old fashioned or I guess you are used to staying in k or more hotel room but then for  I was well impressed  I was upgraded with my SPG plat status to a larger room and felt completely at home and no I don t shop in Ikea It was very modern had fantastic inc HD tv on the wall plenty of room  The bed was pretty good too The hotel was in a good location right by Willis Tower formally Sears and a short  mins from Michigan  Staff were really friendly and helpful  In the mornings there was complimentary coffee in the bar the only minus point on hotel is there wasn t a business lounge  I would definite recommend this hotel it was one of the nicer hotels I ve stayed in and I ve been about a fair bit 
P => Best pet friendly hotel in Chicago I relocated from the Western New York to the Minneapolis late last year and Chicago was my logical overnight stop  I wasnt travelling alone I had my  lb  German Shepherd K  and two cats in the vehicle with me I called several supposedly quotpet friendlyquot hotels Hilton among others and while they claimed to serve travelers with pets they had restrictions as to how large the dog could be  Each time I explained that the dog I was travelling with weighed over  lbs  I was told that they couldnt accommodate me as they restricted dogs to  lbs  or less  The fact that the dog in question is an impeccably trained and housebroken military K  made no difference whatsoever Just as I was about to give up and resign myself to either driving straight through or pulling over at a rest stop and sleeping in my SUV I made one final call to the W City Center Chicago and told them the size of the dog in question Even though W has a size restriction as well they were quite willing to accept the dog as a guest as well and on my arrival I was greeted by two members of the bell staff who assisted in unloading my necessary baggage including two somewhat annoyed cats who had just spent  hours in travel carriers The front desk staff expedited my check in and when I arrived in my room I was greeted by a welcoming note from the management staff and a complimentary bottle of red wine in addition to a dog bed and treats for the dog and catsI had a wonderfully restful night on what  have been the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the following morning a member of the bell staff arrived at my room within minutes of my call to the front desk informing them that I was ready to check out  By the time we got to the lobby my vehicle was waiting at the front entrance and two more members of the bell staff assisted me in getting the animals and baggage loaded The W Chicago City Center and staff made what could have been a stressful uncomfortable night a VERY positive experience  Next time I travel through Chicago with my K  this will be my hotel of choice  
P => Nice hotel but check room size when booking This hotel is like walking into a nightclub  It always feels like its evening regardless of the time of day  The front desk is situated to the back left   near the elevators  It takes directions to find My check in experience was fine and the staff was friendly  She informed me the room I was getting was newly reated  When I got to that room unfortunately it did smell newly reated too bad  Also it was tiny  It could not have been more that  square feet  There was a small shower and a bathroom with no place to put toiletries  A waste can has no home and nearly blocks the toilet  They call this a quotWonderful Roomquot  I would disagree  This is a room for a business person traveling alone who will need use of a desk but not a relaxing chair to kick back in as it had none I called to explain to the front desk that this room was not to my satisfaction and is not what I booked or anticipated  I was told I could upgrade for  extra per night  Finally after going down to the front desk and speaking with Justin this is all around am he took care of the problem and immediately offered to move me to a new room  He had obviously heard this complaint before  The new room was possibly twice the size The beds are comfortable and the bedding and pillows are very nice  The style is contemporary with clean lines  Plenty of lighting by the bed for reading  Bed lights up from below as well   with LED lights The fixtures are nice and there are  layered roman shades  One shade allows you to see out of the window but distorts the incoming view  The other shade blocks the light  Nicely done  The TVs are very large and there are plenty of outlets to plug in items on the desk  There is a charge for wireless internet  Be careful on the Fiji Water at   per bottle The bathroom has plenty of towels good lighting and amenities shampoo body lotion   all by Bliss  The lounge offered nice choices and good service  The concierge could have improved in the friendliness category  The bell service was very good as were rest of the staff when asked for help When booking this hotel be sure to check the room size  I did have a confirmed  sq ft room on my reservation print out  Fortunately the new person who took over the desk that night was better trained in customer service than the previous First impressions are important  The first room I checked in to nearly ruined my entire experience at this hotel  The management should take note  If your patron confirms a particular type of room you should meet or exceed that expectation and your staff should be trained to make sure this happens when assigning the room The main reason I am not recommending this hotel to a friend is that I believe there are nicer places for the money  
P => Chic clean comfortable  Service Very friendly very accommodating front desk service  We had an issue the first morning with the hot water and the staff addressed it immediately and did not have a problem for the remainder of the stay  We received cordial professional customer service from every member of the staff  The one concierge assistant we dealt with had some basic knowledge of local restaurants and sights to see  But also   and its not the hugest deal   I needed to get to a Walgreens and she was unable to direct me to the closest one which I later found to be only a block and half away  Amenities The gym was awesome   each cardio machine has an individual TV updated equipment and plenty of space to stretch  They offer headsets for each of the machines in case you dont have one and water bottles and fruit  The rooms come with Bliss Spa products which I thought was a nice touch  The large flat screen TV  cable was a major plus and our room also had a DVD player which we used  Lobby area There is free Wi Fi in the lobby area which is nice  If you want Wi Fi in the room you have to pay for it  Luckily the lobby area was never crowded to the point where we couldnt sit comfortably to surf the web  The only complaint I have about the lobby area is that the music they have playing techno which rarely changes is usually on medium volume or blasting  I get that its supposed to have a quotloungyquot type atmosphere and I can appreciate that concept  But it would have been nice to hear other genres of music i e  Mowtown swinging jazz andor some groovy s poprock just to name a few   Food We never tried the restaurant but we had some appetizers Italian meat plate and gourmet olives and it was pretty good  
P => Took some work but nice stay overall Ok I booked through hotwire com for a  star for  and got the W Hotel city center in Chicago  I called right away because I just wanted to be sure their base rooms had two beds  Anything booked online automatically gets you their quotcozyquot room  This room is x and is sooooo small  We were guranteed a king size bed despite the room size  I argued and argued with hotwire com and they couldve cared less we were stuck with one bed rooms  I get to the hotel and they offer to upgrade us to a suite for an additional   They promise a king size bed  bathrooms a pull out couch and room for a cot  We say ok  We get up to the quotsuitequot and there is no pull out  bathroom and its tight  We go to my friends cozy room and there is a queen size bed there  I go to the front desk and complain and they put my friends in an ADA accessible room handicap accessible and offer us another suite to check out  I go up to the ADA room and its HUGE and beautiful  And has a king size bed and they gave it to us for the original online booking fee  The second suite was no better than the first  So I go back down and ask to be in an ADA room too and they comply  So they took off the  suite fee and put us both in ADA rooms  These rooms are also directly tied to the fire escape and the windows open fully for some reason so we had a great little balcony to go out on  ASK FOR THE ADA ROOM SAY YOU HAVE A HANDICAP PERSON OR WHATEVER  ITS WORTH IT  The hotel is beauitful beds comfortable and their motto is quotwhatever wheneverquot in reference to whatever your wish is I did have a run in with the security guard telling me I couldnt bring beer into the hotel for my room  A quick conversation with the front desk fixed that but it was still very rude It is VERY frustrating booking online when you dont get what you expect  Hopefully those of you that book online and are frustrated too know to get an ADA room and all will be well  
P => Trying too Hard We were booked into this hotel for a one day conference  If it hadnt been in the middle of our stay I would have moved  The lobby is a beautiful space with old architectural affects but it is lit with purple blue and pink neon  Way Too Cool for a sophisticated hotel  There is very loud quothipquot music playing all the time  The public spaces are nerve wracking  But the elevators top it all If you were stuck in one for any time you would end up a gibbering mess  They somehow have a D effect with planets in blue purple and tan seeming to float at you  But the planets are not in focus so you continually try to get in a place where they will all seem right  There is loud music playing here also and a sickly sweet odor  I think they havent figured out how to assault your taste buds or there would have been a flavor  We were on the th floor and the noise from the quotLquot was noticeable  The bed was very comfortable and the other furnishings were fine if not so comfortable  The bath was a nice size but nothing special the same old tub with a shower head  The towels were very thin  Our view was into the other rooms of the hotel  I think it is too far away from the fun places to suit me   The staff was very courteous and professional  Our bellman was even a little apologetic over the excesses of the hotel  I was annoyed over the  charge to use the internet in the rooms and a charge to use the business area  There is a free connection in the lobby but no one could ever do any work there  I did like the FareWell kiosk which allows you to check out and print your boarding pass  But all in all I would prefer a calm soothing place to stay  
P => Nice Hotel  Our Room was Big We stayed at the W Chicago City Center for one weekend night with one child  As a Starwood preferred gold member we were upgraded and I must say the room was excellent and large with a very large bathroom  The room faced the interior courtyard and was very quiet  Furnishings are very nice but W needs to learn a thing or two from Westin about comfortable beds  The quotStylequot department come on   dont try so hard to be cool brought a cot for our dhter promptly  We did not eat here or use room service  The location really is excellent for the financialtheatre district and close to MilleniumGrant Park and the Museums  Quite a walk to Magnificent Mile however  Overall  we will stay here again for the location and ability to utilize Starwood points  
P => Cool Atmosphere LOCATION  seem a bit far from Magnificent Mile but Chicago is big so this location was good  In the financial area so the weekend is less busy here  Just a  minute walk to the lake or Millennium Park and  minutes to the Wrigley Building ROOM Good size  Very modern and contemporary  Cool orations  Great amenities and Bliss bathroom products HOTEL The lobby and public areas are unique and chic  The location is not the best but if you get a good rate dont mind the walk then this hotel is greatCITY Chicago has so much to offer  Just consult your tour book  
P => W Hotel   Mingling with the hip crowd   Near the amtrak station I booked the W hotel City Center because the hotel was close to amtrak and had an aarp discount  My senior citizen husband and I had a comfortable quite room  Staying at the W is like staying in a piece of art  Design is everywhere even in the business center  A stunning lobby and swank elevator When we arrived the lobby was full of ish stylishly dressed people enjoying drinks food and conversation  Check in was quick and the staff was very helpful  Location location  This hotel is  blocks or so from the Chicago Union Station and about  blocks from the Art Institute of Chicago  
P => Ikea Hotel If you stay here ask for a room on the upper floors  Why Because you cant hear the L as much and because the rooms havent been reated yet  The reated rooms look like a page out of an Ikea catalog  White cheap furniture  I was reminded of the super small rooms you get in European hotels where all the furniture is attached to the walls  Other than the noise and the or the rooms are fine  Love the Bliss toiletries room service was prompt and accurate wake up calls came on time and the facilities were clean  The AC was broken in the workout room but it was the first hot day of the year so they probably werent prepared  Overall my stay was average  If you plan to stay here pack your earplugs and get a room on the th floor  
P => Ask for a reated room This is a typical W with over the top styling  The lobby is nice and had a nice bar scene at night  Room service is a disaster dont bother using it  Also there is a tie in with Acura where the hotel will drive you to a destination for free in an Acura MDX  As for the rooms I was traveling with a colleague and we both booked the same type of room  Apparently I was given a newly reated room that was just put back online that week which was verified by the fresh paint smell in the room  The room was very clean and was what you would expect at a W  It was nice and there was plenty of workspace  Though it was quite possibly the smallest bathroom Ive ever seen  My colleague however compared his room to an old Holiday Inn room that had been redone in the W style  Room service was a disaster  I ordered a bowl of cereal and banana for breakfast  Over an hour later I was brought a meal that was completely wrong  After calling to get the correct meal I was promised it would be brought up but it never happened  Though to their credit I was not billed for the meal  They gym is nice with several elliptical machines treadmills and weight machines  
P => Trendy and Upscale   I will stay here again and again I stayed at the W City Center  years ago and loved it so much I chose it again for my nd stay in Chicago this il  I was not dissapointed   It is still as wonderful as it was my first stayThe W City Center is a very trendy posh hotel  Go there expecting a happening nightlife scene in the lobby and dark lit hallways  Not a child friendly atmosphere  The lobby has a great barlounge that gets pretty packed after work and on the weekends  They offer free flavored water and fruits in various parts of the hotel lobby fitness center business center etc The service is impeccable  Everybody is ready amp willing to help with anything you want  They really live up to their quotwhateverwheneverquot motto  The front desk is super friendly and accomadating and the consierge could not have been more helpful  He personally called us to give us reccomendations for dinnernightlife based on the other places we had been amp liked  Great serviceAnother great perk is the free Acura service the hotel offers for destinations within a  mile radius  You just book a time in advance and have a brand new Acura take you to your destination from PM PM i believe and save money on cab fare But if you do need to take a cab you will have no problem getting one right outside the hotel doors  And the hotel is also incredibly convenient to the El since its in the loop  Easy walking distance to ALL train lines The rooms are spacious at least the room with  double beds is i remember staying the last time in a king size room and it being semi small and beautifully orated  The beds and pillows are so comfortable  The bathrooms are nice and the Bliss Spa products are GREAT  I really have no complaints about the rooms at all All and all Im glad I stayed here for the nd time and will likely stay here again the next time I visit Chicago  The hotel is beautiful has great service and just a great overall vibe  
P => The W was really nice  This was probably the nicest hotel I ever stayed in  I work for Starwood so be I am biased for Starwood properties and know the hotel industry so I dont complain at small little things like most hotel guests  The room was very nice and we werent even on a reated floor  Three people stayed in a room with  double beds and we had a great time  We heard the subway but in the distance sounded like wind  Its not really the front desk agents problem so call the city with a noise complaint and there is free wireless in the lobby so you can skip the fee  
P => Made me loyal to the W Hotel I booked a quotlast minute packagequot through a travel site and stayed at the W City Center for  nights in    From the moment I walked in I fell in love with this hotel and from the moment I left I knew Id always look for a W hotel for future hotel stays  They have a quotwhatever wheneverquot philosophy that is truly that  When checking in I was given a free upgrade on my room without asking  The rooms were nicely orated and beds super comfortable  Bath products were from Bliss Spas  The hotel is nicely situated   walking distance to Milenium park and the car service could take you to Mag Mile or Hancock Building  They have a free Acura car service that will drive you around town and a concierge who is very knowledgeable  I asked which CD was playing in their car service and not only did they tell me but I received  free CDs compilations by the W hotel  On my last day there I had lunch at the quotliving roomquot bar and asked the bartender if she knew where to find Voss water outside of my room since it was  there   she gave me a bottle for free  Every encounter I had with a staff member at this hotel was above and beyond and this stay made me fall in love with the W brand  Every time I travel I look first to see if there is a W to stay at  
P => Urban Oasis   great stay awesome place My recent weekend stay Easter weekend was my third stay at this hotel  I am always amazed by how this place and other W hotels evoke such vehemently negative reviews from some people  I try to find some of the things that people write that they find so annoying but I just cant   I find this place to be so awesome Im always impressed For this visitArrival   I arrived on an early morning flight to Chicago and took the CTA train from OHare to downtown Chicago   an easy trip as I dont carry a lot of luggage  Exited the blue line subway and walked about  blocks to the W City Center  The first impression of the Living Room lobby and Welcome Desk registration is so serene and cool   I find it really relaning cant beleive that others find it frenetic  Its so stylishing lit with elements of repeating circles like water droplets small mirrors ble cut floors  curved seating pieces  the mixing of modern design with the traditional architectual elements of the building come off as a wonderful assemblage  The welcome desk agent was very friendly and efficient  To my delight I was able to get into my room right away   even thouh I was  hours prior to check in time   Yeaht My SPG membership was acknowledged and I was told that they were glad to have me return here again  Elevators smell so good and have a wonderful modern art assemblage within  My room was on the th floor overlooking interior courtyard I asked for a quiet room   overlooking the courtyard reduces the urban noise and the ambient noise from the nearby L trains  RoomMy room was spacious or was very cool modern with a cool minimalist vibe  Everything was spotlessly clean and was in order  At this time most of the lower floors are closed for reation but redone floors are opening up for occupancy every week  I saw one of the newly opened floors   totally rehabed not just surface rehab but new everything   a much brighter palette of white for these floors but still looks hip and minimalist  Looks very nice but I still love the older noir W look as well  Did my unpacking   nice spacious closet and plenty of drawer space   everything looks better in the W space Bathroom was huge   and love the Bliss toiletries I buy them for use at home  Then I left the hotel to enjoy a full day out in the city  For rest of my stay room was always cleaned well and linenstoiletries replaced I never heard any noise all weekend   the bed and the bathrobe was wonderfully comfortable AmenitiesUsed the quotSweatquot Fitness Center   great equipment and sparkling clean well maintained I had a nightime drink and Hummus snack in the Living Room lounge which was pretty deserted for the Easter weekend but nevertheless   its was still so much fun just to relax here and I loved the cocktail that I had   lots of interesting drinks to try on the menu  Had a lovely breakfast at the We restaurant   service was friendly and efficient All staff that I encountered   servers concierge stylists housekeeping doormen everyone was great   seemed genuinely friendly and eager to please I asked for and was cheerfully given a late check out another benefit for SPG membership  This allowed me to have another full day in the city before heading home Only glitches to an otherwise perfect stay Requested turndown service and it was never done   not a big deal just a minor disappointment  Bill folio that was slid under my door in morning prior to checkout charged me a higher room rate than I reserved and confirmed at check in  I brought this to attention of the Welcome Desk and it was corrected right away with an apology   no hassle  The correct amount was billed to my account the day after check out I have always enjoyed this hotel and this stay reinforced my feelings  I look forward to returning again when the reations are furhter along  If you enjoy a different experience than they typical luxury hotel and you have an appreciation of modern asethetics design art music I would definitely recommend a stay at the W   Chicago City Center 
P => Swanky Fun My husband and I and our two friends stayed at the W Hotel for two nights during a weekend and had a blast  The hotel is very chic swanky upscale and we were very glad that we chose this one for my birthday weekend The location is great especially if you are wanting to be near fun bars and hotels and the museums  We took a lot of cabs and they were not expensive at all  The hotel itself is gorgeous and sexy  The hotel bar quotThe Living Roomquot is quite cool but in the evenings its a hot spot and hard to find a place to sit  The rooms are very chic but tiny  We had a flat screen a huge bed an ipod dock and a nice bathroom  The hotel also has a very nice scent to it We had dinner at Tizi Melloul one night and Carnivale both of which were excellent  We also went to Nacionale  for salsa dancing but they apparently dont do it Friday nights  Bummer Id recommend this to couples and people wanting to have a fun time in Chicago  
P => Interesting experience a bit dark but okay All in all there is much to like about the W Hotel  The rooms are nice the TVs good the service just fine  The problem is that they are not up to the Ws usual standards  The lobby is extremely dark and I mean no lights and the beds are not of high enough quality in my opinion  Still the location cant be beat and although I would probably prefer to stay elsewhere in Chicago I could see coming back  
P => Not at all what we were expecting from a W Hotel When we checked in we were given an upgrade to a larger room by the very attentive front desk staff  That is where the good stopped with our stay at this hotel  We were on the th floor overlooking Adams St and were at first pleased with the room  Then the first Elevated Train came by  It was so loud that the only way to drown it out was to turn the fan on high  We then went into the bathroom where we found a used eyelash curler laying on the floor under the sink  In the room we were surprised at the relatively old non HD TV with a remote that barely worked  What really made me upset though was the   mini bar charge that appeared on my checking account statement later that week  At no point did we use anything from the mini bar  Overall a terrible stay at a terrible property  
P => Dont Listen to these Negative Nellies Im not an idiot and I realize that the majority of these reviews are negative because only people who have something to complain about write reviews  I visited this website before my boyfriend and I stayed at the W City Center but after we had booked the room  Needless to say we grew quite worrisome about our weekend trip to Chicago  That is until we got there    This hotel was amazing Everyone from the valet people to the front desk help were incredibly polite and always smiling  Upon check in like a lot of other W guests we were upgraded to a larger room  We stayed on the th floor and were amazed at the size of the room and the bathroom Huge We did hear the El but lets be serious people there is little that can be done about that Wear earplugs Lol  This was our first stay at a W hotel and trust me there will be many more but I can see why certain people i e  old sticks in the mud wouldnt like the W hotels  They are young modern and yes quite noisy but they are bustling with activity This is not some stuffy hotel where you feel like you are not welcome  We are a young gay couple and we absolutely loved our time at the WTo combat some of the negative opinions Our bathroom was huge nothing like having to sit with our legs at an angle with the counter pointing into our backs    I feel like those who have complained about the darkness of the hotel have overreacted yes the lobby is dark with lots of ambient lighting and disco balls and awesome music but the rooms were like any other Ive ever stayed in the majority of the light came from two end table lamps one torchiere and one desk lamp  The bathroom had adequate over the sink lighting and two or three ceiling lights   The bedroom was extremely clean  PS   the BED is AMAZING They really have something with the quotW Signature BedquotSome positives no one has mentioned The toiletries are from Bliss Body Butter face wash hand soap etc  They are quality products and they smell great The TV was HUGE LG LCD Flat screen    They change out the welcome mats in the elevator to say quotGood Morningquot and quotGood Eveningquot depending on the time of the day Hey its the small things that count   One last thing I think that they could offer Free WI Fi but we were so excited about exploring Chicago that we barely thought about emailI promised myself that I would write this review if we had a good experience and we had a GREAT experience Give the W City Center a try    You can find good deals out there and once youre at the hotel theyll take care of you    
P => dont stay here unless on business in the area The only reason to stay here is if you are on business because the price is not worth it if its coming out of your own pocket  The window to half the rooms overlooks an interior courtyard where it looks like they keep their garbage  Feels like an old run down tenemant building  And its near the el so you need to be a heavy sleeper or have strong sleeping pills to ignore the noisy train right outside your window  They nickel and dime business travelers for everything charging  to accept a fedex and  for sending an email using their scanner downstairs  The place is understaffed as well  Being on hold for a few minutes when ordering room service and what especially annoyed me was waiting on the phone for several minutes simply to ask them to bring my package up to me  Very annoying when I am getting billed  simply for them to receive the fedex for me  The few good things about this place are that the downstairs whiskey blue is very chic and trendy  The food is ent although does not meet expectations for a supposedly  star place  Although understaffed the staff tried hard and is very friendly when you finally can get a hold of someone  It seemed all the staff were always smiling friendly genuinely apologizing for the poor service and harried from running to put out one fire to the next  Bizarrely they always call your room several minutes after room servicepackage asking if everything is okay  It annoyed me that they kept interrupting on their own time to ask if they can do anything else instaed of just giving me the service I wanted when I wanted it  Also the reason this place is so busy is that there is a dearth of business hotels in the west loopunion station area  If there were another business hotel in this area Im sure the W City Center would go belly up  
P => you really have to love it I have stayed at many of the W hotels around the country NYC Atlanta LA Chicago Lakeshore etc  and the experience is often touch and go for me some things are great others not good  One small part of staying at any of these hotels is the fact that you really need to be in the mood for all of the music dimmed lights clever sayings written on each surface you encounter  I dont knock that they really do try to provide a different experience and it is good at night when you want to feel like something is going on  But I have to wonder why I just paid  for a dark room the size of my home bathroom with a tiny prisoners window  At this property I feel that the hoteliers put all of their money into a design sense and none of it into the basic comforts expected from an expensive hotel room  Lets first talk about the positive the staff in the bar was top notch the check in was straightforward and the hotel has a thriving vibrant feel when you enter and wind your way to the reception desk  But I spend most of my time at a hotel in the room preparing to sleep sleeping or finishing up some presentation document or emails at the desk before heading out to conduct the business for which I came to a given city  In this respect the rooms at W themselves have sometimes left me feeling a little disapointed and even worse uneasy  This uneasy feeling was the case for my most recent stay at the W City Center which was heightened by a really dark room  Window small X and hidden behind a large black TV armoir  Dark obvious stains on the douvet and sheets added a grimy dungeon like feeling that was enhanced by the dark surfaces and indirect flourescent lighting  The effect is a let down but also a strong desire for fresh air and a mild concern about the actual cleanliness of the room  It made me wonder why I was in this hotel when there are so many better lit spaces available for less money in downtown Chicago  It is always too late for me to change rooms or hotels after I arrive because time is limited so I thought I would share this and perhaps spare other business travelers the let down  
P => W For Wonderful  I had the pleasure of booking  rooms at the W Hotel at City Center in Chicago the weekend of   My mothersister who flew in from Phoenix AZ  and I went to celebrate my mothers th birthday and to see Jersey Boys which was fantastic I was a little concerned about the rooms after reading some of the reviews since my mother is  I thought the hotel be a little too eclectic for her but I must say we were VERY pleasantly suprised The staff was ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL I really want to give kudos to ALBERT JONES the front desk supervisor and SELAWE TAU the welcome desk manager they went above and beyond to see that our stay was TRULY WONDERFUL The only complaint I have about the hotel is that it is a little dark for our taste but I would definetly stay there again 
P => Would not stay here again    Stayed at the W for business the week of tember   Loud interior and exterior noise in the two rooms I stayed in   due to the train and the old buildings venilation  Called front desk at pm to find out when jack hammer noises would stop  Call never returned  Called back  min later and asked to speak with manager  Room was upgraded the next morning to a two bed room the next day  Second room was noisy as well  Would not stay here again    Too trendy and expensive for my taste  
P => Not for older travelers I got this room at the last minute on a holiday weekend  The room was very small and cramped and way too dark  The hallway smelled of liquor  I arrived a  AM and the music was so loud from the club I could not hear the desk clerk  The staff was very nice but the atmosphere was too quottrendyquot for this traditional traveler  Only place to plug in lap top was in the bathroom had to sit in the hall on the floor  
P => I always enjoy staying at this W Hotel  The W Chicago   City Center is always a great stay  I am greeted by name and the bar and hotel staff are always friendly  They have recently re done many of the rooms and my past few stays they have upgraded me at no cost each time  Again great stay and fun place  
P => Good Location Austin Powers Wet Dream       Great Hotel rather swanky accommodations friendly staff nice bonus that I was able use the car service from Acura  Really attractive bar staff  Heather and Matt at the front desk are super rad Only one negative the bathroom was quite small but I am a small person so Ha Ha to all you fatties 
P => Always trendy and top notch at the W I stayed here during a professional board exam not fun  The W made the stay productive and comfortable  There were areas to read ent place to workout cozy bed and a great bar and lounge  I have stayed in other Ws in New Orleans and San Fran  They are always trendy comfortable and fun  I like to bring my wife so we can enjoy the atmosphere  In this case I needed and was able to study socialize after the test get quick good meals either in the room or in the restaurant  Just what I needed during a stressful time  
P => W Chicago   City Center an Oasis At am after arriving late through OHare and sitting in an hour of traffic our quotpaidquot hotel room at another facility was given away  We got in a taxi and passed the W  Having stayed at W Hotels before and had great experiences we stopped and were welcomed with open arms  Our room was comfortable and staff exceptional  We always look forward to staying with W and the Chicago city center fulfilled all our expectations  
P => Too Cool W Picture this     You just walked  Chicago city blocks with luggage in tote from the train and you are greeted by the doorman with a quothelloquot and smile  As you proceed to the counter to check in you are surrounded with an eclecticchic and upscale view of the lobby  As you approach the counter you are greeted with YES MORE SMILES and asked if you would like a Freezer pop from a huge metal tub of ice with every flavor you can wish for     upon checking in you are given party beads for the holiday celebration in the city as you are directed to the elevators    when you arrive upstairs to your eclectic orated room and sit on the bed you know you are going to sleep very well If you can picture this in your mind then you should check out this hotel the or was newly changed from my  visit and everyone including the concierge and door man are extremely polite and helpful  the restaurant and bar are a HUGE must see and try it is a short walk from the train and in the middle of so many things to do and see       and dont worry if you forget anything there are plenty of items in the hotel room for sale picture mens breifs umbrella you name itthe beds are so comfy that I had to see what was under the sheets     there is a fabulous mattress topper that we actually ordered when we got home for our own bed We have never slept better in our lives at a hotel 
P => Great Service from the staff of the W hotel The W hotel on Adams Street is a wonderful environment for the business traveler  The employees at the hotel are very friendly accommodating and treat everyone with respect  Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone especially to the business traveler  
P => Enjoyed the W The lobby is eclectic  The bar is quothappeningquot on Friday nitesThe rooms are small but the beds are very comfy The bathroom was roomie Even though you can hear the quotLquot CTA it is not distracting more like white noise All of the staff members were great and helpful      we requested an upgrade and received without additional charge This hotel is located very near to the Macys on State Street and the Theatre District is within walking distance      
P => Good not great I was a little concerned about staying here as many people have noted issues with it  Turns out its a good W Hotel just not the best  The lobby is cool all goth and romantic looking  We had an early flight and tried to check in at  but they were sold out and wouldnt let us check in until   Steven who was so nice upgraded us to Spectacular rooms larger comfortable and orated in that grayblack theme  The location is so so being in the business area and close to the Art Institute but far away from the great restaurants  We ate at Ristorante We for breakfast and dinner and found it to be pretty good James our server was wonderful  One thing that bothered me about this W and also at the Dallas W was the WhateverWhenever desk person  She acted like she couldnt be bothered with our questions  I would like to see W Hotels improve on this its a service and there is no reason for these associates to be so snotty  Anyway I recommend the W Lakeshore thats a great hotel  This one is good but not great  
P => Worst W ever    As a business traveler Ive stayed at several W Hotels New York Seattle San Francisco and now Chicago  My experience at the City Center W in Chicago has been by far the worst  My original room was filthy  It was as if the cleaning service simply changed the sheets I hope and put in new towels  Upon my request for a new room I was put in a smoking room which was not much cleaner  I Will not stay here again  Also this hotel is in desperate need of updating I was told this will begin at the end of the year  As an FYI there are no views at this hotel if that is important to you  
P => Not the best experience but probably not representative    My company recently added a sales office in Chicago so I made the trip out from NY to Chicago  Our office is   blocks away from the W so I ided to book here instead of at the Westin the other approved hotel on the list where we get a special rate Ive had good experiences with W properties in the past San Diego Los Angeles Tuscany in NY so I expected something similar  It wasnt great The good news is that my original trip was canceled because of that horrendous NY area weather  My flight was canceled by air traffic control and I ended up calling the W at the last minute and telling them my predicament  To my surprise they waived the cancellation fee even though it had nothing to do with them  That was a big plus in my book The bad news is that when I made it out a week later the only smoking room available I smoke cigars and thought itd be nice to be able to smoke in the room was one with double beds  The beds were so soft that if someone told me that two elephants had sex in them the night before I would have believed you  That was really disappointing The condition of the room wasnt great either  scuff ks on the walls molding come off the base of the walls etc On the plus side room service was good the bucatini is phenomenal and generally prompt  the person who brought up my food the first night even went out of her way to give me a card with her name on it I travel a lot for business and so Im willing to chalk it up to a bad one off experience so Ill try it again in the future with the W  However Im staying at the Hard Rock Chicago next time to see what else is out there  
P => Modern and sleek accommodations  The W Hotel has a great location in a great city  The rooms are pretty basic but in a good way  I like the rather monochromatic color scheme of the room The best part is the lobby with background music and bar  Theres a good drink selection and really nice waitresses  I admit I tried quite a few options from the bar menu  But the good news was my room was just an elevator ride away The train is very close to the hotel  You can hear it but really not enough to bother you or disturb your sleep  
P => Not clean   has been orated for Halloween There was a strong smell of humidity in the bath room  The entire hotel is so freaking dark that you cant tell if the place is clean or not you should bring a flash light  The or is horrible   it looks as if it has been orated for halloween  The standard rooms are tiny    It was my first and last time in a W hotel  
P => W consistency   a good thing If youve stayed at a W before youll feel right at home here  Same or service menu amenities etc  All in all a safe pick for those who like contemporary design hotels  Also it is very convenient to the EL and the subway  Overall a good choice if you need to stay in the South Loop area  
P => Needs an update This W Hotel isnt as trendy and nice as it should be  Small rooms arent really a problem thats to be expected in a big city  The dark lobby and hallways arent too big of a deal if thats the look theyre going for  Yes its loud  The hotel is right on the El solution request a room quotfacing insidequot  No biggie Its just that the place feels tired When I mentioned that to a staffer he told me they have heard that from many visitors and the hotel is responding  He said they are about to begin a major overhaul of the entire place including changing the design think light and bright and adding more rooms That will be nice for the future but for now if youre in the hunt for hotel chic I suggest considering some other places A specific example The shower in our bathroom looked like it was made of institutional tile from the s  It wasnt retro just old and dismal About the service When I stayed here last ember I never opened the front door when I was entering the hotel  A staffer always saw me coming and opened the door  Certainly not required but a nice little touch  However on my most current visit the front door people were often talking amongst themselves and rarely opened the door One more thing when I thanked a staffer for being the only person to smile during my stay other desk person joked that quotWere too cool to smilequot  A joke indeed  
P => Not great Im just back from the W City Center  Dont bother unless you are something and love the scene  The hotel is dark the lobby the room the furniture  Ive stayed in one other W an it was nothing like this  The rooms are small and I had a room with a king size bed  If youre on the inside of the hotel  what they call the court yard I call it the alleyway you hear the constant noise of the train which is a block away   I agree with the other reviewer about the staff  The doormen were fine but the staff at reservations are all young with attitudes  If you have a choice stay at the Westin North  or on Michigan Ave or even the Sheraton  Dont bother with the W city center 
P => Worst hotel in my  years of travel Well in my  some years of business travel the stay in downtown Chicagos W Hotel Adams Street has to be one of my worst experienceI booked their so called quotSneakaway for a Summer Sleepover at W Hotelquot offer at  a night for  nights y    I know that the room will be a bit small they said   sq ft but the description said that it includes Breakfast in room Movie wine cooler sorbet and free access to the health club etc  etc  Although I had booked the Westin River North at  a night for a room twice the size AAA rate I ided to switch to the W Hotel because  their website shows really nice rooms and I thought it would be nice to try a W Hotel which I had never tried before and  the package includes breakfast which at Starwoods hotels usually would be about   anyways  Well that turned out to be a hotel from hell for me The room   is barely a  sq ft and the bathroom is so small that I have to turn sideways in order to access the toilet and I am a small person  When I sit down the toilet paper is right in my face right side and my left knee is touching the shower curtain  The carpet is dirty and there are no drawers for cloths except for  small drawers in the night table by the bed   When I checked in I was given some coupons for breakfast drinks and so on  When I took a closer look I discovered that the quotbreakfast couponquot is only for quotin room diningbreakfastquot there was no mention of that in their website  Also I only got  coupons when I was staying for  nights  So the next day I went to see the front desk and asked for a third coupon  The staff and then the manager told me that I should not have gotten the second coupon in the first place the package is ONLY for ONE breakfast for the entire stay  I said if the package says quotfree hotel parkingquot does it mean that it is only for  night or free access to the health club is it only for one night After much exchange he finally gave me a third coupon At the time I did not have access to look at what the website said and so I thought it merely says quotbreakfastquot   still quotbreakfastquot would mean daily breakfast  If they do mean ONE breakfast for the entire stay they should be up front and mention that  After I got home I checked into their ad again and viola it said explicitly quotdaily breakfastquothttpwww welcometowhotels comsleepawaycampIM SOP top WH WCAMPTo add insult to injury the coupon is for quotbreakfast for  peoplequot up to a maximum of    for in room dining  Their smallest coffee size is a carafe which is  pastry is  delivery charge   and service charge   for a grand total of    The pastry turned out to be ONE danish  So I wonder how can they even say that it is breakfast for  people for    unless they expect  people to share one danish pastry  Even though I stayed there by myself I still had to pay the extra   the amount over the  allowance  How can a hotel advertise quotdaily breakfast includedquot when one still has to pay When I couldnt access their wireless internet in my room I called their help desk first they transferred me to the IT help line which put me on hold for  mins so I hanged up  Called the help desk again and they said they would send someone to my room to help me  Well it turned out that this was a hotel maintenance guy who knows nothing about computer  He said he was there to make sure that I had my PC plugged in correctly Finally I got through to their help line and the person who answered told me that their wireless network does not support Linus platform  he could not send someone to my room or work on my PC because he is not in the hotel   that the support is outsourced So I said fine and stopped using the PC at the hotel  On the day before I cheked out I ran into a fellow in the elevator typing away on his notebook computer  I commented to him that I could not log onto the network  he said thats odd becasue he IS the IT manager at the hotel and he could check that right away for me  Well I was on my way out to dinner on the last day so what good is it for me to use my PC when I only have one more night to stay there Staff attitude well the help line staff and the doormen were very nice and courteous  But some staff at the concierge and the reception desk are not  One case in point the final bill incuded an item quotmini pakquot of   which I never used  When I checked out I said I had not charged anything called a mini pak and it souned like some snack in the room bar  I said that if I had used it I would have remembered  The staff replied quotwell even a bottle of our water is  so  is not that muchquot  I held my tongue instead of saying quotif a person is silly enough to spend  on bottled water heshe should be reborn in their next life in a third world countryquot  When I asked a concierge how far is the restaurant that I wanted to try and whether it is quotwithin walking distancequot he said quoteverything is within walking distancequot  A more courteous staff would say quotit is about xxx minutes walkingquot or quotit  be bettr to take a cab because it  take you about  minutes to walk therequotNormally I do not like posting negative messages on travel sites  A good customer should always talk to the establishment first and give them the chance to correct their mistakes  In this case I have talked to their manager  Their quotsurveyquot is going back to their downtown hotel rather than to W Hotel headquarter so I believe the so called survey is useless If anyone knows how can I get this message to W Hotel   higher up than the managers who hang out at the reception desk please let me know  
P => in the center of it all i loved this hotel  it was my first trip to chicago so i didnt know what to expect  upon walking in i was amazed by the lobby  it was large and ornate  there was a dj spinning since it was a friday night  the place was happening and definitely my speed  the restaurant is to the left which is a good dark meeting spot with friends before going out and hitting the town  there is a bar to the right  i was greeted to my room with a little bamboo plant in a vase a bottle of wine and cheesecrackers  nice touch  it was a welcome gift from a friend  the rooms were rather nice  of course what you expect from a W  stylish and modern nice bathroom freebies  they were on the smaller side but not too small  we had a double  the bathrooms were rather nice  there wasnt a view  there was no pool  but it did have a fitness room with treamills having their own private tvs the hotel is in the center of it all  close enough to michigan and shops  short cab ride to halstead the clubs and other bars  it was full of energy  it was trendy and happening defintely for the   crowd  but if you want a quiet hotel and peace and relaxation i wouldnt stay here  its full of energy music its full of life  
P => tiny tiny room I am a starwood preferred guest means nothing at this property and had the smallest room I have ever stayed at  The hotel is right next to the train so you get to hear that every few minutes  The staff was ok but there are so many other great places to stay in Chicago  Dont waste your time on this dog  
P => Great Stay Great Service Great Meal at We Had a great stay the weekend of    Great lobby vibe  Very nice Acura car service   we did not use but the car staff was very friendly  He said it was free Room was a Spectacular King and we had no complaints  Loved the iPod docking station and flat screen TV  Front desk staff room service wait staff at WE doormen and valets were first class Only negative is when we called down to the concierge for a dinner recommendation and he gave us the name and number of quotItalian Villagequot   this is a touristconventions goer type of restaurant and thankfully we did not go  Odd choice  Anyway we called TRU and were lucky enough to land a table for two  We also dined at quotWequot one night and the service food and wine were above average  The nice surprise was that the wine list had some unique wines at very fair prices and we were able to take an unfinished bottle upstairs to our room  Special kudos to our waiter Dan  who not only knew the wine list but all the movies Robert Redford ever starred in as well as some great theater recommendations to see while in Chitown Valet parking is  per night as it is everywhere so buyer beware Great location easy to hail a cab a short walk to the blue lines and loop el trains  These trains make it a little noisy but bearable  Thanks W  
P => Small and noisy rooms but great service This hotel has a great location in the Chicago Loop but it is VERY close to the tracks for the Chicago L the elevated railroad Chicagos version of a subway  All night I could hear trains rattle past my window    and I was on the th floor It was way too loud and I slept terribly As others have noted the rooms are quite small but small rooms are pretty much the norm for W Hotels and for hotels inside the Loop and to be honest the rooms at the W Chicago City Center are actually larger than the rooms at the W New York The staff was always very very helpful and attentive  They booked all sorts of restaurant reservations for me  They patiently gave me good directions to sights all over town  When something in my room broke and repairman came right by  Because I am a Starwood Gold member I was allowed to check out at  p m  So I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about the service The lobby is beautiful and quotcoolquot  I didnt try the restaurant so I cant comment on that  
P => W Whatever       W Hotels are what happens when a bunch of keting MBAs dont have enough to do and so management poses a question what DO cool edgy tech savvy young heroes with gobs of disposable cash want in a hotel The apparent answer puce and gray or young and edgy looking desk help and mini bars that offer baseball caps and quotintimacy kits quot Ah progress  It would be more fun were it not so transparently contrived  But then I am undoubtedly more curmudgeon than cool and edgy The W City Center has its plusses and minuses  On the plus side the location is excellent if business takes you to the city center area  The rooms though quite small are comfortable for a solo traveler  The bedding is first rate  The iPod ports are a nice touch  The staff is young and enthusiastic and tries hard to please  The building is an architectural gem with exceptionally nice lobby features somewhat obscured by poor lighting  The lobby bar is a nice place for an evening cocktail or morning coffee Minuses For starters puce and dark gray are maintenance nightes every mistake with a service cart leaves a noticeable plaster ding on a wall every laundering error creates fade ks and stains on comforters that began life in purple but are fading to oon  The result is that new stuff becomes old stuff quickly and W doesnt seem inclined or equipped to do much about it and so the rooms and corridors look more beat up than they should  It didnt help that the remote for the nice big screen tv didnt work The youth and enthusiasm of staff is pleasant but has the down side of inexperience and lack of training  Hence the concierge asked to obtain mens dress shirts to remedy a clothing emergency did not know the conventions of mens shirt sizing i e  that   by  means collar circumference and sleeve length in inches and the doormen didnt know how to locate a street address just a few blocks away  And heres news     if Ws brand identity is cool and edgy why is USA Today the only free daily paper I suspect cool and edgy types would prefer the local paper and Chicagos is better than most so they could find out what was going on in that toddlin town  In terms of value for the price the W stacks up relatively poorly against the competition     the week before I paid somewhat less to stay at the far superior Sofitel Water Tower Overall this is not a bad hotel but you pay more than you should for pretty basic stuff overdressed in Starwoods rather contrived notions of brand identity  
P => Good location but there are better hotel choices I booked the hotel through Hotwire and was expecting a basic room  I got exactly what I expected  the smallest hotel room in the United States The room I had Room  was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in some small rooms in Argentina and Europe  There was very little room between the bed and the desk and the entertainment cabinet  The bathroom was also vert small with no counter space to put toiletries  I had to keep everything in the travel bag after I used them The lobby was very nice during the day but at night it is like walking into a cave and it doubles as the hotel bar  I could barely see to make it to the elevator it was so dark and so crowded The front desk people are professional but they do not present the kind of service one expects in a  star hotel  I was offered an upgrade at   extra a night which I lined then the desk clerk said she would give me a room with a queen bed  However I was only given a room with a double bed and the W tried to charge me an extra   a night because they said I had upgraded  The woman at the front desk on Sunday morning was not helpful at all  Another problem I had was getting my car when I was ready to check out  Be warned  if you take a car and park in their parking lot the charge is   a night  If you are there on weekends you can actually park in front of the hotel or on LaSalle Street for free  We tried to call the number we were told to call and no one would answer  We then called the problem line and the man who answered said we would have to call the valet back he could not help  We called another number and this person tells us to come down to the lobby and just go to the parking valet with the claim check  This added an extra  minutes to the check out The W does have some nice features  the bedding was incredible we had  pillows and the soaps and shampoos were great  We tipped the maid and she gave us tons of extra towels and soaps  The hotel location was great  We walked to the Oriental Theater to see Wicked  the theater was about  mile away  We walked to the Art Institute which was about  blocks away and we walked to the Magnificent Mile  The El is a block away from the hotel  My room was across the street from the El and I never heard it at night My experience at the W was neither pleasant or unpleasant  I think it is a rather mediocre hotel  There are far better hotels with far better service for the same money and I would not stay there again  
P => Should have read Tripadvisor First   Treated like a Nuisance not a Customer Booked a quotWonderful Roomquot for a one night stay for a business trip  The hotels website states that a Wonderful Room is  sq  ft  with an oversize desk glass door rainforest shower and luggage rack  Checked in at  PM Wednesday and was given one of the four rooms in the far corners of the floor  Walked into the room   no desk and the tv cabinetmini bardresser unit was inches from the front corner of the bed so you had to turn sideways it get to the window or climb over the bed  No glass door shower  No chair  Furniture with peeling scraped veneer  Room was about as big as my wifes walk in closet I called the welcome desk to ask for a change  Was called back by quotGuest Servicequot and told no rooms were available but after I continued to complain he said he would check  He called back five minutes later and said no rooms were available and the hotel was fully booked  A lie I asked as it was only  PM had everyone checked in and he said yes another obvious lie  He said he could upgrade me for  When I protested he offered me a free breakfast  As I lined as I was attending a meeting he said would look again  While I waited I paced off the room and measured it at  sq ft  including bathroom closet windowsill etc  Also called the Starwood Hotels  Reservation number W is a Starwood Hotel and was told there were rooms available at all price points that night As no callback came in  minutes I called the welcome desk again and asked for the manager  I told the Welcome Desk attendant what the problem was  I was called back by another quotguest servicequot person who told me the hotel was quotfully committedquot and there were no rooms  He would not define quotfully committedquot  When I complained that the staff was rude he argued with me and said as he had not spoken to me yet he could not have been rude  Told him that there were rooms available he said the  number was overselling the hotel and that the room didnt meet the standards of the room I booked  He said he would look again Finally got a callback after a total of a wasted half hour and was moved to another quotWonderful Roomquot  It did have a desk oversize only as compared to a school desk and was larger but no glass door shower just an old tub and no luggage rack not a problem Ive been to quite a few cities and I have stayed at Sheratons and Starwoods and have been a member of the Sheraton Club since  but I have never been treated this way by hotel management and never so obviously lied to  It is among the worst customer service experiences I have ever had When I discussed it with the manager at checkout the manager Heather said the first room was considered a quotWonderful Roomquot and when I pointed out how it didnt meet what was on the website she had no response  So this means that the hotels website has false and misleading information On the positive side the hotel is well located and has free coffee in the morning  The bed was comfortable with nice linens soft towels in the bathroom with good amenities and a good clock radio with iPod dock  And contrary to another review there were  or  tv channels Lesson I learned Always read TripAdvisor reviews even if you are traveling on business  
P => Very very very small rooms My husband and I stayed at the W for one night on business  Pros  Clean comfortable bed and pillows  Close to the quotElquot   can walk to a stop in seconds  Attentive front door staff  Prompt room service  ent gymCons  Very small rooms  This was by far the smallest room Ive ever stayed in  There was so little space between the bed and the desk that if you want to pass by you have to push the chair in AND walk sideways  There was so little room on the floor   the only place to put your suitcase was in the small closet  If you have more than one suitcase good luck  There is only one chair so only one person could eat room service food on the table  I had to eat on the bed  There was only one window and this made the room feel even smaller   Very small bathroom  It was so small I knocked toiletries off the counter while putting a robe on  The sink basin itself was so small that while washing my face much of the water went onto the sink counter  If two of you need to get ready good luck   Terrible room service food  My husbands burger was very mediocre  The fries were soggy  My steak sandwich was rubbery and the bread was like cardboard  There is a McDonalds down the block and a Starbucks and Seven Eleven around the corner   those are your better bets for quick meals and snacks and inexpensive sodas   Because the quotElquot was so close we could hear it very loudly until late at night and very early in the morning  Bring earplugs or ask for a room away from the quotElquot line   The lobby looked like a night club  Very dark lit only by small candles and a light show on the wall  Techno music played constantly  After a long flight this was really annoying   The TV was nice but had very few channels  I had more channels visiting the Caribbean   We requested a late check out but housekeeping knocked at  AM  Apparently the front desk didnt communicate our request to housekeeping staff It seems as though this hotel sacrificed comfort in an effort to be chic and trendy  If staying in a trendy place is important to you if youre travelling solo and if you bring only a small bag youd probably like it here  If you like space dont enjoy bumping into furniture and dont enjoy pretentiously trendy places stay elsewhere  
P => Not bad if you are traveling solo I just checked out of this hotel  hours ago  Overall impression Pretty good  A solid quotB minusquot Room Small It was a bed and a few feet on each side  Bathroom  x   Including the tub  It was a tad biggerthan an airline bathroom  Not kidding  Bed Comfortable lots of pillows big comforter Internet biggest complaint They are STILL on ethernetand it cost  a day I strained to get the cord into my laptopand it was such a hassle for three days  I tend to surfthe net on my laptop in bed not at a desk  For  a dayshould have been wi fi  my first night at a Holiday Innhad FREE wi fi Temperature of room WARMIt was  degrees outside at nightand I left the window open so that I could use the bedding  This meant that when I got up in the nightI froze but the bedding was warm  At  am whenthe truckstraffic started up I gave up Shut the windowand kicked off the covers   I couldnt control the tempin the room at all except by opening the window  Bars Nice Expensive Vibe Very Euro Gothic purple andvelvet  Look for Prince I know hes hiding behindthe big palms  Techno or Parisian trance music played If you listen closely you can hear the click click of Princesheels as he scurries around in the dark Gothic corners behind the  curtains  Staff Very nice always helpful  Breakfast to the room Expensive and just so so  I cant believe what I paid for what I got  Carpet in Halls thread barren  Ice No sign I wandered the halls and knocked on doors  just kidding I opened all doors that did not have a roomnumber and finally found an ice machine  th floor  Would I stay again be if the price is right  cheapThe location is a bit far from the Michigan Ave shoppingbut cabs were always waiting  The hotel is in the Financial district and not much goingon at night or weekend  Many places were closed onthe weekend  I enjoyed the quotenergyquot and the cool interiors  If it werenot for that I would not have been happy at all  How could they improve Wi Fi in roomsFix HVAC issues in roomsUpdate halls and signageI stayed here as another hotel about  years ago They should have gutted the whole thing when Starwoodbought the property and remodeled from the ground up a 
P => The W Hotels You Either Luv em or Hate Em Lucked out on Priceline and got a good rate   and for what we paid The W Chicago Center was pretty ent  By reading the other reviews you can sort people into either quotlove the Wquot or quothate the W quot The style of most W hotels isnt some folks cup of tea  We actually found the room quotbigquot by W and urban hotel standards Pretty chic and interesting  Most W or is usually pretty IKEA ariffic small desks you cant use petite furniture etc  Best part was the bathroom and the bed  I would rate this hotel one of the larger room and more functional W hotels Ive stayed at  Its worth checking out especially if youre kinda hip and like something a little trendy  
P => nice but small rooms good location but expensive for the money Rooms are small but well equipped and the design is pretty nice  the whole hotel is kinda dark so if you like big hotel with lots of spacelightsun this is not for you  the lobby could be a night club dark cool design   Concierge was helpful  a bit pricey though  
P => W works for me Compact rooms   but well appointed  Clean  Very styled as you would expect from the W  No issues with heat as mentioned in other reviews  I asked for a room away from the El or street noise and then had no issues  Two breakfasts and a dinner at Ristorante We and was very pleased with food and service  No issues there as mentioned in other reviews  Breakfast served quickly  I love the granola with berries and yogurt  Coffee is great and they give you a full carafe Staff at the hotel was courteous and helpful  Great location if you are traveling for business and need to be near Sears Tower Loop etc  
P => Great Urban Getaway My partner and I stayed at the W City Center over the holidays leading up to New Years  When considering price the City Center was considerably less than the Lakeshore Drive location  We got an upgrade from a Wonderful room to a Spectacular room and be warned it wasnt that Spectacular  it was Standard size  A nice room nonetheless just not a noteable upgrade  The staff was friendly and accommodating  The lobby as always provides a hip backdrop for casual cocktails in an urban setting  Many sights are nearby Millenium Park or just a short walk or cab drive Magnificent Mile museums etc   If youre familiar with the W brand and like the style and comfort and all the W offers you wont be disappointed  
P => It was OK City Center is a typical W in that the rooms are small but comfortable  City Center is in the quotloopquot i e  business district so there is not a lot going on there after pm on a weekday or weekends  I lived in Chicago for several years so I know how to get around but if youve never been to Chicago or do not have friends there I wouldnt recommend City Center  As far as the hotel was concerned the service was ok  The thermostat in my room did not work so the room was quite stuffy and unfortunately it was the athon weekend so they were booked and couldnt move me  The walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors as well as everyone in the hallway As always great Bliss Spa products  Overall the hotel is old the rooms are small and the location isnt great although it is centrally located if you want to take a cab or walk  blocks down to Michigan Ave  Its also close to the El  
P => Average Hotel I stayed in this hotel for  nights while in Chicago for work  The location of the hotel was excellent for me as it was within walking distance of where I needed to be everyday  There did not seem to be a whole lot of other hotels in the immediate area so for this reason I am glad that I stayed at the Hotel However aside from the location the hotel did not offer much that would make me want to return  The room I stayed in was extremely small  And the noise from the hallway neighboring rooms and elevated train was extremely loud  While I did appreciate the idea of the design for the hotel it seemed a bit worn and cheap  
P => worth it for the price My wife my  year old son and I spent three nights at this property in late ember  we were in town to go to Shed Aqu  and Field mus The property was reasonable clean everything functioned and the house keeping staff did a very nice job  We did not eat on site or use the health club facility as the property is so close to many restuarants and shopping areas  blocks off Michigan that we spent little time in the room  My only two complaints were that the parking was quite expensive at  per night  It did include in and out service but when the romm was  per night seams too much to self park your car  Other complaint was that the heat in the room was very inconsistant either too hot or too cold and VERY dry  In sumy the location is great the lobby was very nice and the room and bath room were clean functional and well serviced The room size was comfortable for  of us  Would have liked to have had a frig in the room but oh well    In general it was certainly adequate for the rate but dont expect a  star experience   but then again youre not paying for it  Id definately stay here again assuming the rate remained in this range as we typically spend little time in the room when we travel except to shower and sleep  However Id likely try someplace else if the rate moved much higher   
P => Would Definitely Go back I got this hotel through Priceline so I knew little about it  After reading some reviews here I wondered if Id been stuck with a bad deal and worried that Id have to apologize to my fellow travellers  However in the end we all three were quite happy with our stay and each of us would gladly stay here for a return visit The hotel has a very hip feel to it  this impression gets you first thing because the lobby doubles as a cocktail lounge low couches house music playing etc  The or in the hallways and the well appointed rooms carries this theme out  It doesnt seem like your typical hotel and even though its a big place and part of a chain it had the feel of a boutique hotel We had rooms with one queen bed each  The rooms are small but well laid out and ours were very clean  Our rooms faced West Adams and we could hear the El we were on the th floor but I considered that local ambience  We loved the bliss bath products nice showerheads and the provided robes We found the staff to be courteous and helpful  I worried that my Priceline arrangement might earn us second class status but check in was a delight  We appreciated the concierge service they printed our boarding passes for departure for example and found the doorpeople to be very attentive and friendly The hotel is in a lovely location for State Street shopping and the theatre district  Its not a bad walk to the Art Institute either  The only real drawback we encountered is that its location in the financial district meant that some of the coffeeshops and other area restaurants were closed on Sundays  it made breakfast that morning a challenge after we wandered out on our own without asking for guidance  Some people might not like the nightclub feel of the lobby at night  it can be crowded and noisy we didnt mind All in my party thought the W was a nice distinctive and memorable place to stay  Thanks W  you made me look good  Ill be back  
P => nice and cosy I stayed at the W  weeks for profesional reasons Well the hotel is really nice Its target customers are young profesionals or young touristsWhen I arrived at the hotel at midnight on sunday night I was welcome with technolounge music which was cool The room aren t really big but nicely furnished You ll get a stupid giant stuffed plum on your bed lolThe bad points are  the shower head is original but not convenient at all I had issue with the heat in my room which was sometimes not working  it s an issue especially in Chicago in winter    Avoid a room close to the elevators and ask for a room far from the quottrainquot Quincy station is at  minute so if you have a room on the bad side you ll hear the train coming and leaving the station luckly it stops at midnight It is not that loud but it can be very annoying Good points  you get Bliss products for showera shampoo a conditioner a bodycreama face wash a soap Everythin from Bliss 
P => I loved it I stayed there the weekend of ember nd and I loved it I was my second time staying there and the staff remembered me  The entire crew in the bar is awesome and the place is magnificent I highly recommend that you check this place out It is very hip 
P => Best hotel stay ever First of all I do not know how anyone could not give this hotel an excellent rating  Everything was amazing from the moment my wife and I walked in the door on our honeymoon  Although it can be expensive the W is the neatest trendiest hippest establishment Ive ever seen  From the atmosphere to the attitudes of employees everything was great My wife and I were greeted by  or  doormen who were very kind and helpful  We checked in for our honeymoon only to find out that we had been upgraded to a suite that would normally cost night  The suite was beautiful  big rooms and  bathrooms plasma TV chaise lounge chair and great couch  The room was beautiful  The room service was excellent  One night my wife and I in our mid s went to see Wicked and when we returned the hotel had Champaign waiting for us along with chocolate dipped strawberries at no cost We could have not asked for a more romantic and exciting hotel The lobby was always busy with young professionals hanging out with drinks from the Whiskey Blue or from the bar in the lobby  The attached Ristorante Wes food was delicious but yet a little expensive at  for two People that complain about this hotel are either just boring people or old and cranky  My new wife and I had the hotel stay of our lives Thanks W  
P => Not that impressed I was in Chicago for the athon and stayed at the W for my last night in town because I was able redeem Starwood points for a free night  Although Ive been a Starwood member for a long time and stayed at many St  Regis Sheraton amp Westin hotels around the world this was my first time at a W so I was excited to see what the quotW experiencequot was all about What I likedAlthough I arrived about am they had my room available and I was able to check in which was great  The front desk clerk was very friendly  The room was a bit small but fine  The bed was very comfortable  I ended up ordering dinner from room service the prices were about what you would expect but the dinner was surprisingly delicious  I think this is the first room service meal that Ive ever really enjoyed  I had the flatten grilled chicken ceasar salad and tiramisu for dessert What I did not likeThe train is very close to the hotel and although that makes getting around very convenient you can also really hear it rumbling by every  minutes or so which is not that pleasant  My room was a corner room with two huge window that looked directly into office buildings across the way so I had to keep the curtains closed most of the time  I know it goes with the quothipquot vibe of the hotel but it is so dark in all the public areas and even in the room that it makes it hard to see I guess that is a sign that I am now officially quotoldquot  One of the quotwhatever wheneverquot concierges was not very helpful and had a bit of any attitude when I ask her for train directions  The concierge who was on duty the next day was great and helped me check in for my flight online and printed my boarding pass for me so I guess its just a matter of who is manning the desk  Overall it is very quotloungyquot feeling but that is what you would expect when you stay at a W  I much preferred the Hilton on S  Michigan Ave which I stayed at the two previous nights  
P => Seemed a bit warn down I was disappointed in our recent stay at the W  We were booked for a superior King room and ended up with a fourth floor queen room  The drain in the bathtub did not work properly  We had a view of the ventilation system  The positives the lobby was pretty cool  They use Bliss Products  
P => Loved the W My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend businesspleasure trip  It was amazing Yes it feels like a nightclub when you enter but we thought it was unique and fun  All interactions that we had with the staff were excellent   everyone was really friendly and helpful  The room was small definitely but it just wasnt that big of a deal to us especially with so much to do in Chicago  The location is great   only about  blocks to the Art Institute restaurants and the Mag Mile The bed was AWESOME  We had all intentions of getting up early and going to the museums but couldnt drag ourselves out until  Our only issue was a couple of nasty servers in the bar on Friday night  No big deal really we just avoided them In all our stay was phenomenal and Id completely recommend the W City Center  
P => The W worked well for us Please read  Ok guys  I travel often I expect a lot and am very picky  I wrote a review on this website about Hotel Costa Verde in Costa Rica and tore it to shreds  I have no problem being honest Honestly I was impressed with the W  Its a  star hotel that I payed   bucks for using priceline  I was able to check in early and was treated like royalty  The young lady who checked me in Helen was extremely polite and fast  She offered me an upgrade to the quotcourtyard viewquot but was very fast to tell me that there is no view its just a bigger bed  She also said that its quiter in that part of the Hotel due to the train  The lobby was kept up nice and had some ent technotrance playing in the lobby  A far cry from quotobnoxiousquot which is how another writer described it  In fact its very low key and in the backround  Not loud at all  The room  was exactly what I would expect      A small bathroom yes but the room itself was fine  Very comfortable bed big enough TV and very neatly orated  Very modern and sleek  There was some music playing on the CD player when we entered the room  My wife didnt care for it so we turned it off  It was that easy My wife commented on the deoderizer they used in the room  It smelled goood but was indeed strong Checkout went smooth  My wife and expect a lot and were hesitant to even walk into the Hotel after reading the reviews on this website  However I had a pleasant experience there  A for me  
P => Near Clairvoyant Service with the Warmth of Cool Style At first glance the special convention rate I paid  seems high but it was not much different from rates for other Chicago city center hotels during my meeting at McCormick Place  Indeed the rate seems low taking into account the hotel s level of service far surpassing what I ve experienced at Ritz CarltonFour Seasons and its rekable style typified by the title of the CD in each room The Warmth of Cool My ultra speedy checkout exemplified the near clairvoyant service that anticipated my needs again and again  Despite the early hour  am the clerk was right there at the desk  He drew my attention to the part of the bill where I was going to look  When he saw my bags he asked right away about a taxi  By the time I left his desk a taxi was already at the door and my bags were being loaded  Outstanding service was everywhere I turned  The clerk at the gift shop took the time to play and discuss CDs on sale  When I returned to the gift shop another clerk remembered my interest in the toiletries the W stocks Bliss products good enough that I ve bought a supply for home use The hotel s hip but welcoming style is there as you walk in the door and notice a special scent and a set of flower arrangements unlike anything I d seen elsewhere  The lobby s architecture is a sort of neoclassical style but with low lighting candles near the front desk computer terminals help the clerks read and with abstract multicolored changing designs projected on the walls  My room was small but it seemed snug rather than cramped  A limited palette gave it a comforting feel and storage was abundant drawers in each nightstand and in the closet which also had a hanging cloth storage rack  One day I found a complimentary bottle of water in an attractive Voss container  Even the business center conveniently located just off the lobby is stylish dominated as you might expect by Apple computers  There was no charge for me to use one to look up my return flight and print out my boarding pass  For me the location worked out well  Only one hotel is near McCormick Place most meeting goers must rely on the meeting bus system as I did  The hotel is barely a block from the Quincy elevated train  L  station  From landing at Midway Airport and then retrieving checked luggage to the hotel via Orange Line took me only an hour  The Quincy station has a lot of steps a narrow turnstile and no elevators that I saw so it s not a good choice for those with a lot of luggage  I could use the L to travel elsewhere in Chicago and taxi rides to many of the top restaurants are not long  From my room I occasionally heard the roar of the L trains  It didn t disturb my sleep in a very comfortable bed but it might bother others  The hotel is in the financial district with little activity after  pm some might prefer a hotel in the shopping oriented Magnificent Mile of North Michigan Avenue  Keep in mind that there is another W Hotel in Chicago the W Lakeshore in a completely different location  Almost adjacent to the hotel are a McDonald s a Starbucks and a Walgreen s but the Walgreen s closes at  pm  The W is not for the fussy  My CD player tended to skip when I closed a drawer in the nightstand on which it rested  There s a DVD player that was easy to use but the tv is not flat screen  An outlet in the lamp made it easy to plug in my computer but I needed an adapter to use that single outlet to recharge both my Palm and my cell phone simultaneously  The desk was roomy but there were a couple scuffs  An orange brown spot perhaps a patch was evident in the tub  One of the light switches at the door didn t seem to operate anything  I reported this to the desk  A day later it still didn t seem to operate anything but a ceiling light in the bathroom previously nonfunctional was on and I couldn t figure out how to turn it off  The view was nothing but gray building walls  The fitness center has aerobic equipment with individual televisions and headphones but the view is just the walls of the adjacent building If I return to Chicago for a stay where the location makes sense and my budget can handle the rate the W City Center s utterly extraordinary level of service and unparalleled style will put it on top of my list  
P => Loved it mostly Ok I agree that it is really dark inside   like walking in from the street into a nightclub  We booked through priceline for a girls weekend away and got a HUGE room with  double beds  The beds are very soft and comfy Bliss toiletries in the bathroom coffee machine only arrived after requested   but in less than  mins  Steps away from orange line El train Quincy stop Sears tower and water taxi at union station  Location was a little more quotdowntownquot than we had hoped for but thats the risk with bidding on priceline inroom internet costs day but is free wifi in the lounge and balcony at ground level  Conceirge was not knowledgable about transport and wanted to send us to ClarkLake for elevator access lots of luggage   whereas washington station    stop further than Quincy and only  blocks down from hotel  has an elevator  
P => Average everything except the price which was very expensive A group of us spent  nights at the W City Center in early tember  Let me be totally honest the place is very hip and very cool  The lobby is beautiful and well appointed  There are beautiful flowers and candles everywhere as well as a very cool video show that is shot from a projector onto the massive walls  In the lobby every detail is cared for perfectly  When you enter a mat outside the hotel welcomes you with the specific time of day i e  Good morning in the morning and the mat is changed in the evening to say Good Evening  Upon check in we were offered a cocktail almost immediately which I found unique  At check in we were advised that our room booked through Priceline contained one full size bed and that in order for the room to sleep the two grown men sharing it we woudl need to pay an upgrade fee of  a night  Come on who would expect two buddys on a football cavation to stay in the same bed  The front dest clerk was wearing a suit jacket with what appeared to be a dirty Nike t shirt underneath  We proceeded to the upgraded room and it was fine but nothing special  I suppose teh PRiceline room was previously a closet based on the upgraded room size The hotel is conveniently located near the orange line L so transportatoin is easy On night  of our stay we went to the hotel bar about  a m  or so  When we tried to order a drink the snappy female bartender motioned her hand horizontally across her neck and shouted quotwere donequot  I asked the occsional W person floating around the room what time the lounge closed and he indicated  a m  Not sure why you cant get a drink in  minutes but in any event the cry of quotwere donequot is certainly less than welcoming All in all the stay was well below average and well below expectations for a hotel of this nature  Others have said it before and it is exactly true there is a reason the W in Chicago is ranked   out of  area hotels  Finally at check out one of our two rooms had an incorrect bill which took  minutes and two additional bills to straighten out  
P => Awful Service Small Rooms Went there early ust on business  Was really not impressed despite the reputation of the W hotels Check in was noisy arrived late at night and check in desk is right beside the barRoom was really tiny for the price they charge  Found a ridiculous giant stuffed apple toy on the bed Whats up with thatBest for last I tested what they call their quotWhatever Wheneverquot service  Ordered a simple omelet at am via room service  Was told on the phone that it would arrived at am  At am I call and the guy on the phone tells me that quottheyre struggling in the kitchenquot At am For an omelet Same guy went to check w the kitchen staff called me back and tells me they can PROBABLY deliver in  min I cancelled the order  No apologies the next day  Nothing  In  words Pathetic service  Even sent an email to their quality manager  Never heard back Please trust Trip Advisors ranking  out  for that type of hotel tells you everything you need to know  I will stick to what I know next time Sofitel is where its at when it comes to service  Chicago is great though  
P => strange hotel Many of the rewiews here say this is good hotel it is very strange    I stayed in this hotel for  nights  The hotel is dark which is very distubing  It is like horror movie scene  It is not clean  There is train rail near hotel so in the midle of the night you  wake up because of the noise  what ever whenener is incomletequotwhatever whenever as long as we make money from it quot If you go concierge for help they try to sell something to you  Becarefull about inroom massage service it is very disturbing  The massage oil smells very bed  The threarPist is dirty  
P => Very nice experience My husband and I booked this hotel for our anniverary in y  and TOTALLY loved the experience  The staff was nice and very accomodating  The ambience and the quothipnessquot of the hotel were not lost on us either  The beds were to die for 
P => Entertaining so far This hotel is not really my style  It is very contemporary but the beds are so very comfortable    so thats great The quotLiving Roomquot about blew my teen kids away  They think that its the bomb What I have loved so far     Chris the guy out front who helped us bring up our bags  Hes awesome and friendly    made friends with my son and even called us to tell my son that they were filming the new Batman downstairs and that he should come down and watch the filming  That was cool  We got to see quotGothamquot Police Dept  cars on the street  Apparently theyll be filming all night I also forgot my computer power cable and Jeff the concierge called around and helped me find one  That was a godsend  Im working on my Masters Thesis and really would have been in bad shape without it All in all this is not a great shopping destination hotel but were easy walking distance to Lollapalooza and thus the Art Museum and theatre district  Very comfortable  Very nice P S  Thanks W staff  Youve made this a nice experience  
P => A Pleasure My husband and I and our  year old son stayed for two days  The big mistake was buying through Priceline com  Even though I requested a room to sleep  we were booked into a room with one double bed and no room for a rollway  I wonder why they ask how many people will be staying if the chosen room can not accommodate that number of people That will the last time I use Priceline com The front desk woman at the W Chicago Kinga sp was wonderful  She solved our dilemma by giving us a king size room with a rollaway for no additional cost  She and the rest of the staff at the W were awesome The door was always manned and opened for us  Brian was especially friendly and concerned about us  We so much enjoyed the attention and special treatment In terms of our room it turns out we were given the model room the first and thus far only remodeled room in the hotel  We LOVED the bed and pillows and the LCD TV screen  The soaps and scrubs in the bathroom were great I have never been provided with a facial scrub and loved it  Oddly the bathroom door was sliding glass   yes you can see through it   and it did not actually close completely if you want everyone to know what you are doing in there this is the place  Unfortunately sitting on the toilet was a problem since the leg of the sink was only an inch away from the edge of the seat  I dont think that red k on my hip has disappeared yet o  The towels were plush and the closets sufficiently sized  The hallways however are too dark  As a woman I was uncomfortable walking through the halls day or night and would not let my son go to the ice machine alone All in all we loved the W  It was a great experience at a place we could not ordinarily afford  
P => Very nice experience worth it overall I wound up at the W City Center after a bizarre mappingbooking mistake that had me stuck out in Wheeling about  miles from Chicago not really that far but it felt like it  I spent  nights at the W and enjoyed my stay quite a bit Here are the pros and cons from my perspectivePros  I stayed on the th floor it was quiet and peaceful and even the elevated train didnt disturb my sleep   No children Awesome   ent fairly quick room service not cheap though   Nice king sized bed   Terrific robes  LCD TV  Sure beats the old CRTs you usually get at hotels   Good location within the city easy walking distance to Millennium Park some restaurants the river etc   Helpful desk staff ent hotel or a fine site overall Cons  The towels sucked I am afraid to say   Internet access isnt free and it isnt cheap   The AC works fine but it was either on too much or not enough   Slightly small room but it was fine Verdict  Id stay here again  Late  PM checkout is great   Consider bringing your own pillow and towels     
P => The W City Center is Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde My stay at the W City Center was a Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde type ordeal  For every task that they did well there was an equal and opposite task that flopped  As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from  stars to  stars  And lately I have been having good solid experiences booking  star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect but I was wrong I rated my experience at the W a quotquot but it was closer to a quot quot and just like in math class I rounded down  I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings but for service the W City Centre is a solid quot quot but thats as good as it gets My flight landed at Midway at about  am so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around  am  I was expecting to check my luggage but to my surprise I was able to check in  And according to them they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the th floor so that noise from the quotLquot wouldnt bother me  What a joke My bed wasnt even a full it was more like a double    be even a twin and a half  My wife and I who sleep in a King at home were practically on top of each other  And the courtyard view looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn  And I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that but please dont tell me its an upgrade when it really isnt  I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world than to feel like I was in prison The room was tiny After I learned was staying at the W I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small but the website doesnt do the room justice  There was exactly enough room to turn around but that was about it  there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed  When you pulled the chair out to take a seat it hit the foot of the bed so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair  At quot  lbs Im not a huge man but it was a feat for me to do that The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it  And the question that kept running through my mind was quotIf this is a  star hotel where is the plasma TVquot I have stayed at many other  star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TVs in its rooms  I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room  But it was a too small for my laptop The bathroom was also very tiny but it had a full sized tub and a fantastic shower head  Also the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full sized versions  The toilet was extremely noisy but I believe I figured out why  The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet but I think it was so that all quotdebrisquot could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once  I mean its so loud the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night The service at the door was great but it came in spurts  At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door but at others there might not be any only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and hes busy then youre stuck I didnt see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically The location is ent  Youre very close to the Orange and Brown line trains two blocks from the Blue line and  or  blocks from the Red line  And unless youre going out at midnight like we did there is usually a cab in the vicinity Overall this is not a  star hotel  You either have great service or none at all and I didnt appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit  I ided not to patronize the restaurant Shikago or bar Whiskey Blue because there are many other places in Chicago Id rather spend my money  Please do your research  The W City Center is a great    star hotel  Its not even close to being  stars  
P => Unique hotel experience loved it My mother and I stayed here for a brief weekend trip to Chicago  We tried out Priceline for the first time bidding   The W accepted the bid and at first I was concerned about the negative reviews  However I must say we were treated very nicely from the moment we checked in and even though booking at a discounted rate  They did give us the wonderful room on the th floor and it was pretty small  But nothing compared to small New York City hotel rooms so we managed for two days sharing a double bed and a small bathroom  In the morning they leave you the paper at your door and with Au Bon Pain located on the next block breakfast is a snap  The hotel has a dark sophisticated or which is a nice change from the typical family style hotel chain like riot or Hilton  Also we liked the Bliss bath products  The lobby always had coffee or tea or cucumber water available for guests  Or the bar was always there the Whiskey Blue was kind of happening on Friday night  Theres also a good cheap bar at the Elephant Club bar a few blocks to the left on W  Adams  We parked at the Union Station parking garage for  per night and walked with our bags for a few blocks to save money over the valet parking  The bonus is there were street vendors set up selling discount sunglasses forand jewelry on the way  There was quite a bit of a walk from the hotel to see all the sites  The first day we walked from the hotel to Buckingham fountain to Navy Pier up the riverfront down Michigan avenue and back to the W   and since I was wearing my pedometer I know that I walked  steps that day  But after that my feet were ready to fall off so we took cabs to go out to Rush amp Division to hit the club scene  
P => Awesome for Business   Terrible for Pleasure I had great expectations for this hotel Chicago is a wonderful city and I was really hoping to stay in a hotel that reflected its charm  HOWEVER if you are travelling with your family this is not the hotel for you I made the critical mistake of bringing my three year old and this hotel does not appreciate children  Normally I dont care if a hotel doesnt cater to children  Ive brought my child to hotels that are mostly for adults because he is well behaved and doesnt mind entertaining himself it never before was a problem  The staff made it obvious that they didnt appreciate children being there and made it a point to not accomodate my interests regarding matters with my child i e  crib in the room etc   I found the staff to be totally incompetant and obstinate  I needed a new comforter because I spilled on the original one  it took EIGHT phone calls to get a new comforter  After the fourth call I asked to speak with a member of management and it still took four more phone calls before I got the comforter and even then it wasnt the right size  I finally gave up  In the end I waited over two hours for a replacement comforter  Moreover if you are picky about cleanliness  beware some  not be impressed with the level of cleanliness of this hotel I ate an candy bar out of the snack bar and was revolted at how stale and old it was  It had probably been there for over a year  I sat in the bar and waited almost a half hour before being approached by the bartender  This was at  in the afternoon with only four other patrons in the bar   I wont stay at this hotel again  And I definitely wouldnt recommend it unless youre there for a quicky business trip I dont like sounding so negative in my travel reviews but this hotel could have done a lot better and I just want people to know that for a four star hotel it left much to be desired    
P => Great hotel   not real family friendly We stayed at the hotel for  nights  I brought my family and met other family for a weekend stay in Chicago  I had booked through Priceline so the selection of hotel was made for me  I was a bit leary of the hotel after reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised after our arrival  The rooms were great and easily accomodated everyone  The staff was excellent and most helpful  My nieces ages  and  thought the hotel was very cool and loved it  While everything was great   room service amenities     I would say I would not recommend for families with young children  The lobby is dark and in late afternoon and evening you need to walk through usually a crowd of people usually drinking cocktails    so a bit awkward when with kids  Also the quotelquot is located super close  This makes it very convenient for getting around town but a bit noisy at night  Overall we really liked the W Chicago and would especially recommend this locale for younger set  
P => Love It The W does it again  This hotel is amazing The lobby is low lit with beautiful flowers and scents  They offer different teas throughout the door to help relax their visitors  The staff is polite and professional  The rooms or is fun and chic  Flat screen television and dvd players in each room  The beds are comfortable and thick dark curtains line the windows to help keep your room dark and cool for those who need to sleep in  Overall I enjoyed my stay  The room service was great and the food was fabulous  I highly suggest this to anyone who wants to get away  It is located to many shops and restaurants but keep in mind Center City Chicago is mostly businesses and things close early  It is a hotel meant for relaxation and few distractions  It was perfect for my boyfriend and me during our two year anniversary  
P => For the price   head somewhere else stay somehwere else for the price   shabby rooms dark hallways lobby so loud with music the nice reception people were almost yelling to be heard  We wont return to this location 
P => Not bad not great Stayed for two nights in late ch  st night was in a Wonderful room  very small with my wife and I sharing a full sized bed  Bathroom is more of a lavatory  We asked and were upgraded the following night to a MUCH nicer room Spectacular  Good size comfortable bed and couch adequate space for  people to unpack their bags  or is nice  Workout facility also good  A nice but not spectacular stay  We have had better luck with the Westin brand in general  
P => Gotta Love the W We visited Chicago in ober  when we were in town for the Chicago athon  I believe we booked our room via discount internet outlet but cannot be sure of which one so I hesitate to name it here  This particular W Hotels location Chicago City Center could not have been more fantastic for pur purpose   we were within a few blocks of the startfinish line  But it was also a fabulous location for simply exploring the city   we were easily able to walk a few blocks to the train to local shopping the historic shall Fields now a Macys and to Michigan Avenue with the gorgeous parks and best public art in the world The Sears tower was minutes away in the opposite direction  Our room was absolutely tiny but very cute and comfortable  The service at the hotel was amazing as to be expected and the concierge was nice enough to recommend and book a massuer for my bfriend after the athon  If I ever have unlimited funds I will definitely look into staying at the W again 
P => Great stay I was a little apprehensive after ready some of the reviews for this hotel but was glad I went through with the stay  Found the staff helpful  Front desk gave us an upgraded room usually not possible when booked at a discounted rate  We had a corner room with a king size bed  The room size was a pleasant surprise for an older downtown hotel  Very comfortable  The bed was incredible  Probably one of the nicest beds I have every sleep on during a hotel stay  Hotel was clean and the lobby area was incredible  Open space great or with plenty of comfortable seating available  The kind of lobby you make a point to hang out in for a few drinks before you head out for dinner  
P => Whatever Whenever is on their terms I stayed there with my boyrfriend for business and have to say that the service is horrible  The hotel is chic and the employees greet you with a smile but that is about all you get  There is nothing behind the smiles and design of the hotel  The hotel messed up on delivering messages in room massages and room service just to mention a few things  All in all there motto quotWhenever Whateverquot is based on the hotel  There motto should be slightly changed to I will listen to whatever I want to and come through with the arrangement whenever I want to  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Excellent The W Chicago is an excellent accommodation choice inside the Loop  The W Hotels brand is best known for contemporary properties and hip designs  That is a standard  I found this particular hotel warm and inviting  The food and drink were delicious  The staff is well informed and attentive  The quotSpectacularquot guest rooms and bathroom are large and well appointed  The W Chicago is a creative reincarnation of a historic structure  I am already eager to stay at this hotel again  
P => Vastly overrated We    eight colleagues and myself    were in Chicago end of ember for a  day business stay and we all stayed at the W Hotel on West Adams St  Our ages range from  to  years old  There wasnt a one of us who was NOT annoyed and displeased with this hotel for many reasons  None of us had a positive thing to say about it except that it was possible to check out and leave  The overall interior design is as tacky and pretentious as can be imagined  When you walk into the lobby you think you are walking into a Las Vegas disco  There is a mirrored ball circling day and night  Various garishly colored LED lights everywhere  The color schemes used throughout the hotel are otherwise extremely dark and just plain ugly  In fact the entire design looks like a cheap imitation of Las Vegas    as if Las Vegas itself werent a cheap imitation There is disco music blasting in the lobby and elevators   Why do they impose this on guests who have a wider variety of tastes Why not just keep it quiet Enough of us have our own music in iPods etc we know what we want to hear and dont want the hotel to dictate their taste to us High Speed internet access in the rooms is a rip off  per  hours  There is no better deal for stays of multiple days  WiFi is free in the lobby but then you must listen to  their  choice of loud music  The rooms themselves are ridiculously small The closets are so shallow that it is impossible to hang up shirtsjackets in there and still close the door  There is no chest of drawers  There is about  inches space between the bed and most walls so if you want to get at your clothes you must do so from the suitcase  And to get into your suitcase you must put it on top of the bed    thats how cramped these little cells are  Never again  Next year it will be the boring Embassy Suites again with its spacious rooms and breakfast included  And a much better location to boot  
P => Cramped quarters at the W We booked a weekend through priceline com for  a night  a savings of over  from the advertised rate  Positives good location helpful staff clean and quiet rooms with good bath amenities  Negatives room size too small bed uncomfortable  too soft thermostat unusuable as it was reachable but unviewable because the entertainment center cabinet was wedged up against it  If you paid the advertised rate for this hotel I dont think too many people would feel very satsified with what they get   a night is about right  considering the location  
P => Highly Recommend the W Our stay at the W was great  We were in town for the Chicago athon so the location worked well for the walk to Grant Park  The room was spacious and comfortable  The bathroom was a nice size with Bliss products  The staff was exceptional in helping us with dinner reservations giving directions even suggesting and scheduling a massage after the race  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful  We would stay at the W again  
P => Dark and disappointing As a young cosmopolitan couple or so we like to think we always try and stay in minimalist boutique type hotels whenever we are on vacation in large cities  We like to try and avoid the impersonal chain hotels and were hoping that the W would provide just this whilst still having a great downtown location and excellent service I cannot express just how dark and depressing the W is  You cant argue that the place tries to be stylish but from the moment you enter the hotel it feels so claustrophobic and as if you are stepping into a dark nightclub in the middle of the day  I was craving daylight so badly that at times I couldnt face the idea of going back along the black corridors to my dimly lit room I think that if you pay for anything more than a standard level room it would be a little bigger but our room was very small compared to other excellent hotels we have tried in Chicago city centre  The bathroom was a sqeeze to say the least  A lot of reviewers have said that the staff are helpful  They are polite and attentive but no more so than other places we have stayed in the past  It is such a shame than this overpriced hotel did not live up to our expectations  In sumy it is pure style over substance  
P => Other reviews are accurate I always read the Trip Advisor reviews and then approach my stay with an open mind  As with so many other reviews the lobby and halls are indeed VERY dark  too dark to be chic and dark enough to make me uncomfortable  The rooms and bathrooms are VERY VERY small  the one double bed took up   of the room  The toiletries are nice  The front desk staff was always prompt helpful and courteous  The conceirge was very knowledgeable and went out of his way to make a dinner reservation for us that would work with our Opera schedule  Our room was on the th floor and faced the rear of the building and you could still hear the quotLquot  I give high ks to the staff but disliked the darkness of the place and felt it was overrpiced given the size of the rooms and the location  not much around there other than the Sears Tower  The Opera House is about a  block walk which was a plus for us as this was the reason we were in town  
P => Great staff ok rooms My husband and I spent three nights in tember at the W City Center Hotel for our anniversary  Although we are fans of the W Hotel chain in general we booked this room because we got a great night AAA rate  The location is fair  It is in the business area of the Loop and is VERY quiet on the weekends  The rooms are dark as described in previous reviews  I asked for a room facing the street facing the inner courtyard as I thought this would result in a light filled room  However the room was still dark because of the tall buildings surrounding the hotel  It was nicely orated and the bathroom was a good size with Bliss products  The best part was the bed which is very plush and cozy  The staff was also exceptionally friendly from check in concierge and housekeeping  Overall I would choose to stay in a hotel next time closer to the river or the Mag Mile  I felt a little isolated at the City Center but the price of night could not be beat  
P => Awesome     My wife and I have stayed at different quotWquot locations several times over the last couple of years  This past weekend was our  year anniversary and we ided to shoot up to Chicago and crank it up a bit  The W City Center did NOT disappoint one bit  The GM and his staff are first rate and made our stay one for the memory books  Could have not asked for better customer service and hospitality  Well be back  
P => There are better choices than the W  This is a hotel that is trying to be a nightclub  The BadIts a dark place done in shades of blacks and browns and dark plum  The lobby of my floor is so dark that I had trouble finding the elevators until I learned what to watch for  The room is approximately  x     dinky by any standard for the night price tag they put on it  It comes with no microwave no guest refrigerator and quotoptionalquot internet access at day  Furniture consists of the queen sized bed a small black nightstand a black desk with no drawers that looks like it came from Ikea and a huge TV stand stuffed with condiments the hotel wants you to buy  There is no room for anything else in this room If you get the side facing the El then you will hear that noise all day and all night  You will also hear noise from the lobby and from your neighbors quite clearly The restaurant is serves food that is fair to good but does not justify the sky high prices  There are better choices to be found around town both from price and quality perspectives The GoodCentral to downtown Chicago  Close access to the El and to buses and taxis  Courteous front desk clerks and an exceptionally personable bartender  To Net It OutI will not stay here again and have instructed my travel management company to that end  What this hotel offers is not what I expect for four star prices  I would rate it closer to two stars  I do not recommend it unless you like dark cramped places  
P => Edgy Walking into the W you immediatly notice that theyre going for a cool trendy edgy vibe  Its very different from most hotels  The lobby area or quotlving roomquot as they call it is  story dark with techno music and constant video displays on  walls  I actually liked it alot but some people at the conference I was attending did not  The staff is young and uniformly helpful and accommodating  I read some reviews on here before going which led me to believe that they would be snobby but I didnt find that to be the case at all  Its an old building from the s so that means it has some beautiful architectural features    our meeting room was fabulous But also leads to some variation in rooms  My first room was small dark and worst of all the air conditioning did not seem to be working so it was hot  After a couple of calls I got moved to a much nicer room that was larger lighter and cooler  Many of the people at my conference were saying that their rooms were small so watch out for that  The hallwasy are very dark Im not sure why  Part of the atmosphere I guess  Its light enough to see just different from what youre used to  Very comfortable beds bedding nice bath products Bliss  I thought it was kind of expensive probably wouldnt stay here again because of that and the location but I did like it  Its located in the financial district so mostly surrounded by office buildings  You have to walk several blocks to get to most shopping and restaurants  It is pretty close to the Art Institute  Id rather stay on north Michigan Ave  W has another location on Lakeshore Drive too  
P => Great W   Ideal for Business Trip I dont know where the former reviewers are getting their impressions  This W  not be a Four Seasons and note its an older property hence you very occasionally hear the plumbing from another room etc  but its a great stay If you want to avoid any pitfalls heres are two things to consider  Join Starwood Preferred  This really makes a difference with respect to upgrades and overall treatment in a W Westin or Sheraton   Email the general manager    the address is on confirmation    and make a request  Because of both I got a lovely large room that appeared to have been reated   and be soundproofed  I didnt hear a peep and the hotel was full On service this hotel was top notch  After checking in I got a call from the front desk asking if everything was satisfactory  Room service was always delivered when stipulated and everyone whom I encountered kept asking quotis there anything I can do providing a name to call on quot Pretty impressive So far as amenities the bed is great  I cant really tell the difference between Starwoods Westin Heavenly the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper    be a little firmer    and the W version  Also the Bliss products in the bathroom are very nice   better than the standard fare or even Aveda I would highly recommend this hotel  The W is not for everyone   some  not like the hip techno music that blares after    but its and outstanding if not a bit pricey stay  
P => Below Expectations My girlfriend and I checked in for a one night stay at this hotel Yes   the rooms are small and the hallways are dark The comforter was unclean   very visible stain present  Although I travel and know what most comforters are like this appeared to be over and above the typical comforter that is used over and over again  Not sure how a maid could not see such a stain while making the bed Next   if you do stay at this hotel or any other W   BEFORE you drink the water from the trendy bottle of in room water   check the seal  The seal on our bottle was cracked  Though the seal on our bottle was broken the bottle had been refilled and made to look like it was a fresh bottle of water  I guess some inconsiderate cheapskate who previously used the room didnt want to pay for the water he drank   and possibly wanted to make the next person sick  Nice try loser  We didnt drink it and I did bring it to the attention of the front desk  And although they did send two new bottles up   but we didnt get so much as an apology Next time your in the area take a pass on this W  
P => Dark vs  Light and the ironies thereof I stayed at the NYC W a few years ago and they are very trendy quot The first impression on entering the lobby is quotdark quot They use lot of candles for quotmood lightingquot I guess and its sort of hip but was hard to see coming in from outside  They had little cups of juice at the registration desk but I thought they were unlit candles at first  The corridors are also very dark  This Chicago W is an older refurbished hotel and the rooms are very small including the bathroom  I was only one but if Id had my spouse w me we would have been bumping into each other  The bathroom reminded me of being on a boat  Sink was very small and not enough room to put your toiletries on  Shower head was very weird   kept getting water up my nose  The bed was very comfy however though not a comfy as I remembered in the NYC W  Lots of pillows and a featherbed  The main problem I had with the room was I couldnt get it dark enough at night   ironic considering this hotel seems to love the dark otherwise  There was a window that had an opaque shade that you could see through and a roman shade over that but the roman shade only covered about half the window  I need complete dark to sleep and there was no black out shade so I had to sleep with a pillow over my head to block out the lights from the street  A complimentary sleep mask would have been nice or at least a way to pin towels over the window opening  The W is in a good location however so it does have that going for it  The doormen were very nice  Didnt eat there so have no opinion about the food  The towels and bedding were nice as were the toiletries  The or in my room was over masculine consisting of shadow boxes with items like silver cigarette lighter cigar case flask etc  I got a govt rate of  and I thought that was a little pricey  
P => Why is it this dark at two in the afternoon Stayed at the W for a long weekend in il   Got a great deal off of Orbitz  for airfare from Philly and  nights at the W  Location I found the location to be excellent  You are a block from the Sears Towers a block from Giordanos which is an excellent place to eat and theres a McDonalds on the corner  The L is  feet away and you are close to the big shall Fields store Check in Didnt get a good impression here  The bellhops held the doors we walked in and OH MY GOD everyone working there is a size  and wearing skimpy black dresses  Watch for the smell of flowers and perfume to smack you in the face  There are no signs for the front desk  We are getting gawks from the wait staff amp the bell boys   is it possible that there could be someone weighing more than  pounds in the building I couldnt hear the girl at the desk checking us in the music was so loud  Also the hallways were so dark  Why is it this dark at two in the afternoon Get some light in those hallways people There are shadow boxes of lighters spades lipstick containers    they are just trying to hard with this or  Room OK what the heck is with the big stuffed plum on the bed The room was itty bitty it was a Stuart Little room it was so small I felt like I was in a walk in freezer  Speaking of freezer   could the room be ANY colder Im fat and I am always hot but I was freezing the whole time in this room  Also theres no way we had a king size bed  It was a queen at best  The bathroom was a good size but not enough towels were given  And I agree with the writer who commented on the bottles of Bliss   its like trying to squeeze an elephant through a lemon  Tough bottles  Room Service Didnt order any HELLO   for caesar salad plus   tax   service fee and   delivery fee McDonalds was calling my name everydayBasically I knew this hotel was trendy  I knew there would be beautiful skinny flowery people there  But I felt out of place not because Im not skinny but because I didnt have a drug addiction or an eating disorder  If you stay at this hotel I think its a requirement  
P => W   Perfect Business Trip Finally a business trip that took me to a real city  How great was it that I snagged a room at the W Center City at the last minute It made my trip  I have read other reviews of this hotel some of which appeared to be from people who did not like the trendy aspect of it  I agree  Its trendy  However if you travel frequently and are looking for a hotel that keeps you comfortable in your room and wants you to mingle with others at night in a nice out of the ordinary hotel bar setting This is your hotel  I checked in around  PM on Monday il    The staff opened the doors for me both when I entered the hotel and left the next morning  The desk clerk was very nice and friendly although the computer was glitchy  I had no problems communicating with her over the music which I never found to be overly loud or invasive  After about  minutes I was on my way to my room  I stopped and a waitress offered me a drink  And like previous reviews mention the wait staff is generally young attractive female and dressed in very short black dresses  Unlike other reviewers however I found this to be a plus not a minus Upon getting to my room through the dimly lit hallway which I found to accentuate the mood the hotel is attempting to set I was given a King room with dark purple walls  The bed Best hotel bed I have ever slept in  If you are a bed snob and hate those hotels with the s bedspreads stay at a W  I wanted to delay my meeting on Tuesday morning just so I could sleep in the bed longer  The TV was big good channel choices and the furniture was nicer than most hotels I have seen  The bathroom was a good size and the toiletries were excellent  Also the showerhead  I have stayed at hotels where the nozzle was so low it hit me in the stomach  The  rainforest  set up was key I could actually get the nozzle over my head  The water pressure was fine  As was the water temperature  One other thing I found that the extras in the room were really well thought out  Proper water and highball glasses as well as wine glasses complete with corkscrew  After checking out the room I went down to the bar to have a beer  The candlelight and music made for a clubby atmosphere which is the exact opposite of every other hotel I stay at which is either full of rowdy locals snow birds looking for the early bird or depressed business travelers depending on what area of the United States I find myself in that week  It was a welcome change from the norm  The bar was crowded had a good choice of high end alcohol and beer and the staff was really friendly and engaging  I had a good time just talking to locals other guests and staff at the bar  The staff gave me some great tips on  after hours  clubs that were open on Monday night  That was the second time I wanted to bag my Tuesday morning meeting  Alas all good things had to end and I was off to my most comfortable bed  In sum I found that the hotel and room in particular were designed for business travelers on the younger side  It was the most refreshing hotel I have stayed in for business in quite sometime  If you dislike the  cookie cutter  hotels of riott and Hilton I strongly recommend this hotel to you  If you rate hotels by how good the free breakfast is       you probably want to stay elsewhere  
P => Wonderful Woom at W Just got back from W at city center  It was easy to find on Adams street even though the Dan Ryan is now all torn up for construction  Thank goodness for NAV in the car or we would have been lost from Yahoo maps I put too much faith in before we left  Pulled right up to the front as there were be  men one for bags one to take the car and the other to write down info  Was very pleasant and opened the doors and called us by our last name  Upon entering this hotel it resembles that of the pictures  A swanky Delano South Beach feel with very ornate almost contempary art o feel  One will need to dress to impress as this hugh lobby turns into a full service barloungenightclub at night Mostly see black on women and the men  Mostly swanky and artsy The menu for this area is small but wonderful  From cheese platters to european bread and spread  We opted for a bottle of champagne and first were given  chocolate draped strawberries  Thank you thank you  thank you  My girl freind was in heaven and what a perfect atmosphere to endulge  There are comfortable lounge couches and couches in corners that are very intimate  Lighting is low but the music was just fine  Service was outstanding  Prices are about  per tini and there is an extensive tini menu  Champagne is  to   You can also get bottle service for vodka etc Prices range from  to  a bottle  The back bar has King Louis at  a shot but I find this higher than anywhere I have been  Usally goes for   range  However the bottle at the bar was half full so go figure  The elevators are plenty and are very fast and easy to read numbers  The room access was easy  even with loaded hands  The rooms are a bit dated small but I found to be fine  There are dark painted walls different framed bottles cigar holders etc on the walls  The mini bar is well stocked and the bath is small but it ble but well appointed The room has an iron and board and a safe  The view we had was not the greatest but spent most of the day out and at night we were out late and slept in  Didnt eat too much there as we ate at a wonderful sushi rest  in town called Japanis or Japoniv one of the two  Sorry for the spelling however I dont recall the name well  That place was plain jamming It was packed full of young vibrant people all still eating late into the night  Made reservations with our concierge but the earliest we could get in was   It seemed perfect  I would recommend this hotel again and am looking forward to trying more quotWquot hotels again  One more funny thing I noticed was that the valet answered the phone not as valet but as wheels  I guess a play at the quotwquot theme seen throughout this hotel  Hope all enjoy  
P => We Liked it After reading all of the reviews of the W my husband and I felt like we were ready for an adventure  And we think we got it  When we pulled up and the bellmen were very helpful no problem  Front desk gave us a FREE upgrade   SWEET  I mean SUITE  We booked through priceline and paid less than   So we felt we really got a great deal  Loved the bed like everyone else coffe pot leaks but hey not on my floor I figure if they are sick of cleaning up the carpet where coffee stains are they will get new coffee makers  The location was fine for us went to HOTTIX at Tower records just a short walk away and got  price tickets for the only show that was left for that night which was Menapause the Muscical  It was very funny  Took a cab there as we were running late and then took the L back  No problems  State Street Fields is within walking distance as is Nordstroms rack  Two places I highly recommend for some great deals and of course FRAGO mints We ate at the quotWEquot restaurant and split an entree which was no problem  Still had our own vegetable rolls and I opted for a salad which was big enough to share  I had one after dinner drink and our bill was   Breakfast was only a short walk to McDonolds to save money  Who doesnt love and egg mcmuffin So with all of that being said depending on what you are looking to do in Chicago we really liked it  We would normally stay on Michigan Ave  but wanted something new and different and we got it  We would go back agian for sure  
P => All form   no function Its Pottery Barn once you get past the lobby Im a Starwood Preferred traveler who ususally books Westins but we thought what the heck and booked this W instead for a weekend in Chicago First   five bell staff standing around joking with each other each more glamorous than the next couldnt be bothered to get our bags but they did spend a lot of time high fiving attractive metrosexuals who walked by from the neighborhood Check In   very nice front desk staff but the clubby music was booming so loud that we couldnt hear her at all and she wasnt able to speak up   so we used hand gestures during most of our check in conversation Lobby   is truly spectacular o architecture with interesting gobos and light shows layered on top of it First room   was so small we called down to the front desk and told them we thought we were in an Edgar Allen Poe el  I literally had a panic attack of claustrophobia  What designer in their right mind would paint the walls of a  x  room brown and black and the  ceiling black We did NOT book through expedia or a discount broker we booked through the Starwood com site and I expect that when a room is bizarrely small the square footage should be listed so the customer can make an informed choice Front desk moved us right away and charming and cheerful bellman zipped upstairs to help us  We were moved into a much larger room   but still with the hideous dark paint and chic but incompetently designed lighting  Things that worked amazing bed and linens fantastic room service staff high end bath amenities  Wonderful shower heads  Free nice coffee in the lobby in the a m  with convenient to go cups Things that were just plain stupid no phone book or reference materials in the room   you have to call the help line for EVERYTHING  Extra toilet paper is in the hall closet   duh do you think thats a convenient place when you need it No hook in the chic bathroom so you have to put your robe down on a wet countertop   not so glamorous  NO VENTILATION IN THE BATHROOM   how romantic it is NOT to have bathroom smells wafting through the room  Most of the furniture was Pottery Barn esque painted the oppressive black  Very difficult to manage temperature in the room   the whole system is centralized and theres no individual control Overall Kimpton hotels are just as stylish but much more intelligently designed to actually function and not just look good  My advice   if you need to sleep this stylishly go to a Kimpton  If you love the groovy lobby of this W hotel stay someplace else and come here for a drink  
P => Hotel like a nightclub quotHipquot hotel  Fun  Clean  Down the street from art museum right at an El stop  Lobby looks and sounds like a night club even during the day with disco ball reflections scattered over two story inner courtyard  Ultra thin gorgeous waitresses serve drinks to guests on leather couches  Halls and room dark but sophisticated  Front desk quickly had extra lamps delivered when requested  Bathroom and room small but fine  Concierge very helpful with recommendations for tourist sights off the beaten path  Definitely not worth the  rack rate but a good buy for the night we paid through discount on line service for a very cold uary weekend  If you dont smoke dont get near the nightclub  
P => W on Valentines Day Business forced me onto the road on Valentines Day and I chose the W City Center because of the proximity to my meeting but with the fear that it might be busy due to the holiday I made a specific room request the day before and got a room on  away from elevators and vending machines  A nice touch One thing is that even on  I could hear the El rumbling by on Wells  I could only imagine what its like lower down  
P => Dispite what I had heard I loved it I read a lot about this hotel on Trip Advisor so I was concerned Id only ever stayed at the W in New York and found the rooms cramped and the staff too disinterested in service to be believed  I however really liked this hotel  The woman who checked me in was fanastic and friendly    I was a little concerned because it was very early in the afternoon say  or so so I was sure I wouldnt be able to get a room  I had also read that many of the rooms were quite small so I made a specific room request quotI have a friend who stayed here and loved room his room is it availablequotquotWhy yes it is And its clean Please enjoy your stay quotThe room was reasonably sized and the bed was extremely comfortable  It was also quiet little hall noise save a few slamming doors the inevitable nighttime sound track of all hotels Internet was expensive  as was the bar and the restaurant  However there is a Starbucks a block away so there is no reason to have breakfast in the hotel It did feel slow the day I checked in so be I narrowly avoided getting shafted in a poor room but overall I was very happy  The W has a cool look and feel and I felt cool staying here 
P => The good is very good the bad      I travel to Chi frequently and have stayed at the W several times  All in all I go back because the location is great for where I work and close to the L that goes to midway  The staff has always been great  They try very hard to meet all your needs  The hotel is very hip with a great lounge and cool bar and the beds are the best I have ever slept in Room size can be an issue very small rooms called cozies you dont want one of them also the lower floors are very noisy street noise  The rooms are clean but I have found lots of little annoying issues  Coffee pot that spill when you pour them batteries not working in remote shower with little presure and issues with heating system  The resturante is not great food is avg at best and very expensive  Double that for any room service  Salad soup and water in your room   
P => Hip   Cool   Trendy       PROS The service was incredible  Without a doubt everyone was very friendly and accommodating   so that certainly made my stay even more wonderful  As for the rooms I was fortunate and got a larger room unlike some of the other reviewers  So I was very happy and not to mention the bed was fabulously comfortable  That was probably the best part of the W I must say  CONS With the exception of the Sears tower    during the weekend we couldnt find much to do or places to eat walking distance wise  But the quotLquot is a close walk away which is helpful So if youre looking for something very modern and hip then this place would be great for you  Also I got lucky and got a great deal on their website    so try to find a special on the W site or elsewhere and youll be set  
P => Great Time at the W We stayed at the W City Center last weekend for two nights and three days and had a great time  We got a great price  on Hotwire and used the money we saved to shop and eat We spent time in Lincoln Park ate breakfast at Toast and shopped Bucktown dinner at Spring and Magnificent Mile dinner at Nacional  and tons of shopping  We got very good at riding the El from our downtown hotel and really didnt feel like we missed anything for not staying further north  The hotel was very fun and hip  we are in our thirties and felt totally at home  The room was small but we knew that going in and didnt spend much time in the room anyway  We had a great time in Chicago and wouldnt hesitate to stay at the W City Center again  
P => Darkness only covers the dings In order to fairly review this place you have to get past the contrived cool facade and really see it for what it is    a pretty bad hotel  Overall the hotel is very dark  the lobby the elevators the hallways  if you have bad eyes you are going to have a problem here  If you are good eyes youll just find it unpleasant  I think if someone turned up the lights full brightness youd be very surprised by what you saw  chipped paint scratches in walls less than clean surfaces  all masked by the darkness The basic rooms are very small  Upgraded rooms are definitely larger  I dont want to swear to it but I think that a queen room means you get a double bed here and a king room means a double  Many of the rooms face the el Chicagos elevated train so be prepared for constant noise This W is definitely not a luxury property  The towels are rough and scratchy bedding is better but not great  Bliss products are very nice but are never refreshed so youre left squuezing the last drops of shower gel out on your final shower The room was quite dirty  hair abounded and there was dust on the dark surfaces  I never felt quite settled in the room because it just felt icky  Also not that it can be helped I didnt find the location convenient at all  The Loop is dead on the weekends and it is quite a walk or a short cab to all the tourist attractions  River North is definitely a better option  
P => Very W My husband and I stayed  nights at this W  The lobby is hip and club like as I would expect from a W  The front desk people were very nice and assigned us a quotgreatquot room  It was a corner room but very very very small with only a double bed  We had reserved a king  The bell guy whose title is quotWelcome Ambassadorquot the W has its own complete lingo that takes days to learn   e g  housekeeping is the quotstyle departmentquot helped us find a new room this one having a queen bed  The beds were super comfy albeit small for two trim ried folks This was our first stay at a W and we thought the dichotomy of the hotel was funny  Sleek hotel rooms with trendy bathroom fixtures but the same old painted rusty door that was there when the joint was a Holiday Inn or whatever  Trendy leather lamps but yellowed outlet covers from the late s  Everything is dark the lobby the hallways and the rooms  Im thinking this is to hide the imperfections they couldnt quite update All in all it was a nice stay  The staff was really nice  The Welcome Ambassador gave us free drinks at the bar for our inconvenience of finding a bed big enough for two  Everyone constantly greeted us and asked if everything was swell  Our room faced the street on the th floor and the outside noise was minimal  The walls are thin though  I could hear the L rumble by but it wasnt terrible The health club quotSweatquot was very adequate  No weight machines but free bottled water TVs on the ellipticals I like to walk and it was an easy walk to the Art Institute State Street shopping and the theaters We lhed at the constant thumping music in the lobby and the elevators  That large round thing on your bed is a plum I was told  Theres no such thing as a view here so dont bother asking  I wouldnt think youd want to stay on the Quincy St  side though as the train runs right along the building Right on the corner is a Starbucks au bon pain McDonalds with many many beggars Corner Bakery  I always love in room coffee makers but it was just as easy to run to Starbucks We didnt eat or drink there  We did step into Whiskey Blue but the smoke drove us out  The lobby and bars were crowded after work  The whole district clears out on the weekends and I couldnt find a nearby Starbucks open on Sunday I thought the stay there was fine my husband wasnt as happy in the cramped room  
P => Mixed Feelings Stayed at the W City Centre over the athon weekend and had mixed feelings  The location was perfect for the athon as it was close to the start and finish and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when we went to quotwickedquot  Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district  On weekends its a ghost town around there not many things like restaurants cafes or shops are open  I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile that is where al the quothububquot is  As the the actual hotel the room was tiny not surprised  If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room  The washroom amenties were top notch and of course the Bed was Heavenly  The rooms were very chic but the walls are paper thin nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom The concierge staff at the hotel was below average  I always felt like they had no clue  Either that or they couldnt be bothered to make an effort The front desk staff were excellent  They were very helpful and friendly  If not for them I would have downgraded the hotel The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting  The food was brutal and the service was even worse  I dont ask for much but when I say Thank you please acknowledge me  When I ask for some water please acknowledge me  When I am ordering from the menu please look at me The lobby is one of the coolest places  The design and ambience is very funky  Its kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering tinis a few steps away  Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out as well Overall I dont think Id come back  Unless you need to be close to the financial district     stay at or near the Mag Mile and be pop in for a cocktail at Whiskey Blue one night  
P => Rooms are tiny   Great Beds  I was glad to be staying at the W City Center instead of the usual place in Chicago as I had heard good things about the hotel  Turns out there was good and bad as followsGOOD things included the beds very comfortable although small linens nice from the towels to the sheets and comforter the Bliss bath products dreamy and lovely   I usually dont take the products anymore because I travel so often but I took these the shower head great water pressureand the personnel who were almost all polite and cheerful BAD things included TINY TINY room barely could walk around in the room and the bathroom gave new meaning to the word small dark furnishings which made the room seem even smaller expecially the dark gray wavy drop ceiling   whats up with that the woman who yelled at me during the wake up call because she couldnt hear me the phone was broken and the ridiculous cost of cocktails in the lobby bar   for a small glass of house wine and a tini All in all for the price paid I prefer the old standby of the Allegro which is less expensive and closer to the office where I work  
P => Very hip        Very hip      if it were  be  Hotel concept is outdated   poorly lit with the staff all dressed in black wearing their little secret service headsets  Rooms the size of walk in closets and walls are paper thin  Looks more like a fraternity house than a hotel  Concierge was helpful and room service was acceptable but expensive  Overall would never ever stay at a W hotel again  
P => Chicago has many wonderful hotel options but the  W  is definitely not one My three dhters and I chose to rendezvous to Chicago from Boston Tucson and CO for our quotGirls Weekend quot Arriving at the quotWquot there was no welcome or help with the door or luggage their lobby is a quotcheapquot cocktail lounge the rooms are extremely small furnished very distastefully and even our requested upgraded room overlooking Lake Michigan was a joke  The only positive experience was their concierge s understanding and willingness to help us relocate to The Drake Hotel  With only a few short days to share together in the exciting city of Chicago we lost half a day and months of battle fighting for reimbursement  Finally receiving credit through a credit card dispute our quotWquot experience is behind us  Read and believe then book at The Drake or     Chicago has many wonderful hotel options but the quotWquot is definitely not one 
P => W Hotel W Adams St Chicago Illinois One of the smallest rooms I have stayed in especially in the Downtown Chicago area  I do believe that quotHotwirequot guests were given rooms that would be hard to charge the amount they charge for a nights stay to regular paying customers  I asked at the Desk for an upgrade if they had one available since we were checking in late and it was my Birthday and was given a very small room with a view of a two buildings  Had to keep the Roman Shades down for privacy we were so close to the buildings  The ambiance is dark and very purple and grey  The staff was friendly and helpful and the Beds were fantastic Very nice soaps  Very comfortable Beds with feather beds down comforters and pillows  The bed was the best thing going even though I do believe it was a double bed though they said it was Queen  Nevertheless the bed was just the most comfortable in a Hotel there is and if I were to go back there it would be ONLY because of the bed  If you want a small room with a wonderful bed and a view of window washers then go for it but I think this the price is way too much for what we got here even on Hotwire  
P => Very hip however    I just stayed in this hotel a few days ago for a four nights stay  I must admit that I love Starwood and the promotions they have  However this time due to a lack in time I booked last minute and got a rate of  per night but got the fourth night free  When arriving at the hotel I was very impressed by the lobby  The hotel is very dark which feels like a nightclub even during the morning  Its focused towards young and hip people as well as businessmen due to its location in the finance district  But it is very far from everything else including shopping on Magniicient Mile  We got two rooms for four adults and a child  The rooms were so tiny you couldnt fit anything and we requested for two double beds  It took us a long negotiation to rearrange accomodation and we got a quotsuperiorquot room instead which is much nicer and is also very trendy  I loved the room the bed is sooo confortable  However the W lacked some basic luxury service such as cleaning of dorrway  some people left food for a whole day wuthout it being cleaned  furthermore there was no pool which is annoying when you have kids  Everything you see in the room is beautiful but you have to pay a lot of money if you want to keep it or use it such as a large bottle of water next to the bed which costs  Overall though the hotel is very well designed and even though the staff wasnt very friendly I thought that the rooms and the general trendy atmosphere gave this hotel something to talk about  
P => Ok concept but the stafff  The staff basically the outdoor staff need to learn some manners  I have seen these people give guests and even people walking down the street it is on a busy street heavy with foot traffic rude hand gestures and lh If you want people to stay at your hotel and least treat them with respect or quit if you dont like or know how to do your job I would never stay here again  
P => Wonderful beds and rooms I had a great stay at the W City Center this y  There wasnt much of a view from the room but its right downtown so I knew what to expect  The room was quite large and comfortable all the way from the bed as usual for a W to the chaise lounge by the  inch TV  The bathroom seemed quite large to me and the toilet had its own little room  There was really good water pressure too  I was there over a weekend so the bar wasnt quite as crowded as it would be on a week night  As others have noted the lobby area is great and well appointed  Then again so are the rooms  Housekeeping does a good job of keeping everything neat and clean  I enjoyed the food from room service it arrived hot and fresh  All the staff I encountered were very friendly  I had some friends arrive a day later than me I spoke to the Welcome Desk and they did their best to have their room ready early as my friends flight got changed and they got to Chicago at am  They even gave them an upgrade Eventhough it was very hot Temps near  the AC didnt give out at all  Its walking distance to shopping and Grant Park  The inroom coffee was nice but theres a Starbucks  a block away along with a couple of convience stores  The next time I need to be downtown Chicago this is the place Ill pick  
P => Excells in some important areas average in others Some people dont take well to the W concept   a hotel that is quothipquot sleek and a lot like a nightclub  Apparently all of the Ws look different and have a unique flavor  When a family member couldnt use their non refundable reservation my fiancee and I found ourselves going in their place and I must say I was rather curious as to what the whole quotWquot experience would be like Now before I go on I have to note that I consider no hotel to be quotperfectquot   the best they can do is exceed my expectations and the W did that in certain regards First I was worried that due to some adjustments to the reservation we would run into trouble at the hotel front desk   that there would be some confusion over the changes  However everything went smoothly and we were off to our rooms within moments  The lobby staff   and there are a lot of them standing around in uniforms   were there guiding us to the elevators they call them quotliftsquot and trying to help  Everyone from the front door to the room was very welcoming respectful and helpful  Having been at a few very nice hotels in this city where the staff couldnt seem to care less that youre there   and not just to me but to customers in general around me   this was a big plus  When I went out in the morning I was always greeted and the door was held open for me  Now to the room itself which held some plusses and minuses  The room itself was small but not cramped for two people  This was probably the smallest room weve stayed at in the downtown area with the room we had at the Intercontinental being the second smallest  However we certainly werent to the point where we felt like we were climbing over each other when moving around the room at the W  Beyond that the dark yet warm colors of the room and the silly comforts a big stuffed grape just about the cutest teddy bear Ive ever seen   and this is a guy writing that that can be found in the room  The room also offers a DVD player for use free desk hi speed internet not free and   although not priced   a mini bar and accessories area hat snacks kits etcThe best part of the room was the bed which was similar to the Westin Heavenly Bed although I actually preferred the W bed   it seemed a little less mushy than the Westin bed that I experienced during a stay there earlier this year  The W bed stands out as my favorite hotel bed   by a fairly ent gin The size of the room in general was not a surprise really  The room cost half the  regular rate so I wasnt expecting a suite  The other element is that the hotel was previously the Midland Hotel an older establishment that dated back quite a ways  Given that its not a surprise that the rooms are on the small side The bathroom was nice but not stunning  There was a nice sized step up bathtub which I promptly nearly tripped into the first time I entered the bathroom vanity mirror bliss bath products and an adjustable shower which I had difficultly clamping into place so that I could stand directly under it  The bathroom was clean and a bit above average but I wasnt bowled over by it  If this hotel had the Westin bathroom and the W rest of the room it would be perfect Other little things   the room was a bit dusty in the visible areas but the unseen areas behind the desk etc were more noticably dusty  Id guess that the room hadnt been used in a little while but the hotel had just been jammed the day before  Other than that the room seemed crisp and clean  We needed a wine bottle brought some and forgot our opener but they had one right there in the room for use  A CD player   complete with W relaxation CD   is also available in addition to the DVDCD player under the TV  Need anything Tap the Whatever Whenever button on the phone  If you want DVDs or CDs for the room the hotel has a music and movie library As other reviews note the lobby does turn into something of a nightclub at night with music playing their quotfemme fatalequot waitresses serving drinks and people mingling around  Its quite a sight especially coming from the quieter room areas  The Whiskey Blue bar is located just off the main lobby area  There is also a restaurant  A pretty nice exercise area called quotSweatquot is located on the third floor  Theres no pool here but the W Lakeshore in Chicago does have one  Theres also rooms available for business functions We dont usually order room service given the ridiculous charges plus the already high prices but we ended up doing it here and although the prices were still rather high with the charges I was astonished how good the food was  I read tons of reviews where people are disappointed by hotel room service but the food here was A quality  I had an incredible chicken breast sandwhich while my fiancee had a steakburger  Both came with a side of tuscan potatoes  Both entrees were just terrific and room service was prompt  They also called after to check how everything was  Everything was great in that regard In terms of eats nearby there is an Osco CVS Pharmacy Walgreens and   nearby for snacks  Theres also a Sbarros Pizza within five blocks and a Gioranos Pizza not far and a Corner Bakery nearby  However being in the downtown business area theres not much for quick eats nearby on the weekend since a lot of things are closed  Theres a couple of McDonalds within a few blocks as well  However for a fancier meal its a bit of a walk  In other words if youre here on a weekend and dont feel like walking anywhere to get a bite be prepared to call up room service There is an quotLquot Quincy station right out front so those coming tofrom Midway airport will have an easy time getting the Orange Line here  The nearest Blue Line station from OHare isnt far either but not as close as the Quincy Orange Line station  Speaking of the quotLquot we had a room on the other side of the building and did not experience any noise  Those on the other side of the building  encounter some quotLquot noise  However we  were  facing the street and didnt encounter any street noise even on the th floor OverallPositives Service was excellent across the board   everyone from the maid staff to the front desk were friendly and helpful  Almost everyone who I passed closely by in this hotel greeted me and everyone in general here really seemed like they were out to make a good impression  Ive stayed in hotels in the city where I didnt feel like my business was appreciated but here I felt like it was and then some  The room despite being small was nicely stocked  There was even a magazine rack  Despite being a dude I was impressed by the Bliss bath products which smelled wonderful  Room service despite being expensive      charge was incredibly delicious  Transit options are nearby and the Art Institute is not a terribly far walk East on Adams  The Sears Tower is also a block away for those interested in going up to the skyk  I did use the concierge service during my stay being from Chicago but I did watch them at work with other guests and thought they seemed quite knowledgable and helpful  Whether early in the morning or at night there always seemed to be someone available at the concierge area  Theres staff in the lobby area    theres definitely a security presence at this hotel  If you like the products in the room theyre available in the store off the lobby  Four very fast elevators   to the point where I felt the contents of my stomach adjust when leaving one morning to hunt for snacks for the day  Last but not least best hotel bed Ive experienced yet and available in the catalog in the room and surprisingly not as expensive as Id have guessed for the mattress Negatives The bathroom was nice but it could use some sprucing up to get it more in line with the look and feel of the rest of the quotWquot   it seemed a little on the ordinary side aside from the quite nice bath products  Our room was a little dusty as well  The room service as mentioned was terrific but the charge was the highest Ive seen in a Chicago hotel  This hotel is also in the middle of the downtown business district and theres not a lot  right there  especially on SaturdaySunday  Some people  not go for the whole quotWquot vibe but   not exactly being anything remotely like someone who would be into that kind of vibe   I felt welcomed throughout the stay  Although I usually concentrate reviews on the elements of a hotel that can be adjusted I will note again that the room was small  Some of the higher level rooms are apparently bigger but given the history of the building its understandable that some of the rooms are going to be on the small side  Theres also no real quotviewsquot here   youre in the middle of the downtown area and surrounding buildings Additional notes People have noted that the walls are thin in the hotel and that theyve had problems with noise from neighboring rooms  We were at the end of a hallway so this was lessened but everything seemed quiet from the nearby rooms and when walking down the hall  There were also flowers at the end of the hall and ice machines are located on every floor   Overall I wouldnt stay here for regular rate although this is coming from someone who cant imagine ever paying over  for a hotel room but it is definitely something I will look out for again on Hotwire or Priceline although I think its only on Hotwire  
P => Loved this hotel The lobby was truly dazzling with the feel of an upscale night club more so than a hotel  I was fortunate enough to snag a quotSpectacularquot king room   more than enough space for one person   room was very clean and the or pretty much matches the photos on the website  Loved the extra touches like the cordless phone cd and dvd player huge fluffy towels and bathrobe complimented with Bliss Spa products The highlight for me was the bed   comfortable doesnt even begin to describe The staff were attentive and very friendly  The only negative was the quality of the food versus the cost of room service   service charge tacked on not including tip  I guess thats to be expected with any  star hotel  I would definitely stay here again but would avoid room service  
P => Very Nice Once I Complained My driver from the airport told me that the rooms on floors  and below are much smaller because that is where the original building was  My room on the eighth floor would have been ok except for the constant industrial noises coming from the street  Get a room higher up if you dont want to hear the city late at night  I moved to the th floor and it was much quieter Stay in a superior room if you can it is very roomy and very comfortable  Nicely orated too Beautiful and stylish lobby but the non stop throbbing music does not make for a relaxing atmosphere  Most areas in the hotel hallways and lobby are lighted by blue lights or candle light which makes everything very dark and made me feel like I was in hiding  You might feel that this makes you dangerous and mysterious so it could be a good thing Fantasitc location for seeing Chicago and there are some great restaurants within walking distance  The food at the hotel was very good too  The staff were all bending over backwards to help the guests so I would recommend this hotel  
P => Very Hip I was impressed with how quotcoolquot this hotel felt  There was usually a young hip looking crowd in the lobby  be because there is a bar on each side of the lobby The lighting in the public areas is low and sometimes pink   like in the hall and ladies room  The restaurant is excellent and the staff is pleasant  I probably wont stay there again because our room was the smallest Ive ever stayed in   it would have been fine for one person but too tight for two   I booked through hotwire for  and I cant help but wonder if Id gotten a better room if Id booked direct  
P => Pretentiously hip Mixed bag  Positives very close to brown purple and orange lines Quincy ently well appointed rooms really nice soap  Negatives smallest hotel room Ive ever been in suspected second class treatment of Hotwire guests I still paid taxnight lame room service options after  p m  form over function approach to bathroom promised an unrequested upgrade from a double bed to a queen at the front desk yet wound up in a double bed and I really dont think they could have squeezed a queen in that room and since there were two of us we could have used the extra room floor mirror was pushed out of its frame on the one side  We were given the smallest room in the hotel I looked on the floor plan on the lowest floor rooms were on th with an inside view meaning the roof and more rooms but ooooh look they made a quotWquot out of gravel on that roof how hip   when they obviously had other better rooms available as we were promised one at the front desk and we checked in after  p m  so they couldnt have been expecting that many more people to check in off the street  Ive never complained about a hotel room but this was the closest Ive come I wonder how many of the quotintimacy kitsquot  next to the Pringles  short stack and foam W flip flops  on the room service tray theyve sold While this hotel isnt a large cookie cutter urban hotel like your average Hilton Hyatt etc  I felt somewhat patronized by what Starwood would like me to believe is quotcool quot Stay here if you want to be force fed corporate Starwood hipness but Id save some cash stay at a hotel with genuine character and there are at least a few in Chicago and spend the  night youll be saving and enjoy the city  A reasonable buy on Hotwire but Id sleep on the bus before paying rack rate  
P => The bed was like sleeping on a cloud This is a very good hotel  The bed was like sleeping on a cloud It has a nice boutiquey feel and very friendly and efficient staff  I stayed by there by myself on a business trip as a change from staying in one of the bigger chains and it was really a pleasant change the service was just as good  
P => Funky Funky Funky Neat hotel in the heart of the financial district  Very close to all of the subway elevated lines so transportation is a breeze  Hotel is funky with candles lit all over the lobby and modern but comfortable furnishings  Service was first rate  Concierge staff are excellent They will handle any question or reservation problem immediately  Make sure you ask for the AAA rate I saved  per night   hour room service and great food in the restaurant  Youll like it  
P => Poor For such a hyped hotel my stay was really very disappointing  Stuck in an end room with a view of the neighbouring roof that was completely uninspiring  Staff seemed disinterested and the queue to check out was enormous The W Lakeshore is  times better than this one  
P => Nice W I stayed in the W   City Center ch    The hotel is overall very good  The staff was very friendly and helpful  Check in was a snap as was check out  The Lobby is a scene Being from New York I am used to this type of thing but you could tell some of the midwesterners were a little out of place  If you are not looking for a trendy hotel the W is not for you  But if you are in the under  crowd looking for a little swank   this is the place in Chicago  I will be back soon 
P => Funkiest Place Ive stayed in     Funkiest hotel Ive stayed in  Lots of attitude great lobby bar  Top of the hotel bar is overpriced though the people working there quotbeautifulquot  I swear the elevator is pumped with a scent and the funky music makes it feel like youre at a party   even at AM when youre on the elevator with a hangover Room service and the hotel restaurant are pricey  Lots of better options around Chicago try the Chicago Chop House Service at the door was inconsistent  Sometimes they opened the door for you sometimes they did not  We also had hundreds of dollars in odd billings on our statement that had to be removed be sure to double check your bill and dispute anything  Fortunately the extra charges were removed without hassle As well I lost the access card to my hotel room and they provided me with a new one without any problems   though I had to produce picture ID  If you have an Automobile Association Membership be sure to use it to get a discount  The rooms are NOT good if you are staying with a business partner or friend  I would only recommend them for couples or if you are staying there by yourself because of the way the bathrooms are designed  
P => W Hotels make for a great trip Arriving at the hotel with friendly attentive doormen began the stay at a great property  Taking a walk through the lobby was a candle lit cool club experience  The front desk people were efficient and accomidating  Having stayed in the W Court in NY this was an experience as cool  
P => Great for business travelers For those frequent business travelers who want to be acknowledged and receive fast checkin service and friendly but quotwell leave you bequot service this is a great hotel Always a crowd in the lobby bar having fun  
P => Nice but not as good as W Times Square NYC Okay I love the W hotels  This one lives up to the W brand name BUT the room I was in was SOOOOOOOO SMALL I am not joking when I say that the king size bed took up   of the room  The desk was so cramped that I had to move it so that the chair could be taken out and I could sit behind the desk  When I took out the ironing board i had no where to put it  but managed to use the hallway in front of the bathroom  The bathroom is also quite small but more managable  I stayed at the W times square and was more impressed with the room size and bathroom  Location This is a great business location bc the W City Center is around the corner from most of the hot spots in the business district  Next time I might stay near the more happening magnificent mile bc then youve got stuff to do after business meetings  Gym The gym sucks  If all you need are a few cardio machines then youll be fine  I need a little more of a professional setting with free weights  Good news is that theres a full service gym nearby that has an arrangement with the W  for a one day pass  Its called the Union Station Sports Complex  Lobby this is the most happening place in the area at night  The lobby was always busy when I walked through it  You definitely feel like youre at the hot spot in the city when walking to the elevators to your room  High speed in rooms is expensive  per day up to noon  Wireless access is available in the lobby area  The business center is good bc you can access a free printer to print documents  I still love the W hotels for the funky style the heavenly beds robes and the aveda products in the bathroom  BUT the small room really brought down the score on this property  Since its a W I cannot give the hotel a quotNeutralquot or  star rating  SO above average is all I can do  
P => Funky and fun I concur with many of the earlier comments hallway and lobby were dark staff was excellent rooms were smallish but good  My room faced the El and I thought that really added to the overall Chicago ambiance  be its just me but I found the train sounds very relaxing  I had a quotmegaquot room and it was very comfortable though not really that huge  Extremely comfortable chaise though and the bed also was great  The bathroom was very spacious and had lots of counter space  Storage space was minimal though closet small the only drawers were in the nightstands  However location was very convenient to shopping though not the Mag Mile and only three blocks from the theatre district  Breakfast in the restaurant was very good  The bar is good but the specialty drinks are quite expensive  The staff were all extremely helpful and kind All in all I really enjoyed it and would stay there again  
P => Stylish amd cool but not perfect Just returned from a short weekend at the W CIty Center     and had a very good stay  The W hotel experience begins when you walk into the beautiful columned lobby   spotlights on the ceiling illuminate the cool dark lobby and the housetechnoworldbeat music thumps in the background  The staff looks cool in black and are very professional and helpful The rooms are not big by any stretch of the imagination but are more than adequate in size  They are modern and cool with fabric draped lamps and mod fixtures everywhere  I loved the modern art on the walls Frames with stainless steel lighters and flasks in them The bed was extra plush and quite comfortable with dreamy long pillows Bathrroms were nice too with arate doors to the vanity and the showerbath area  There were plenty of big fluffy towels and Aveda bath products  The stainless steel sinks and shower fixtures very much fit it with the rest of the hotel My main gripe was the antiquated heating system  It never seemed adequate and was hard to operate and the fitness room was an icebox  Also there was a little bit of chipped paint here and there in the rooms Room service was excellent and the Whiskey Blue bar was a cool hangout spot The hotel is located around the corner from the Quincy quotElquot stop and a couple of blks from the Sears Tower but that part of the Loop is pretty dead on the weekends  The McDonalds and the Starbucks across Wells Street seems to be the only thing open but the River North and Mag Mile areas are not far away  
P => Good enough to stay there again but not great Stayed here  nights in ember  The lobby is a little too funky for my tastes but thats not a valid beef as the W is supposed to be positioned that way  The rooms are nice but take care not to have a room facing the railway line or youll have a  am wake up call  The same thing happened to my colleague   does the hotel put all guests into those rooms unless they request otherwise or complain The bathrooms are spacious and tasteful and the funkiness in the room is not off putting  Beds are wonderful  Hallways are dark all the time same in the W New York   dont understand why   is funky   dark Food in the restaurant is good  Note that breakfast is a la carte only so dont eat there if youre in a rush  
P => Great room location friendly service Stayed at the W first weekend in ember for sightseeing amp shopping  Staff was extremely courteous from the beginning to end of the visit  Room was great W beds are as advertised  Location convenient for the El Art Institute south end of Michigan Ave  The lobby is a little too quotliving room hipquot had to ask where front desk was and the hallways are dark  the reverse Las Vegas but neither is a real negative  Highly recommend the W 
P => Great Service Held a business function at the W and was incredibly impressed with its efficiency and service  Would definitely use their facilities again  
P => I Loved the W Chicago City Center I had a great experience at the W Chicago City Center while there on business last week  The rooms are have a contemporary elegant or with the most soothing colors and the bed was amazing The hotel staff went out of their way to service myself and my guests and my hat goes off to the two Managers that I worked with k Matthews and k Harbec  This hotel is definately a home away from home with an exciting twist   a loungy feel with candels and mood music is relaxing to the senses  On your next visit to Chicago check this place out 
P => Terrific business  I recently organized a small but high profile business meeting at the W Hotel City Center Chicago  The boardroom setup with plasma screens was impressive and professional  The hotel staff provided me and my meeting attendees with incredible service but the most surprising thing is that they have really good food  The hotels public spaces are a bit dark but dont let that hold you back    I highly recommend the W Hotel City Center for business and leisure 
P => W for Wow The W hotel was an amazing experience  The staff was very couterous and the rooms trendy  Thank you for a wonderful stay and I will definitely be back  
P => Sleek cosmopolitan and sophisticated Our stay at the W Chicago City Center could not have been more pleasant  The hotel is beautifully appointed and utterly sophisticated  The boutique atmosphere is such a welcome change from the usual hotel surroundings  Service was impeccable from the bellmen to the manager on duty who introduced himself to us and then remembered us when we walked through the lobby area later in the day  If you want more than just the same old same old and are ready for a unique urban experience visit this hotel  I look forward to returning ASAP  
P => Great service I attended a  day meeting at the W Hotel  It was my first time staying at a W and it was definitley a differentpositive experience  When I went to the check in desk it is very different from any other hotel Ive been too   candles on the desk   kind of a sexy atmosphere  I have to say that the doorman the check in concierge housekeeping catering were all very professional and helpful  I lost my cellphone in the taxi to the hotel and the concierge was able to retrieve it  Everyone was so nice and friendly  The food at the meetings was great too and just a different experience  My room was gorgeous I loved the ore  It had a whimsical sophisticated feel to it  The only thing I would recommend is more lighting in the halls I found it too dark as did my co workers  I would say this hotel is more appreciated by the   something hip crowd  It has a night clubish schwanky trendy feel to it  The lobby is loaded with candles some special effects lighting and music  Its quite the hot spot to hang and have drinks in the evening  The meeting space at the hotel was great and our meeting was a sucess The food was fabulous and the catering staff was right on top of things Some of the olderconservative people mentioned that the hotel was a bit dark and very funky but they just chalked it up not being quotinquot anymore and still thought the meeting went wellwhich was plenty light and had an overall good experience staying there  At our meeting I loved the pitchers of water at out tables some had lemon swirly slices lime slices orange slices strawberries in them with made them appealing to the eye and a touch of flavor  Just little things like that make it nicer  Anyway I would recommend the hotel for a meeting especially with a younger crowd and I would recommend it for a romantic getway It would be a great place to go with friends too and just live it up in the city There is so much to do in that area I wished I had time to extend my trip and play I would like to go back sometime soon 
P => Good conference support Held a workshop in one of the meeting rooms last week and I was extremely pleased with the audio visual support  The AV person showed up ahead of schedule and surprisingly you have a person devoted to your meeting for the full time period  that is usually not the case  In my case he stayed in the room for the majority of the day  a relief when you have a number of speakers  The sales person was also responsive and available and helped us with any requests The breakfast and lunch were nice as well  We selected french toast plated for breakfast and sea bass for lunch  requests for vegetarian meals were met The attendees either loved or hated the look of the hotel  A little too hip for some  The lobby is very dark and gets very crowded during weeknights after work  mostly a young Chicago crowd  
P => Great for Meetings A walk into the lobby   is like walking into a nightclub I planned a meeting there and all of my attendees loved the or   the ambience of the building  Service was outstanding as has been my experience with all of the W and Westin properties  Furthermore it is a nice experience to do something like this venue for a meeting than the other quotstandard hotelsquot  The staff was wonderful and of note   the concierage referred us to a fantastic restaurant then the W sent chocolate cover strawberries to our group at the restaurant  Anyone who would like a change   needs to experience a W 
P => The best part of the Windy City is the W City Center Weather for business or pleasure make the W City Center in Chicago one of your top choices  The rooms are stunning the service is impecable and the on site restuarant and bar are fabulous  I stayed for an entire week and didnt have any complaints    most times I didnt even want to leave the hotel  Its conveniently located to lots of shopping on the Magnificent Mile the Sears Tower and many other tourist hot spots The next time I visit Chicago Ill be sure to stay at the W City Center  
P => Chicago W  Better than expected This is the th W that I have stayed in and I must admit that they are somewhat of an acquired taste This hotel like the other Ws is dark and has a real quotcool and hipquot feel to it  At the age of  I am somewhat beyond being hip but I enjoy the feeling that I am cool for staying at the W I enjoyed this hotel and would return  The desk personnel were very nice and recognized my Starwood Platinum status  They also gave an upgrade to my friend that was traveling with me  The lobby is very nice and has the usual W living room feel but this time with more of a classical library appearance  The drinks are quite expensive The room was very nice and had a sitting area  There were  baths  There was no problem with cleanliness  My friends room was also very nice and had more than enough room for his belongings  The beds are very comfortable  The rooms were quiet We did not try the restauants  
P => Total Disappointment This is probably the worst experience that I have ever had at a hotel  I was at a conference that had  states represented  After talking to almost all of the attendees I found only one that was pleased with their room and then I found out that they were given a suite for whatever reason  The rooms were very small with less than a foot between the foot of the bed and the wall  Then there were these ridiculous shadow boxes on the walls with cigarette lighters in them  It was virtually impossible to pass around the end of the bed without hitting your shoulder on one of the shadow boxes  The view from my room was a gorgeous tar and gravel covered roof of another part of the hotel  The bathroom was very small and even the closet was so narrow that you could not hang your clothes up properly  To top off the diminutive room the food that was served to our conference was down right raunchy  First of all they served fish to this large group not taking into consideration that many people are allergic to fish  Then the fact that the fish and the side dishes were completely tasteless didnt help matters  The meal the nd day was even worse than the first  Therefore if I am ever scheduled to attend a conference at this hotel again I will do a search for a local Motel   At least I know that I will be comfortable and perhaps can find food on my own that is palatable  Other than this horrible hotel Chicago was fantastic  
P => Amazing The customer is always right at the W hotel  My experience at this hotel could not possibly warrant a single complaint  The rooms are stylish and make you feel as if you are in a calm and soothing bedroom instead of a hotel room  The colors produce a feeling of contentment and the bed which has a pillow top mattress covered by a featherbed with feather pillows and a feather comforter will give you the best nights sleep you have ever had  The level of comfort and style in this hotel is unbeleivable  The bathrooms were ble with a very modern and clean feel  The furniture was colorful and comfortable  Discrepancies that I had with my bill were corrected immediately with NO questions asked  When I ordered room service which was impeccable I received a call from guest services afterwards asking if the food was to my liking  I got the celebrate package when I stayed which included champagne and strawberries a full breakfast free valet parking and taxes included for  then I received the second night for  Well worth every penny  
P => Yuck Overpriced  Being out of towners on a business trip we accidentally chose a hotel quoton the wrong side of the tracks quot So we went in search of another and found the W with its very cool lobby  Well the lobby was the only good part about this hotel  After arriving in our room we couldnt believe how small it was  You could almost stand in the bathtub and still reach the sink to brush your teeth It looked like a very old run down building that had a lot of knick knacks and trendy furniture added to it to try to justify the high price  This was literally the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in and we have traveled considerably in the states and abroad  Besides the  bottle of water in the fridge you could find an quotintimacy kitquot complete with condoms and lubricating jelly and some waxed lips in your room  Gross Yes the quotLquot is outside your window and is pretty loud but it is the least of your worries  Dont leave your window shades up as there are perverts in the office buildings next door that like the watch the guests  This hotel isnt really next to anything except the quotLquot and the Sears Tower  Do yourself a favor and stay down by Lake Michigan  There were many nicer hotels in that area of town  There was constant thumping loud music coming from the d j  spinning records in the lobby and the hallways were so dark you could barely see your way around  They were also having some model shoot in the lobby as well which was weird  Their quotKing Sized Bedquot room was not a king  It was a double  They had a fleece throw on top of the bedspread that had little hairs all over it  I will never stay there again  I am glad I can say I experienced the W hotels though so I know never to make the same mistake  Stay in a Westin  They are much nicer and not as expensive or quottrendy quot The only reason one would stay here is to rent a room by the hour The W Chicago says Trashy not Classy 
P => Fantastic stay My boyfriend and I stayed at the W City Center for four days in    We had a fantastic stay The staff was friendly and helpful  The concierge gave us dinner suggestions and directions to an excellent moderately priced restaurant that we never would have found on our own  The bed truly is amazing  This hotel is very sultry and chic  It feels like one very large lounge  Cant wait to experience another W hotel 
P => Nice staff terribly trained  
P => Meeting Planners Beware  
P => what a letdown  
P => Loved it  
P => 
P => awful beds The bed at this hotel was the worst I have ever slept on in a hotel  It felt like a super cheap mattress and the pillows were bad too  There was an open air window between the bathroom and the bedroom with shutters which is ok if you dont want any privacy  The service was good but nothing is more important than comfort especially for the bed  We were exhausted from the lack of sleep and that makes the trip less enjoyable  We had to pay  PER DAY to park there  Would have stayed mid city had we known  Way to much money for the low quality  
P => Fabulous Hotel After reading all the reviews I was a little skeptical of my visit  I have to say they couldnt have been more wrong  The customer service was great and top notch  The room was Great  It was big enough for three people  We had a great city view  We stayed on the nd floor  The bathroom is made a little weird with a sliding wood door and wooden shudders but it still maintained privacy  I will definitely be staying here again  The only downside to the hotel is parking  There is no cheap parking ANYWHERE around the hotel  And the business center costs   per minute and   each additional minute  So needless to say if you dont have a laptop you will not be able to get online  
P => They had me then they lost me   literally  But still lots of good amenities and terrific location  My first business trip in a long while went to Chicago to spend two days working on a project and chose this from several in the area that my company offered because we had a great corporate rate and location was good  Initially was very impressed  We checked in mid day and both my colleague and I immediately were able to go to our rooms early  Trendy vibe the moment you walk through the door  Through some promotion I dont recall Im currently Starwood Gold so was upgraded to a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier on the th floor and given pm checkout on the day of departure which was nice with a late flight  Room had flat screen TV two double beds well equipped bathroom with nifty Bliss amenities and theres a Bliss spa on premises  There is an odd window in the bathroom with shutters that can open and close  I didnt mind it but can see where it might freak out traditionalists  iPod docking station on the nightstand has become an expected but welcome amenity in this class of hotel  Weird traditional analog bedside clock was very hard to see if you woke up in the middle of the night  Closet space is strange because clothing storage is in drawers undeneath the closet so you have to awkwardly bend down to get your clothes  Not a deal breaker but if I had a bad back would be annoyed  I missed some small amenities like an in room coffeemaker and a stand for my suitcase for packingunpacking  Everythings very design y and trendy and theme y  The extra roll of toilet paper in the bathroom had a cover titled quotBackup Planquot the newspaper was presented every day in a grey bag titled quotNewsquot that hung on the doorknobeven the bathmat had the word quotStepquot inscribed on it  Little details were fun guess these are a W signature but I dont stay at a lot of them Had best intentions of working out so I did visit the pool and gym area which seemed well equipped  The pool is indoors but there is an outdoor k which would be fun in the summer months  Loved the treadmills facing the lake  Sadly business and sleep took priority and I never made it there to actually work out  Had a great ahi tuna sandwich for lunch at the lobby bar and our group even briefly checked out Whiskey Sky the rooftop bar which wasnt as exciting as wed hoped   very small and the view was better from my room We had the chance to try their Acura quotWherever Wheneverquot service where their driver will take you anywhere you need to go within  miles of the hotel   much more pleasant and fun than a regular taxi cab  Service starts at noon so not great for early morning business meetings but a really fun perk  So I was feeling great about the place initially but the love affair ended abruptly when after a grueling  hour work day I came back to my room to find that theyd checked me out  All my things were still there untouched but a friend came to visit and texted me to tell me the front desk told her Id checked out  A half hour ordeal ensued with a manager Sasha who insisted my reservation was only for one night though I had an itinerary and materials given me at check in that clearly stated two nights and suggested that somehow I had made the mistake  quotNo theres nothing noted here in the change log it always was for just one night   quot she kept saying over and over again  Wish shed spent less energy insisting I was wrong and more energy trying to fix it  I was finally checked in again but the next day the bill slipped under my door was wrong on so many counts that I had to go to the front desk again to fix it  Wound up with two arate bills one for each night which should be fun for submitting expenses Parking was a breathtaking  so I was glad I didnt have a rental car internet access was  for  days and they charged me   access for calling the airlines  number  Be aware  Would I stay there again Sure  But Id make them print out proof of my check out date and rate the moment I checked in  I would skip the internet access and stick to the cell phone for all my calls even  numbers The hotel is a block away from West Egg Cafe a favorite breakfast spot and another restaurant recommendation is Graham Elliot not in the neighborhood but worth seeking out  Pumpernickel crusted sturgeon was amazing  
P => Dont Worry about the Bad Reviews I stayed here for my th birthday weekend and was a little nervious about some of the reviews       Dont worry this is a nice hotel with a great staff  We got a lakeview room which I was also worried about and it turned out to be great  If you can get past the cost which you already know about this is a great place to stay  Close to everythingfree Acura car ride GREAT BED 
P => For the money I didnt like it enough Cons  Had to walk through parkingdrop off area to get in    to  blocks from any restaurants etc   No prices with snack bar  Continually transferred when talking to customer services  Cooooold barPros  Good gym and a pool with a view  Friendly staff on the whole  Nice room comfy bed cool furnishings and well supplied  Beautiful viewStayed here on the first night of our honeymoon and were upgraded to a lake view room which was pretty spectacular  The room was a good size and well furnished with a really comfy bed although if youre not into contemporary design you might not be so keen During our stay we used the gym which was pretty well equipped  The pool was a little on the small side but there were rarely more than a couple of people in there so it wasnt a problem  A fruit bowl at the pool side was a nice addition too The staff were friendly and we didnt encounter any problems with service  When phoning down we did tend to get transferred around quite a lot though a problem I also encountered when phoning ahead of our trip The hotel is a good looking place and well designed but let down a bit by the fact that you have to negotiate a busy setting down area on the way in   an addition to a relaxed atmosphere this does not make The W hotels make a bit of noise about the munchie boxes they have in their rooms which are really just snack bars and definately not free so do not be fooled  Ours didnt have a price list and some of the packets had been opened not cool The hotel is fairly central and just across the road from Navy Pier  Its a good few blocks to anything much else though which is why I wasnt so impressed with its location Its got a good bar up on the twenty something th floor but be warned its coooold  From chatting to the girl behind the bar I got the impression it was always like that  Perhaps a busy friday night would warm it up This is a great hotel if your into nightlife with a bar in the lobby and another higher up a buzzing atmosphere and good facilities  The rooms were generally well kept and well designed  I would recommend it for someone with plenty of money looking for somewhere with a good buzz  For me though it was just a bit too expensive for what it was  
P => Claustrophobia Anyone I thought this was a new hotel and found out that it has been in business for over  years  The upstairs bar reminded me of a bad dream from the pre disco s with Black Lights  Daytime is alright with the Mackinac Island style rocking chairs overlooking the Lake  Everything screamed progressive   with young Turks ordering tell and Red Bull cocktails for  a pop  Most of the visitors that weekend were government employees   not a business friendly atmosphere  Rooms were small elevators were slow and very crowded   whoever designed the foot traffic pattern must have a sardine fetish   since this is how you feel at the elevator cue  Mediocre food   helpful staff though  Would only recommend if you are under   
P => loved it got lucky when i chose to quotname your pricequot on priceline  i chose the area of the city and bid   my bid was accepted  at first i was a bit hesitant because of some of the reviews that i had read not necessarily on this site  however i was pleasantly surprised  we stayed in a cityview room on the th floor  though not as amazing as a lake view it was still great  you can enjoy the lake view at the elevator alcove where they provide a telescope  i would have gladly paid the standard rate for our room  we had a king sized bed and the room was quite spacioius  although i could hear people in the adjoining rooms during the early evening it was silent when i went to sleep  the hotel is very trendy and hip  wireless is free in the living room also wonderful for people watching  the staff was very helpful and courteous  the rooms were spotless  would definitely stay here again  
P => Great location   very sophisticated hotel The kids thought the hotel was very cool  They loved swimming in the pool and looking out the window in our room at the lake and Navy Pier  
P => Overall Nice Stay The W Lakeshore is located along the water and seems like a great location for the warmer months  We were about a  minute walk to Michigan Avenue where all of the shopping is  Overall we had a very nice stay at the W  The lobby is very cool and club like  Our room was more simple than I would have thought  Since I had stayed at the W in Montreal I would have expected more color and fur The room was asian inspired and I did like the lounge chaise and the window with shutters that opened into the room  The staff was nice and helpful when asked but did not go above and beyond  We were happy with the value that we received considering we spent about  a night  It was clean and comfortable  
P => W stands for WOW What a great place Beautiful hotel comfy rooms lots of amenities  Workout facilities were top of the line with indoor pool overlooking Lake Michigan  
P => Loved the Bliss Spa but hotel could loose the  too cool for you attitude  The bed was comfortable but one of the lamps didnt work and the room service was beyond bad  The room appeared to have been reated poorly from a hotel that was clearly NOT  star as W rates itself  Too bad because its in a a nice location good view  But the crux of it all is the quottoo cool for youquot attitude  Its the antithesis of the other Starwood brands such as Westin and Sheraton  There are better options in Chicago  
P => A smoking room   and I sure dont mean the view I stay in lots of W Hotels  I have seen it all   and then some  The staff was nice some were exceptional k Bernardo and the Acura Experience folks saw way too much of us  I was actually a little excited about this hotel across the street from the beach beside my conference at Navy Pier walking distance to MI Ave and it has a pool   and here goes the story We check into the hotel  Our room  has a view of people working in their office city side the room was small the furniture was chipped the room was just blah  I just smiled I was staying for free on a free weekend redemption  I refuse to even comment on the often bemoaned SHUTTERS arating the bathroom and bedroom Well I will say this I dont know anyone   ANYONE I am that comfortable to share necessity time with like you do without turning on the shower for a noise buffer  It was just all the little things that didnt add up for me  It is as always for the younger traveler not the grandma that was complaining about the music on the elevator  The Whiskey bar upstairs was nice if not a little bland in or  The bartender was terrific  The next morning we called down to WheneverWhatever for a coffee maker to be sent up and it promptly arrived  The lady was kind enough to set it up and start it for us  I was glad to move to the Sheraton Towers after checking out of there not that the W was bad   it just didnt wow me like usual  I blame it on being Wd out for a bit   am taking a break from them Likes location Acura Experience pool staffDislikes City view smoking room amount of people that I dont think were guest floating around paying for internet and no I wont walking to the lobby to get it for free   bring it to me my overuse of the W brand at the moment and being tired from too much work travelOverall Its great for younger travelers you can walk most places youll want to go and you can easily cab it anywhere else  If you dont know who is on MTV you probably shouldnt stay at a W  You will just complain afterward  Otherwise Ill likely stay there in the future but I will upgrade to a suite  
P => Love the  W  Stayed here for a night during a business trip  Had a King Room    The bed was one of the best Ive slept in as far as hotels go  Loved the or and the overall set up  Especially loved the Bliss Ammenities Bathroom had only shower no tub in case thats an issue Hotel is walking distance  Blocks to the Magnificent Mile but there are closer hotels if thats a priority  One nice touch here at the W is the quotAcura Experiencequot which is a complimentary Acura Shuttle service in a  mile Radius  Starts at noon   I booked lift to the Shopping District and the driver was informative and helpful as to where to find what I was looking for Lobby has a cool vibe and the bar was very busy Thursday night I would definitley stay here again 
P => W CHICAGO Lake Shore Drive W on Lake Shore Drive is a hip hotel right on Lake Michigan  We arrived off a train from NYC and got in early but were able to check into a great room facing the lake  The beds are the most comfy I ve ever stayed in  Yes the bathroom configuration is a bit weird with shutters that open onto the bedroom so that you cannot mask the noise within  Don t know why they did this except to give you a view of the lake from inside the bathroom  We booked the architectural boat tour through the concierge and that was fabulous  Every W hotel includes free Acura drop off service that you must book in advance  We got a ride to the boat tours as well as to the John Hancock building that evening  We visited the Signature lounge for drink and the views before dinner  It was a wonderful place to see the city from high up  Dinner at Bistro  was disappointing and I don t recommend it although the concierge did  W Hotels have a whateverwhenever button on the phone where you can request just about anything  The only time it disappointed was when we asked for help with our bags at check out the bell hop never showed up even though we called twice  All in all a very pleasant stay great location and the view sublime  
P => Great views over Navy Pier and Lake Michigan Hotel is right on the lake by Navy Pier which has some tourist restaurants boat trips and is a stop for the double ker bus sightseeing tours  Its about a  minute walk from the Magnificent Mile shopping area so if you just want to shop you might be better staying closer  Apart from Navy Pier there isnt much in the way of shops or restaurants nearby but you cant beat the views of the lake and cabs to Michigan Ave shops or Rush Street bars and restaurants are easily available  The bar at the top of the hotel is cool although its on a corner rather than at the front so it looks out over Chicago rather than the lake  Lots of reviews complained about the lifts and while its true we did sometimes have to wait  or  minutes for a lift it wasnt really an issue  Breakfast is served in the lobby restaurant or outside at the front of the hotel  Unfortunately this is not far from Lakeshore Drive which is quite a busy dual carriageway but its still a nice spot for breakfast  Staff were all friendly and when room service breakfast was late one morning we didnt have to pay  
P => Good water views and pool area I have stayed at this W Hotel and the W Chicago City Center  Both stays were for business  Id recommend the City Center location for business travel as I thought it had a quieter cooler atmosphere and also better rooms  Both locations offer free internet in the lobby but you have to pay for internet access in your room The Lake Shore location rooms were more plain and I thought the lobby was incredibly crowded and noisy  The rooms do have great views of the water if you request a water view room  Additionally I stopped by the fitness center and its really nice and modern  There is a great indoor pool and sunk area  The location seems like a perfect spot if youre vacationing and also want some time to relax within the hotel  
P => All Glitz No Substance On the negative side the lobby was simply packed with people all throughout the day due to the packed bar location  ft away from the reception  Elevators frequently backed up causing a line  The walls were very thin  Its a tall building though so there are some very nice views from your room windows  Overall the room or was fine and clean  The location itself is convenient to the beach amp Navy Pier but not to downtown  Youll have to cab it but at least there were always cabs waiting outside  Overall Id say that if youre simply visiting Chicago and want to see the sights you could probably find a hotel with a much better location and more enjoyable atmosphere  
P => Great location Nice Hotel The Hotel is a Hip place if thats what youre looking for I liked the location directly across from the Navy Pier and right in the heart of Streeterville not far from the downtown Loop area  I was a little freakout at first of the Shutters on the Bathroom but it wasnt a problem  Staff was very Helpful  
P => True W Experience THe W is a unique brand of hotel and I hear some people knocking the way they do things  This should be a fun experience a chance to feel hip and a place to escape from the normal hotel structure  I love this place and prefer to stay at a W when ther is one around there is not that many unless in a big city  I rarely travel for leisure so this is a great place to let loose  Plus you cant beat the location  I have not been to the other W in Chicago but the reviews sound simlar   I encourage people to navigate the website and leave preconceptions at the door  Some of us really need this kind of place in our life and I applaud the fact that they are doing somwthing different  Definately a step in the right direction for the hotel industry  
P => Three Star at Best I recently stayed  nights in this hotel  It was dissapointing  We arrived at around pm after a long flight and we were exhausted  It was not welcoming to enter the lobby with very loud rock music like a trashy nightclub  One does not expect this from quot Starquot Starwood Hotels  We waited for at least  minutes to get an elevator and the lobby area gets really crammed around the lifts  Our room was on the th floor with a nice view of the lake and Navy Pier  The rooms are on the smaller side and it is immediatley obvious that a really cheap makeover is masking old bones  The biggest dissapointment is the air conditioning units  The hotel is not fitted with universal air conditioining and hallways etc are not air conditioned  The room ac unit was very noisy and I was woken at least  times during the night by the squeaky noises from the fan unit  The beds are rather strange and sit on a wooden box  They are not the similar beds you get at the Westin and fine linen is scarce  The showers are ok although the water leaks onto the main bathrrom floor and is peeling the wallpaper from the walls  I lhed when I noticed only  bathrobe even after booking for  persons  I had already read about this on a previous review  We had to call down for a coffee machine which is another normal inclusion in any ent  star hotel  The hotel has a DVD renting program which I thought was a good idea  The location is good and only short walk to Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile  There is Starbucks  Eleven and McDonalds all within one block which is handy  Wine and Cocktails at the hotel are expensive min  each considering the ambiance of loud rock music every night  We walked to other hotels and found much better value and nice lounge type music often live piano etc but you wont get that at the W  The hotel is popular with young families and if you feel like using the pool forget it as it is always busy with little ones having fun  In sumy the hotel was a dissapointment and no where near the  star grading from Starwood that I expect  If you dont mind disrupted sleep from ac units loud trashy rock music in public areas then I guess the hotel  suit your needs  Like many of the reviews here there is a lot better value for money elsewhere in the city  
P => Awesome hotel great location We actually hotwired this hotel and were quite pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel we received for the price we paid   as well   we got a complementary upgrade to lake view  I highly recommend hotwire if you dont mind taking a bit of a chance on location   although there are tips to find out the location before you commit  
P => A very pleasant surprise After reading lots of negative reviews about this hotel one would think to go someplace else  Boy were they wrong We booked for a  night stay and everything went very well  The staff were very accomodative from the beginning to end and with a smile  Our room was a tad small w  kids in tow BUT the room looked nice and very clean  Did I forget to mention the FREE coffee bottled water and internet service at the hotel lobby I did not see that dreaded  coffee from previous reviews  Hotel management must read these reviews and make adjustments  We prepaid at an awesome price and the hotel is close to eveything a tourists craves beach Navy Pier Michigan Avenue Water Tower  After putting the kids down for the evening we ided to check out the night scene at the  hotel bars  Definitely not for quotried w childrenquot types BUT great for the quotcheckout that hottiequot single crowd and a cool spot for people watching  This is what my wife and I did for the most part while sipping our drinks  In conclusion I guess Forrest Gump was right after all  quotLife is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre gonna getquot  Take a chance and see you next time at the W  
P => Not Bad could be better This is definitely a hip hotel  The lobby is cool and inviting and while we were there Jamie Fox and some other entertainers were staying there  The fitness center is excellent and my wife and dhter utilized the Bliss spa and loved it  We were offered a pm late checkout  The rooms are very average at best  They are small and need to be updated  Our comforter and sheets had stains  The internet charge is   The concierge was not very helpful nor friendly  But the worst thing about our stay was the traffic noise  We stayed on the th floor in a lake view room overlooking Lake Shore Drive  The traffic noise was terrible until all hours of the night  Would stay there again but would have to be on a higher floor  
P => Sunrise over Lake Michigan I selected Hotel W Lakeshore in Chicago as a place to relax before returning on an  hour flight to Europe after touring some states in the US  I expected a chill down at the shores of Lake Michigan would be perfect  And it was    The location of Hotel W Lakeshore is perfect it sits right at Lakeshore Drive North and as I booked a double double with lakeview we had the best view ever  Also from there it is not far to the Magnificent Mile Michigan Avenue on which you find every kind of shop you can imagine The hotel itself has a loungy feel to it and can be qualified as a boutique hotel but one withlots of rooms  Breakfast was good but expensive  The rooms are nicely orated and well kept  Room service is good too On a trip to Chicago I would stay there again  
P => Perfect location hip hotel I have stayed in the W in Los Angeles before and I think the Lakeshore Chicago is much brighter and seems much busier  I think the location has to be the best part right across from the lake and Navy Pier  Access is easy via an underground tunnel just a few yards along the street there is a road between the hotel and the lake The lobby bar and restaurant all overlook the lake with floor to ceiling glass doors allowing the light to flood in and the gorgeous views to be accessed from any point  There are seats where you can just sit and watch the world go by out the front as well as restaurant seating I had breakfast in the restaurant a smoked salmon quotpizettequot  It was excellent and the coffee was great too  As a platinum SPG member I was upgraged to a suite  It was extremely quotcoolquot and comfortable  Had a great living room nd bathroom etc  The bedroom and ensuite bathroom were fantastic  photos attached  I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago  Oops almost forgot the BLISS spa There is a Bliss spa located in the hotel  Wonderful treatments available  I love that you can have a massage or facial and go back to your room in your robe without having to get dressed or be seen by the general public 
P => A big disappointment W is my partners favorite hotel so for his birthday I thought I could not go wrong by choosing this hotel  What a disappointment  The hotel was busy full of kids and teens with very loud music  The walls of the rooms are paper thick and could not sleep for the first two nights from the noise  The lifts were dirty and full of finger ks the tea pot was smudged with butter and the room was so dusty that after the first day we had to leave a note asking if the room could be cleaned  They had a DVD library service which we thought was quite good but took them over an hour to bring the DVD up  This W seem to be just selling the view which is beautiful and the brand  nothing else  
P => Nice location cool lobby area worn out interiors and room only ok Location  Off the lake   close enough to Michigan etcLobby  Nicely done club like ambience a little small thoughOther interiors  Very bad corridoors smell of staleness and moistness and look worn outRoom  Ok  Nothing specialService  Couple of interactions with the hotel staff werent helpful e g  asking about nearby area etcFood NA Didnt try 
P => All Fluff No Substance They  think a sliding door and shutters for the bathroom look nice but they dont muffle the sound of the shower sink or toilet so that the person in the room is always disturbed Further dysfunction is achieved by the motion activated air conditioning  It only works if someone is moving in the room  We dont move much when we sleep so the ac would shut off making the room excessively warm  Green is good but not at the cost of a good nights sleep  
P => Not the best in the W chain but adequate  This property needs a little updating  Iin my room the pull cords on the shades were broken and the shades were frayed  The or was quotokquot and room was small However the view was good and I liked the fact that the hotel had an Acura to take us around  I would probably stay here again but it is not high on my list  
P => Fancy I like the dark oration in the room kinda modern amp trendy style I also like the breakfast in hotel  
P => The  W  Really Should Be  Club W  Pick Another Hotel If you are looking for a nice girls trip in Chicago during the winter by all means skip this hotel  Our flight had us arrive about pm at the hotel on the Friday  We entered the hotel and the lobby was covered in people smoking and drinking and for a second we were so taken aback we couldnt find the check in area  The people were sooo rude we couldnt understand it  WE got to our incrrrrrrrrrrrredibly small room with a nice view of the lake I might add but there was no where to put toiletries  The rooms have these awkward plantation shitters that close off the bathroom from the bedroom and unless u r with your husband that is a bit awkward from a privacy perspective  The quotWhiskey Sky Barquot is on the top level of the hotel which is pretty forgettable is this really what people consider fun and guests of the hotel have to share the elevator with all of the patrons coming to the hotel to quotget their drink onquot  Yuck my girlfriend unfortunately was the recipient of someones cocktail when he misstepped and lost his balance in the elevator  The spa was forgettable expect for the showers in the spa  AWESOME but they serve you no brownies like they said in the add and there is NO COFFEE in that dang blab place  AWEFULLLLLLLLLLL I complained and wrote a detailed letter do you know what I got back an invitation to try them again  on my dime  ARE YOU KIDDING      apologize give me a partial refund or even invite me back for a reduced rate but just ask to come back again  DO NOT GO THERE EVER Unless you really need a drink and cant afford one  Then step on the elevator I am sure you will taste someones alcohol 
P => Never again  Easily described as  urban cheap   Thankfully we did not spend much time at the hotel  The room was small   we got shafted with two full beds rather than a queen two queens or a king  The bathroom is part of the room with a wooden sliding door  The cable went in and out  Our card keys had to be replaced several times   your card is required to use one of the few elevators and for entry into the fitness area  The fitness center consists of some treadmills ellipticals bikes a set of dumbbells and several machines  There is only one free standing bench and the ceiling is too short to do any standing exercises  There are no vending machines only bottle Fuji waters in the room among other snacks and over priced room service  The hotels web site talks about quotthe moment when the sun sparkles through your window you awaken to the skyquot   even the cheap window shade would not go up  Chicago is an amazing city   staying at the W Lakeshore was the only negative aspect of our trip  If you care to try another W stay at the W Chicago   City Center an incredibly different hotel experience than at the touristy poor attempt at a modern hotel Lakeshore location  
P => Great Hotel with a View I stayed at this hotel for a few days for a girls spa getaway  We had a beautiful room with a gorgeous view  The spa was wonderful  Bliss spa let us use the saunasteam room the day before our appointment because we didnt have time to use the facilities the day of our appointment  The hotel also offers free dvds rentals  Room service was a bit slow at times though  The concierge was very helpful with directions and dining suggestions but we werent always able to reach them on the phone  We also took advantage of  free rides with their Acura promotion  The main downside was that the hotel was a little bit of a walk from the magnificent mile  Overall we had a great relaxing time  
P => Hip hotel but pricey  Had my wedding here last summer and was overall very pleased  I agree with the previous poster concerning room blocks  our group was spread out over a few floors  The guest rooms are clean and modern  The hallways arent nearly as dark as the W citycenter The suites are great  Large living room great walk in shower and sweeping views of Lake Michigan  
P => Great Vibe   Great Hotel Vibe of hotel is great  Love the chairs outside looking over the lake  Bars upstairs and downstairs are both very W    which is cool and trendy  Rooms are clean and updated  Highly recommend the hotel  My fave in the city at this point  
P => Best W in the Midwest W Lakeshore is a great place to stay in Chicago especially during summer across from the beach As a Gold SPG member I always got a suite and late check out  Though the rooms could use some remodeling the staff and views are fantastic  From the GM to the room service the staff is great  Bliss is great  
P => Great hotel great location  The hotel has a cool lobby and bar upstairs  The rooms are really nice and the location is great  You are in walking distance of many restaurants shopping etc  
P => Old Holiday Inn turned into a W and it shows Stayed here for the weekend to celebrate anniversary without traveling far  We always stay at Starwood properties and we got a great winter rate here so we thought why not  The lobby is well designed large and comfortable  Unfortunately the rest of the hotel isnt  The hallways are dark and confining and the rooms leave much to be desired  While I realize this used to be a budget hotel that the remodeled it felt like it  The ceilings still had that popcorn stuff on it and the carpet felt worn and dirty  The bathrooms are small but nice and of course you have the great Bliss amenities  If you have a room on the lakeside of the tower you do have a nice view that many hotels in Chicago cannot offer  The one really great plus was the front desk  They found out it was our anniversary and when we returned from dinner they had a bottle of champagne and strawberries in our room  Nice champagne too  on the room service menu  That was impressive  If you are going to Chicago and want to stay in a Starwood hotel or W the Westin River North and W Chicago City Center are better choices  
P => Once is enough thank you  I tried this place because Im in Chicago on business all the time and wanted something different  The hotel has a very contemporary feel and is a little trendy  I found the staff generally helpful  The rooms were spacious and well kept but I was put off by the   bottle of water by my bedside and the relatively high prices for room service  I chose to eat out mostly  The business center was nice once I finally found it and the hotel seemed to be a pretty popular choice  The security after dark was a little annoying asking everyone for their room keys before even letting you into the lobby and this was at  pm  You need room keys just to go anywhere on the elevators anyway so I thought this was a little excessive and made me wonder about their clientele  It was a clean hotel and a ent choice but there are definitely better hotels downtown for the value  
P => W Hotel   Staff is great I was in Chicago for business and spent an entire week at the hotel   I must say that my stay was great  Once the long day at the office was done   I walked everywhere  The staff was very helpful  the wakeup calls were on time and my car was delivered to me at the door within minutes Paying for parking and the internet is a given in downtown   but the view of the lake and the comfortable bed was wonderfulMy Brit and Scots business partners love the W        next time I plan to stay longer and use the spa  
P => Never failed to impress    Recently stayed at the W Lakeshore for a conference and really enjoyed my stay  The rooms are always clean and the staff is very courteous  I think my favorite thing about this property is that it caters to younger fairly affluent professionals  The lobby and lounge are nice to relax in without the headaches of quottouristsquot and convention road warriors  Nice job W 
P => W Hotel not worth the price This trendy hotel is very nice to look at and the rooms are cool but the staff does not care about customer satisfaction  The suits are not worth the price but the spa is outstanding  NEVER host a party there the cost is very high and the service is horrible  
P => W Lakeshore is my favorite hotel in Chicago I go to Chicago a few times a year for a fun weekend  If the W Chicago is available it is my favorite place to stay Pros Exceptional staff knowledgeable concierge and the quotwhatever wheneverquot program is great  Great location walking distance to Lake Michigan and the shopping on Michigan avenue  Short cab ride to everything else  Well equipped fitness room with erate cardio and weight machine areas  Bliss spa is great  Happening bar on top of the W and a nice casual bar in the lobby  Comfy beds and high end touches you would expect from a W Cons The rooms and beds are small  
P => Great Price Great Location ent Room Employees Could Care Less This is a hotel geared to the younger crowd  Im  and there were just a few guests older than me I paid  pernight through Hotels com and I got a quotSpectacular Room with a lake view  The or is nice it has a nice plasma TV the view was nice  The room was clean  The best part of the hotel is its location which is only an   minute walk to all the attractions on Michagan Blvd or the Navy Pier  They also have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere within  miles  I found that that saved a lot of cab fare  The negatives are that you can hear people when they are walkingtalking down the hallways Although this usually only happened during hours when you would expect people to be awake  I was at the hotel for  nights and it only happened a few tiems  I was never awakened in the middle of the night  I could hear the TV and people talking in the rooms next to me a few times during the day but it didnt happen at night so it wasnt disturbing The curtain shades dont do a great job of keeping out the light and I found that it a little annoying in the morning when the sun came in through the sides of the quotBlock outquot blinds  I had this problem even when I pulled the other blinds down as well  The open shutters from the bathroom to the bedroom are fine if you are alone as I am on this trip however would be a little uncomfortable if you are staying with someone as there is little privacy afforded when the shutters are closed The staff treat you more as a number than as a guest  They are very distant All in all you get what you pay for  I got a very reasonable rate and feel that I got a good value for what I paid  If you are looking for a high end hotel this is not the place for you  If you are looking for ent or great location and clean room then you should be happy here  
P => Very Nice Hotel Its been a while since I stayed but wanted to write a review  When we first checked in it looked so trendy  The music they played in the lobby Living room was always upbeat tranquil  We had a room with the city view which was nice  The hotel did anything you would asked of them with no hesitation  The hotel was not far from the fair grounds which is probably a  to  minute walk  Other places I would suggest a cab or drive  I am from NY and attend the Cubs game that was also amazing  We hung out in the living room for drinks and relaxed  The concierge was also a great help with destination or places to eat for local Chi town treats  In the future I would go back to this hotel  If you are not into the new hip trendy hotel with a club like atmosphere I would not recommend  
P => Never Ever Again  Ever  We never made it to the lobby  The stickily but sleepily friendly employees answering the phone with a straight face while spouting the enforced corporate tag quotHow  I make your dreams come truequot are simply that   corporate sheep being coralled as ordered After doing quite a bit of research my boyfriend and I found a reasonable rate online which we checked literally nine times but couldnt get the online system to book four consecutive nights in the same room  So we called the toll free number The very nice guy on the reservation line took care of us quoted the same quote we had found online made it so we didnt have to change rooms   it was great  He quoted our  dates back to us we confirmed all was well An hour later I get my confirmation e mail but instead of the reservation being for  it was for THE FOLLOWING DAY in the month of CH  I immediately called back on the reservation line and was reminded this was a non refundable reservation  I insisted we did NOT book a reservation for  so they said I had to call the hotel in Chicago  Upon my first two attempts I was transferred BACK to the toll free reservation line from the W Lakeshores direct number  I finally learned I had to use a key phrase and ask for a certain executive title which currently escapes me to not get transferred back to someone at a toll free number but instead someone within the hotel  Am I annoyed yetFinally I get another pleasant but useless person who says its non refundable  I say were fine with that we simply want the dates we requested in   She says she doesnt know how to do that  So she can change one of the days of the reservation in the system but not the other three  SeriouslyShe needs to call me back  In the meantime my boyfriend and I are panicking trying to figure out how to block a charged for a reservation on a date we didnt request  Eight hours later and more than a bit of anxiety and sweat the last W Lakeshore employee I spoke with calls me to tell me they made a mistake and the room is DOUBLE   YES DOUBLE   what they quoted us but due to their mistake and the vast price difference they will do me the quotcourtesyquot  of refunding the money  Gee thanks In the meantime theres a restaurant convention in town that weekend which is why theyre jacking up their rates apparently and the two other rooms at other hotels we were going to book   but let go of because we had a confirmed reservation confirmation number and all from the W   are now sold out  So is everything else I write an e mail to management at the W and am told they feel badly for screwing up our reservation so as a courtesy theyll offer to let us pay  more a night for the room instead of double  As a courtesy Am I crazy Did they just screw us sideways and then offer to let us pay more   AGAIN   as a quotcourtesyquotI point this out in subsequent correspondence and am basically told I can take this version of customer service or leave it and furthermore they dont believe their agent did make a mistake my boyfriend and I were both on the call we made no mistake or   and they literally said this   that this particular agent EVER makes a mistake Is the customer always wrong at the W Is a quote honored only if the reservation agent doesnt royally screw it up And if the agent does does the customer have the right to pay double for the agents error or stick it where the sun dont shineYes  Yes  And sadly yes Never    and I mean    never again  
P => Swank swank swank The W does scream quotswankquot   no doubt about it  Im easily impressed by hotels that go the extra mile on this sort of stuff so I was in heaven  They have an extremely clever keting team that have done a incredible job of making the guest feel welcomed and special  Everyone I came in contact with was very helpful and aimed to please  The Whiskey Bar on the top floor is small but a great place to grab a drink at the end of the night  Im not sure that its worth the typical rate but if you are looking for the quotwowquot factor and havent been its definitely worth it  
P => Its True You Really CAN Dress Up a Pig Like many have noted the first impression of the W Lakeshore is all about the design   from the cute pillows on the oh so trendy ottomans tucked inside the entrance to the cascading orchids and curvy wood chairs in the lobby   its all about the trendy or  Ive stayed at this hotel twice in the last two months and I can say with certainty that all of the shimmery velvety meant to wow appointments in the lobby dont mean jack  The hotel is nothing special  If you can afford the  Whatever Whenever  celebrity milk baths and bottles of Cristal in your fancy smancy suite then be it d be better but most of you will have an experience more like mine checking into one of their regular rooms On both of my trips we pulled into the parking area and were not greeted or welcomed  No one offered to help with bags  The lobby is nifty though as someone else noted some people  not like it at all   my mother for instance would squirm in a place that tries so hard to scream its quotcoolnessquot  Check in was efficient for both of my stays  We had a lake view room  The view of the lake and pier is nice but there is something that looks like a water treatment plant taking up a lot of the view There are issues with the room themselves too  Its your basic hotel room   entry with alcove closet with no door and no floor so no where to store shoes really  There is a mini bar bathroom and bed s with a desk across from it  There is the ubiquitous chair and tiny table and thats that  As many have noted there is an odd pass through with shutters in the wall between the bathroom and rest of the room  The first time I stayed at this hotel the shutters were broken and would not stay closed  The second time I stayed here the shutters worked fine but the entire room steamed up the one time someone was able to take a shower that actually included hot water  The appointments in the room are Ikea like   inexpensive but trendy minimal and contemporary  But add a flowery bedspread and take away the orative pillow and you could be in any motelhotel anywhere  What they describe as a chaise is actually an armless chair Sounds carry in the room and listening to others using the toilet is not my idea of a good time  Speaking of noise the walls seem very thin sound carried from housekeepers in the hall the people having sex next door televisions and CD players  It was loud unless I turned my own TV on There is no microwave in the room or coffeemaker though you can get a coffee maker if you ask for it  When I did I was sent one cup and nothing to stir with  I found the bathroom items to be OK in quality but small in size  They really don t hold enough for more than one person  The way they promote their  sinkside six spa experience  you really expect more  And that sums up what the real problem is with this place  They have clever keters who know how to give everything a sheen of nice making it all sound lux but its lipstick on a pig  Useless  A good example is the bathrobe they leave in rooms  ONE bathrobe  Nice but I wonder how many people feel irritated at having to call housekeeping to request a second one for a tip  Better hotels think ahead about the things that really matter and don t inconvenience their guests nearly as much as W The beds are OK  I found them rather hard though I appreciated the abundance of pillows  They are mattresses set on boxes constructed from what looks like plywood painted brown  Use care when approaching the bed since the frame goes all the way to the floor  We jammed our toes painfully into the side of the beds more times than I can count  Turns out there are reasons most beds have legs and a space underneath Our window blinds broke in the down position the chain coming off the track  The tub stopper completely came out of the tub when I tried to lift it out to drain water  Grout spilled from the tile into the tub whenever the shower was used  I noticed scuffs and wear and tear in almost everything in the room though not horribly so  This place needs to pay more attention to the details that really matter The local WGN TV channel doesn t come in right The repairman we called to try and fix it so we could watch a local hockey game said it s been broken for years and gave us some lame excuse about why  Thing is I live in the Chicago area also have Dishnetwork and my reception is just peachy  We were offered a free movie to make up for the trouble which was nice but it was on our bill when we checked out  So a freebie turned into another issue to deal with another hassle Someone mentioned how neat it was to come into the room for the first time to the CD playing and that IS a nice touch but not one they do for everyone  In both my stays I was met with silence  Only one of the rooms even had the CD laying there  The music was awful too very dance frantic beat type stuff that I imagine someone in W keting loves and thinks really sets their tone  It just made me antsy and irritated  Contrasting this is another hotel I love The Metro in Milwaukee that also has a signature CD that they actually do have playing in every room upon check in  It s jazzy  It s cool  It s the kind of thing anyone would find enjoyment in and most of all it complements the d cor and vibe so well that you truly do feel instantly transported to some chic yet soothing place  W s music is bad disco at best and only made me wince  W Lakeshore also has a problem with their hot water  On both stays at some point they ran out of hot water so we had chilly showers not fun in Chicago when it s in single digits outside The pool wasn t open on one of my stays and we were not notified when we made the reservation or upon check in  When we complained to the manager explaining that the entire reason for that trip was to give our dhter her birthday wish   time in a pool   we were told that some people had been given passes to the health club down the street  They must have been madder than I was for no one made me such an offer  About the hot water in the room she claimed engineering had checked and it was  fine   Only after telling her how horrible I thought her attitude was did she even offer anything to compensate for our miserable stay   she said if we ever came back that she would inspect our room personally  Gee thanks  If she actually did that for our second stay I have no clue but she missed the broken blinds and tub stopper and forgot to turn that CD on My second stay was more of the same  This time we ate at WAVE the restaurant  Very nice d cor again and the food was OK until we found something floating in my husband s beer and I found a bone in my duck croquettes  Service was slow and inattentive  The small plate concept leads to a lot of dishes when tables are not cleared  So I ended up eating with my elbows lifted to avoid dragging my sleeves through old dishes Oh and parking is  robbery  The coordination between parking and the front desk isn t very good  On my first visit they hadn t put the parking on the bill so my husband had to run back inside wait in line and handle it himself  Taxes are insane too  Bottom line   stay here only if you are concerned mostly with how things look on the outside  If you want service efficiency and a truly good hotel look elsewhere  
P => Great view   Good Location I was pleasantly upgraded to a Lake view room which is always nice The room was comfortable but heres a disclaimer  Because of the funky W styling there are a set of shutters in a window that erates the bathroom from the sleeping area  If youre traveling with a companion this would not allow for much privacy but if youre traveling alone it enables you to see the view of the lake while youre literally standing in your shower  The lobby bar area is fun but seemed to close rather early  
P => W Hotel was AWESOME I recently stayed at the W Hotel for my anniversary  I have stayed at almost every hotel in downtown chicago  The W Hotel was the best experience I have had at a hotel thus far  The view is superb the staff was very nice the valet had my car ready when I cam down the Sip and Stay is an awesome deal  And above all the Manager went well above and beyond for my anniversary by providing us with aTop Notch room and even chapagne AWESOME  The staff and especially management at this hotel made us have an awesome  year anniversay and we will definately return  Ignore any of the bad reviews because if I would have listeened to them I would have missed out on an awesome hotel  PS The pool has a view of Navy Pier and so does the gym  W  Wonderful Hotel  
P => W  does stand for Whatever but not Wow Went to Chicago for the first time on a guys weekend getaway  I had anticipated going for a long time even though it was winter we are all from the south so its a nice change  We have W Hotels in our city and have always had a good reputation so seeing that Chicago had one right on the lakeshore we were all in  Hotel or lived up to its boutique reputation and the staff seemed accomodating even moved us to a room overlooking the lake and Navy Pier  The problems arose with the rooms itself  very small and the bathrooms have no privacy being that they have sliding bamboo slats for doors and louvered window doors on the oposite wall  If your by yourself or with a significant other then it  not be an issue but with mixed company it was awkward  Our second night we were invaded by a cheerleading group who were there for a competition    needles to say they did not se the expense on insulation  heard every word in fact their phone rang and I reached to pick up mine  Bars within the Hotel are very pricey  for a mixed drink What this Hotel has going for it is the view and the location relevant to downtown and Michigan avenue  There are better Hotels out there for the same price do your research  
P => reasonable option for Chicago business travel Pretty well executed for a W  A bit out of the way for business or high end leisure travelers but always plenty of cabs to make up for that  Good service at the Port Cochere and check in  Lobby and lobby bar a bit tight and everyday for a W  Room lakeview and high floor was typically sized and had the Starwood bedding one expects  Bathrooms were what they were    great for a solo traveler not ideal otherwise  Walls thin as paper    I was prepared to have to have security bounce out the room next doors guests but they were respectful enough to move upstairs to the bar by a reasonable hours  Exhorbitantly priced Starwood internet service skipped  Room service adequate other services not tested Top points a very spacious and very well equipped gym  One of the best hotel gyms Ive been to in a while    all the basics no spa frippery either  
P => Great Hotel If You Get A Good Rate This is also one of those quotsuper swankquot hotels as I call them  The or is ultra modern and the door service is very good not nearly as good amp polite as quotThe Jamesquot though  The room is a ent size great flat screen plasma in the room nice view of Lake Michigan and super modern design  Bed is comfortable and theres a ent sized desk area for the business traveler and nice area to kick back relax and watch some TV  I got a deal through Starwood where I was able to fork over something like  points which is very minimal and pay something like  per night for the room I consider this hotel worth anything under  a night based on others in the area   above that there are better hotels out there unless everything is really jacked up in the area for a big event  If I had paid something like  a night like some of the other reviewers   I would give this place a terrible rating but at roughly  per night I think its a great place to stay if you want to be super hip amp trendyIn the end the bed amp pillows are always great   the W these rooms are nice the or is ultra modern the lounges are super hip and the place always has that young New YorkLA style hip hop vibe to it  
P => practically perfect This W made me feel like Goldilocks it was just right  Fantastic location   just far enough from Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier   fantastic City and lake views all the usual W comforts and a friendlier staff than the usual W hipper than thou crowd  We wouldnt think of staying anywhere else next time were in town  
P => Make sure you ask for lake view room The hotel itself is a typical W   very cool lobby chic bar nice outside sitting area  The rooms themselves are tiny and the bathrooms provide zero privacy because of the shutters that they installed between the room and the bathroom  The beds are amazing  Unfortunately we got stuck with a quotcity viewquot room which translates to looking onto a roof of a building and the pavement below  If you go to the top floor however you can check out the view of the lake  
P => Good experience overall Overall we had a great stay at the W Chicago Lake Shore  Some positives   View and proximity to Navy Pier are great  The or of the hotel is really done well  Beds are the most comfortable Ive ever slept in  The service and staff were above average  Negatives   ask for a room without a connecting door   we could hear every word the people in the next room were saying  Luckily we had very different schedules so it wasnt too much of a problem  Also   I would have to agree with the other comments about the bathroom  Although it is a neat look there leaves little to the imagination with the window between the bathroom and rest of the room  It was about   blocks from the Magnificent mile so if you want to stay right in the thick of things this might not be the hotel for you  At night on the weekends the beuatiful people do come out  The lobby turned into a clubby atmosphere which really isnt my thing  
P => Great Surprise Weekend in Chicago We are starwood preffered guest members and got a rate of  for a saturday night so we jumped on it for a quick getaway  We arrived to a th floor lakefront view and a great little room  The hotel looked really nice  The lobby was really cute as most Ws are and the gym looked amazing  Pool didnt look too bad either but we didnt use it  WE had drinks at the bar and the bartenders were great  We went to see a show so we took a cab  When we got back later that night they had a DJ in the lobby so we had a few tinis  We went back up the room and ordered room service which was just find until there was a long blonde hair actually inside my burger which ruined the meal  The next day we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was excellent and then we went to the spa and each had an  minute treatment that was excellent  The spa was very nice and I took advantage of all the locker room amenities  Overall it was very nice minus the roomservice mishap  The rooms are very modern but clean  The only major flaw was that the room is small to begin with and the put slat wood sliding doors and a window on the bathroom so there isnt much privacy  I lhed that the mini bar had emergency contraception supplies next to a W teddy bear as well as room service breakfast that was fruit whipped cream chocolate syrup champagne and hold your calls for an hour for   
P => Stayed here  years in a row and loved it For the past five years we have booked   rooms at the W lakeshore for our yearly sometimes bi yearly shopping vacations  We love the view and the atmosphere and the location  We are always catered to and the service is very kind The hotel rooms are cleaned and well cared for  And if we want an upgrade they almost always upgrade us right away and if not they offer it a day or so after we have arrived We travel with  adults  teenager childrenLast year we even met snoop dogg who was staying at the hotel  
P => Great Hotel   Nice View I stayed at the W Chicago Lakeshore while traveling for business during a packed convention week  The hotel is very modern and exactly what you would expect from a W hotel  The room had dark furnishings and the most comfortable bed with tons of pillows  The bathroom was modern yet compact with an interesting french door window opening to the room which made it feel more spacious  The closets and storage were abundant and very well organized  The hotel is literally on Lakeshore drive near the Navy Peir which has shopping and several restaurants  Its a short walk to Michigan Ave and more shopping and restaurants  The lobby is very cool with several lounge areas a bar and an excellent restaurant  There is also a very popular nightclub on the top floor Overall I was impressed with the location and really liked the hotel  
P => Sexy Hotel This hotel is recommended for young couples looking for an energetic hotel with club scene and trendy bar  The hotel is contemporary with flare  Beware the room bathrooms do not have doors for privacy only shutters that do not lock so if you are a private person request the handicap room  Location is awesome  Walking distance to the Navy Pier through an underground walkway about  blocks distance  Chicago city life is awesome and a great place to have a romantic getaway Hotel is upscale but rooms are slightly older  View is awesome to the lake  Food is way too expensive but you can eat breakfast at Egg cafe just  blocks to the right  Beware of parking fees  Get a deal with parking included  
P => Get a way to Chicago My wife and I spent two nights at W Lakeshore  This was the first time I have ever stayed at a W hotel  We both had a wonderful time  Lobby The Lobby was great we arrived at  p m  local time and there was no wait  Desk help was very helpful explaining anything we needed to know about the hotel  The lobby bar was great as well I spent some time there when my wife used the spa  You can even bring your drinks out on the front sidewalk to sit and look out at the lake Room Nice city room  We had a King room facing the lake  The view was great  I liked the spa bathroom  Some  be put off by the shutters and open theme  After ten years together it was fine for my wife and I  Very clean and great housekeeping service LocationExtras Great location  We walked to shopping and dining on Michigan Ave and Navy Pier is close as well  There is a  and Starbucks one block to the West if you dont want to raid the expensive mini bar  They offer free Acura car service anywhere in the city one way  Drinks are expensive both in the lobby bar and Whiskey Sky but that is what you get in a city  Smoke is no longer a problem When will Michigan ever get rid of smoking My wife was happy with her massage at the Spa located in the hotel We were both very pleased with the W Lakeshore  Im sure it is not as nice as Trump or the Park Hyatt but it does not cost nearly as much  If you are a   something or still live life like you are then book here  You will enjoy it  
P => Very Pleasant Stay I took a friend of mine to Chicago for a night of RampR and we would most certainly go back Although I read a lot of poor reviews when doing my online research I still chose the W for various reasons  Fortunately I realize a majority of those who post here are completely disgruntled and need a place to vent   and typically   of those who are disgruntled are normally hard to please anyhow  I have high end taste but also realize the W is NOT the Waldorf Astoria  The W Lakeshore is a boutique hotel   meaning it is NOT your standard Holiday Inn riott etc  The or is considered somewhere between modern and quotzen ishquot  Although the lobby area is a little congested we knew we didnt plan on staying in the lobby all night anyhow     A few days before we arrived   I received a quotwelcome emailquot  The email suggests if you have any quotwishquot to make your trip even more joyful to please contact the quotWhateverWheneverquot desk  I thought it would be nice to have a bottle of wine delivered to the room while we were getting ready for dinner to quotunwindquot  I received a response the same day indicating we were upgraded to lake view accomodations and would have a complimentary bottle of wine awaiting us at pm  WHICH WE DIDAcura also has a program with the W   which provides complimentary car service to any place you want to go  We were picked up at pm by a driver in an amazing Acura MDX  We felt like we were being chauffered in luxury and we WERE compared to the taxi service  The following morning we ided we wanted a later check out then pm their standard checkout time and they graciously honored us a pm checkout with no issues at all  The W was VERY accomodating  As long as you check your attitude at the door realize that its a HOTEL and again   not a PENTHOUSE stay    the staff are very helpful pleasant and will do everything in their power to make your stay a memorable one  YES    the bathroom DOES have a sliding door and a window that faces the sleeping area covered by shutter doors    unless your an absolute prude who needs complete privacy    I found the change delightful and interesting  I also loved the complimentary Bliss Spa prodcuts  I really liked the extra high beds as well  They were very comfortable and loved the pillowy effect  My ONLY complaint regarding our stay is that when the air conditioning fan seemed to automatically turn off   it would get a little muggy before it would switch back on   and the hall leading to the elevator was a little muggy as well  I wouldnt consider this a big enough issue to allow it to ruin my stay or my opinion of the W 
P => TERRIBLE experience ghastly design flaws We just returned from a trip to Chicago where we stayed at the W Lakeshore  The location of the hotel is pleasant overlooking as its name suggests beautiful Lakeshore Drive and Lake Michigan  The atmosphere especially downstairs is about what you might expect from W properties a veneer of swankiness complimented by thumping techno music and a bar scene that befits a eurotrash pick up bar more than a hotel lobby  When we arrived bleary eyed from a red eye from the west coast this was not the sort of greeting we wanted but we accepted it as the W brand  Fine  The rooms however showed the the swankiness and design consciousness of the brand is just a veneer that masks some rather awful poorly thought out design choices that run counter to the quotWhatever Wheneverquot comfort philosophy espoused by every staff member from the front desk to the room service servers  First the bathrooms  As other reviewers have pointed out the bathroom is arated from the bedroom by a shuttered window  The idea behind this design is understandable sensible and shared by a number of many a luxury hotel such as the Park Hyatt in Chicago or the St  Regis in San Francisco    while you take your bath or shower you can look out both onto your lovely tastefully appointed bedroom as well as a splendid view of the city  In execution the W falls flat on its face  The above mentioned hotels that share this design concept use a sliding partition that can block out the sound of the bathroom at night the shutter system used in the W rooms does nothing to block out sound and the problem is compounded by the fact that the toilet at least in our room though I know it is a feature in most rooms is not located behind its own door  So lets say youre trying to fall asleep in your lovely bed and at say  a m  your significant other has to get up and use the bathroom    youll hear everything heshe does  Some might call this intimacy we thought this terribly off putting  When we raised this issue with the hotel staff they apologized but said that all rooms were like this and that this was part of the hotels charming design forward aesthetic  Our response is this aesthetic scatalogical The second problem is the ac system  While we had set the temperature to a usually comfortable  degrees at night we woke up numerous times overheated  I kept running over to the thermostat to try to ensure that the system was working  We understandably called a maintenance person who informed us that the ac system is controlled by a motion sensor  Being from green conscious California the idea of saving energy through motion sensing technology is a good concept and we applaud the W for that effort but once again the design was flawed  If you are in the room the lights are out and youre in bed sleeping this means that there is no motion in the room  So no matter how low you set the temp youll be burning up around am  In sum we would only recommend this ill conceived and poorly re developed property to someone who got a rate for well under the advertised rack rate  For all the design flaws and we only mentioned two the regular room rate should not be around  in the summer  This hotel is a blemish on the Starwood brand  If youre already paying  for a regular king sized bed for two people at the W save yourself the aggravation and stay at a nicer property and in Chicago there are plenty  
P => eh   We stayed in what is billed as a quotspectacular roomquotThe view certainly was   The room   stylish but small for  night The lounge downstairs had only one server the night we went andthe concierge left early as well There was a skeleton crewpretty much everywhere after   We enjoyed the atmosphere ie furnishings but this hotel needs work on consistency  Some of the employees were great others not so great I would have been happier if it didnt cost so much and deliver so little  
P => an okay experience My partner and I stayed at the W Chicago Lakeshore for a night at the end of  in  We stay at W hotels a lot and we know what to expect from them  In contrast to other W hotels in general we found the staff to be adequately professional knowledgeable and friendly but we did not get the quotwowquot experience that the W always talks about from any of them  We had made a special request that they obtain a Wallpaper guide to Chicago for us in advance of our arrival and they came through on that with flying colors  I want to give them credit for that as it is not a standard request  Yet we were not blown away by the staffs knowledge professionalism nor the anicipation of our needs and wants as we have been at other W hotels   including the W Chicago   City Center We appreciate a friendly bellhop that bothers to ask what were doing in town if were looking for anything special makes suggestions and takes the time to show us where things are in the room  At the W Chicago   Lakeshore we just got the quotheres your room there are your bagsquot treatment  Okay but not impressive The rooms are beautiful although a bit small  We had a lake view room and it was nice but I didnt find the view to be all that spectacular  The privacy in the bathroom isnt much because there is an open window between bathroom and bedspace and as another reviewer commented its only closed off by wooden shutters The design of the public areas is quite lovely especially the bathrooms in the lobby area which offer floor to ceiling opaque glass so that you can see ghostly figures between the mens and womens bathrooms only by the handwashing sinks  The lobby is rather small for a W Hotel so we were disappointed upon going downstairs at around  pm to have a drink in The Living Room the lobby that there was no room for us to do so The one feature that did impress us was the restaurant  They were offering Pan Asian specials when we were there and the wait staff was top notch  Its not cheap but what we had was worth it  We booked a one day stay at the Lakeshore to check it out and then booked the remaining two nights of our stay in the W Chicago   City Center because it was cheaper  We thought wed be missing the W Chicago   Lakeshore after what wed read about the City Centers small rooms and dark lobby but we were very glad that we had booked our two night stay at the City Center instead  The location of the W Chicago   City Center is much better for doing things downtown their staff seems much more personable and capable and their concierge department is out of this world  The interior design is opulent using projections on the high ceilings and large glass vases holding strings of orchids in water If one is trying to ide between the W properties in Chicago I would suggest booking a larger room at the City Center as the small rooms are apparently very very small  Still I bet you can get a larger room for less at the City Center and it is a lot more W ish than is the Lakeshore   if you go for all that funky W kind of stuff  
P => Who Puts a Window in the Bathroom that Faces the Beds Okay Ive stayed in some run down places but come on W I expected much more than a window with shutters in the bathroom that opened into the bedroom right next to the bed Who designed that Were they thinking when they did that to the room To the bathroom A bathroom is a sanctuary of peace and private business doing not a place where everyone and their mothers can hear and smell sorry people everything you do I cant tell you how many times my companions and I talked about using the facilities up stairs  COME ON W you are not what you claim to be  I was totally uncomfortable  Oh and thanks for putting horrible air conditioners that ran loudly all night  Ugh never again 
P => a very expensive disappointment My husbands secretary booked us at the W because of the view of the lake right across the street  The photos on line looked trendy and appealing so we were excited When we arrived it must have been prom night making the lobby pretty chaotic  The front desk rep  was cavalier when she told us we werent getting a lake view room after all  No further explanation was offered  Instead she said we would get a quotcity view quot This turns out to be a euphemism for a view of the office building directly behind the hotel and a roof top full of exhausts Our room was a huge disappointment It was very small and had no real privacy between the bathroom and bed area just wooden shutters The bathroom had no exhaust fan no heat lamp and the lighting was ridiculous  Good luck putting on make up  One robe was provided for two guests The beds were solid to the floor watch your toes and too high up  There were no blankets only a sheet with a bedspread There was no or to speak of just a ceramic cup with pods sticking straight up and one small frame on the wall with several vertical sticks inside  There were no lamp shades only strips of cloth hanging from the wire frames  BizarreThe snack bar items were not priced but we found out they were very pricey along with everything else at this hotel  A poached egg and two orange juices set us back over   We ate at their lobby restaurant The Wave which has a modern look and sound  The food was extremely expensive and only mediocre  My glass of house champagne was  We had a rough time sleeping due to the noisy on and off all night of the cooling system and the loud slamming of the hall doors during the night  I imagine a lake view room would partially offset the negatives of this hotel but well never know  Were not about to go back 
P => W Chicago   Watch Out   This place is awful I will echo every bad review ever written for the W Lakeshore in Chicago and then some  When the cab dropped me off on Friday night I thought I had walked in the wrong door as there was a full on club scene going on  Only when I walked in a few more feet did I realize that the lobby of the hotel also doubled as the barclubconcierge stand  As a matter of fact when I walked in on Saturday night I immediately was met with several people screaming  watch out watch out  to look down and see that I was standing in a puddle of broken glass and someone s cocktail   So I didn t like the lobby ok  Let s talk staff  The maintenance staff was super nice and friendly as was our waitress each morning at breakfast  Every other employee that I interacted with was rude off putting and a snob  Really You work in a remodeled Days Inn Check yourself Ah but this is all just common areas isn t the W known for their beautifully orated rooms comfortable beds Bliss product etc Well remember this is really a remodeled Days Inn so the rooms are SMALL not much room to get around and the beds are raised up super high  I m   and I still had a difficult time getting in and out of bed no I m not elderly either  Although very pretty and of course who doesn t like Bliss product the regulated heatair conditioner unit went off every  minutes all night for the first  nights I was there  You know that generator humming noise Yep that s it  The rd and final night it didn t turn off at all I was awake all night  And yes every morning I asked that someone go in and adjust the unit so I could get some sleep  With rolled eyes  Yes sure  We ll take a look at it today   be they did be they didn t all I know is that I was exhausted  I spent  a night at this hotel and I couldn t sleep I love Chicago and will keep visiting but I will NEVER stay at this hotel or even meet a friend for a drink  Awfull 
P => The  W  is Not a Winner This is the most guest unfriendly hotel i have ever stayed at and not one professional among the staff It was as though everyone was untrained in the business  Half hour to hour long waits each day for the concierge bad disco greeting you at the door    you know that its bad when you hear Alvin the Chipmunk over a droning ostinato of disco  No complimentary water for   per night  poor lighting in the rooms  impossible for makeup  and the rudeness of the staff who were sure they were quotthe Chosenquot for working in this very Hip joint were just a few of my complaints  The bartender scowled at me for asking for ice water when i came in sweaty from a  mile run and without eye contact slammed the glass down about  feet away from my reach and shot me a look of death when i reached for a piece of lemon  When i related the incident to the manager she was not able to listen because she was the only person in the lobby who could tag luggage and was busy at the moment  At breakfast i stood in line in back of a couple who were seated immediately by a waitress who never bothered to tell me that I was standing in the wrong place and that there was a hostess station behind the pillar  I remained invisible and only by luck saw a hostess who then informed me of a twenty minute wait for a table while i watched her seat walk ins within  minutes from the bar where i resigned myself to ordering and eating a very cold bowl of oatmeal without salt or sugar or water served with it as I watched INCREDULOUSLY the lack of help by the staff toward an elderly man that could not manage the steps with his walker the lobby is not handicapped equipped and the GUESTS jumped in to assist him   The Bell boy must have stacked  pieces of luggage on top of each other and just kept taking more and more for fear of lost tips without any regard to laptops falling or anyother sensitive items that might have been damaged  It was a totally untrained staff  The lobby is set up so that guests coming in through the doors and exiting out through the doors intersect the guests spilling out of the elevators at the same time that they will inevitably bump into the lines waiting for the concierge and the baggage that is being loaded onto the carrier  There simply is no room to do business here in this lobby  A VERY POOR DESIGN The chamber maids and the staff behind the scenes were very responsive and polite and made up for the lack of management all the way around  This place is understaffed undertrained  and full of itself 
P => Everything you expect from a W Hotel If you have ever stayed at a W Hotel then the W Chicago Lakeshore will not disappoint  Ive stayed various W Hotels in NYC San Francisco etc and do so for the modern hip style and happening bar scene  If you prefer a more business type or relaxing hotel you might want to look somewhere else Location   It was my first visit to Chicago and found the W to be very centrally located to everywhere I went  I found everything to be a  minute or less walk  Only cab I needed was to the airport Lobby Bar amp Restaurant   Yes the lobby is busy and loud  Pretty much all day every day  But I never had a problem with the front desk or getting a drink at the bar  Ate at the restaurant on Friday night which was okay  I recommend eating out some where else if you can Room   My room looked just like the pictures so no surprises there  Room is not small but no big either  It was pretty close in size to hotel rooms in NYC and San Fran  Bed was comfortable and TV had good selection of channels  There is also a DVD player and clock radio with Ipod hookup  Not a lot of closet space but enough for a weekend stay  Newspaper was delivered outside the door every day Service   Along with the vibe W hotels are known for their service and the W Chicago Lakeshore did not disappoint  Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful  I especially enjoy the Ws quotwhatever wheneverquot service  On Saturday evening before dinner I called asking if the hotel had any sugar free redbull  They said they dont carry it but would get me some  About  minutes later  cold cans were delivered to my door  The charge on the bill was less than  delivery included  I was told they can fill almost any request for a price Overall   I enjoyed my stay at the W Lakeshore and would definitely stay there again  
P => Not a business class hotel The hotel has the W veneer but under that is a not very good business class hotel  This property was converted from a Days Inn and it shows  While on the surface the property has all of the exuberant hipness for which the chain is known underneath its just not a very upscale hotel  As others have noted the rooms are oddly shaped with small bathrooms and no closets loud HVAC systems no sound insulation between rooms and only a single electrical outlet on the desk all holdovers from its time as a Days Inn  Worse even on such things as service there are gaps    a requested  am wakeup call one day came at  am and another  am wake up call never came at all  I agree with others if youre here for the party and dont care about the accommodations have fun  If you actually want  need a business hotel you can do better  
P => Not that great     I looked at the previous reviews and figured I would still give this hotel a try  Well I am amazed at how correct the previous reviewers where rating this hotel  The lobby had dirty seating the reception desk staff was not very interesting in helping guests  My room was small strange layout and in need of a reation  The food was just OK  The one thing that I did like was the spa gym and it was close to Michigan Avenue  Otherwise I would skip this hotel until they go through a major overhaul  Jacqueline Smith 
P => Faded and Tired No Longer Hip I stayed at the W hotel for a business meeting for  days and was completely unimpresed  I suppose the lobby is okay but thats about it  I remember when these W hotels were kind of cool hip and trendy about  years ago but when I stayed at this place is just didnt work for me  I actually found the so called trendiness way too over bearing and the cutesy phrases etc almost annoying The worst for me though was the rooms  My room did not face the lake so the view was of an offfice building  The room was small  The satinish bedsheets were stained and the walls had nicks in them  The furnishing looked cheap tired and worn out  I found the fact that the closet is just an alcove with a sheet over it kind of weird  And the fact that the bathroom was basically not arate from the main room was odd too given the price of this place My room wasnt cleaned the first day until around PM when the maid came by and asked my reluctantly if I wanted a room cleaning I definitely wouldnt stay here on my own dime  
P => fun hip hotel The W Lakeshore is one of the best hotels Ive ever stayed at hands down  I travel a lot for business and have stayed at some very high end places    but the W has a style all its own that really fits with my lifestyle Ill start first by saying that the W wont be for everyone  They cater to the   and  something traveler with a little more money to spend on interesting atmosphere  This is not an ornate old hotel with giant chandeliers and the kind of service that goes with a stuffy ambience  As an example theres a dessert on the room service menu called quotFantasyquot strawberries whipped cream chocolate syrup and a disposable camera  There ya go  Also the ladies room in the main lobby has mirrored panels that are actually  way mirrors so that as youre checking your lipstick the people on the other side can see you  LCD walls in the lobby play clips from quotMoulin Rougequot the lobby becomes a bar at night the wall behind the reception desk is sequined  Much of the atmosphere is fun tongue in cheek with a little bit of edge I found my room to be very comfortable and cozy done in grays and purples    the Bliss bath products were a great touch I can tell you that the set of toiletries you get each day sells in hora for   I found the food to be pretty good except the  Kobe burger on the room service menu wasnt worth the  but fun to try  Other nice touches in the gym they have a fridge with moist towels so that you have an ice cold towel to wipe off with after your workout  Your wake up call isnt a recording its a live person saying quotsorry to interrupt your dreams    shall we call you back in a few minutes its cold out today please bundle up quot They play ambient lounge music in the elevators which changes slightly throughout the day so that at night the music goes more with the barlounge vibe of the lobby  They have a quotpillow menuquot so that you can select the perfect pillow to get a good nights sleep Id stay at the W again in a heartbeat  
P => hip and expensive hotel The W Lakeshore is a hip and modern hotel  The room is a ent size for Chicago  The bed is very comfortable with lots of great pillows  The bathroom has great bath products   Bliss lots of towels and wonderful bathrobe  Lots of hot water and good water pressure  The towels could have been thicker  The light in the bathroom doesnt provide lots of light but the cutout window to the bed area helps  There is plenty of desk space for work and a large flat screen tv  Issues  the heatfan was hard to control  it would suddenly be cold and I had trouble turning it off  Internet   not wireless and  day Room Service  prompt and good food but breakfast was  Each room service order automatically includes a  service charge plus   tip  The same menu is downstairs at half the price Clock  the clock is hard to set for the alarmUmbrella   I rented an umbrella and was told of the  charge if not returned  I returned it at the end of the day but the charge was on my bill  I called the front desk and they promptly removed the charge Location     blocks from Michigan Ave  closest Starbucks is about  blocks The room service and restaurant food is very good  The dinner at the restaurant was reasonablely priced  The upstairs bar has great views of the city In general the customer service was very good  I had a wake up and back up call that was prompt and reliable  I was a little concerned given I couldnt set the room clock Overall my stay was fine  For the price there is room for improvement  
P => Not Bad But You Can Do Better This is not a bad hotel and there is nothing really wrong with it  However there is nothing really spot on about it nor anything that makes it above average or more than a ent hotel experience  On the plus side the location is ent on Lake Shore Drive the beds were very comfortable and I found the staff friendly and eager to please  The color scheme in the room is nice however that doesn t mask the fact that it is cheap furniture and crummy stuff done in a way to try to give it an ultra cool vibe that doesn t hide its cheapness     for instance the lights at the side of the bed are bulbs with a cheap wire frame and white sheet like material around them as was the stand up light delivered to the room that we had to call down for so that we could read  There was an armless chair with no ottoman making it fairly uncomfortable but they did deliver an ottoman after we called You pay for internet access    per day  Room service was ent except that morning coffee was awful      you can taste the coffee filter  Other room service meals  one lunch and one dinner were perhaps a bit more than fine     nothing great but nothing awful  The restaurant was adequate  The service could be improved  they were very slow but at least friendly  I did eat at the bar one day as I was hungry around  PM  I was surprised to see a woman at the bar who looked like a hooker  I honestly did think she was a hooker  She turned out to be the bar waitress  Her outfit would have been appropriate in the evening but honestly at PM it was way too over the top for me and looked a little seedy As other reviewers have noted the bathroom set up is not very good  There are two shutters with slats in them that form a window which can be opened into the sleeping area  I have no idea what the design idea was behind this other than someone elevated form over function or was trying to be uber cool and was instead uber talentless  The bathroom door is a slider made out of the same material and was off its track  We had to lift it to open and close it but that wasn t a big deal  I just would not rush back to a hotel where you can hear everything in the bedroom that is going on in the bathroom and the bathroom has no ventilation I was told by friends who live in Chicago that this hotel used to be a Holiday Inn and that makes sense to me       the ceilings in the rooms were not quite cottage cheese but also not really nice smooth ceilings and looked out of place for a W Hotel  There were also one or two stainsspots on the comforter that I was too tired to complain about  and they were quite small  The comforter did otherwise appear clean as did the room in general In sum there was nothing overly offensive about this hotel although there were some issues  However there was also nothing impressive or that made it anything more than a ent hotel experience  If you want a great hotel or a great hotel for the money I advise you to keep looking  
P => Dated Dirty Worn Out Furniture  We booked this through Starwood as a Preferred Member  First of all we travel a great deal  I believe the people who wrote great reviews dont stay in many hotels  This quothipquot hotel is a quotdated hip quot Meaning the furniture in the lobby is worn out and filthy  The carpeting is worn out hardwood flooring in need of refinishing  The elevators are dirty  The rooms are the worst  Basically modern quotSaunderquot put together type furniture     really cheap  Worst part is the bathrooms in the rooms themselves  There is a large window from the bedroom with louvers that can be opened from the bedroom along with the sliding louver door  There is no privacy in the bathrooms and no exhaust fan  We have NEVER seen such a poor design The Whiskey Bar    we love tinis and looked forward to this  However it is the smallest bar in any hotel we have ever seen  At night they pump the music and its standing room only    just try and get a drink  The Lobby of this hotel looks okay at night lots of candles  Just dont look at it during the day  
P => dont want to stay anywhere else Stylish good customer service all the little details were right cool restaurant in the lobby cant think of anything that shouldve gone better than it did especially at the deal I got online 
P => Great hotel Recently stayed at this hotel for  nights and I thought it was great  The location is really good and the hotel has the hip cool W vibe that I love  Positive points beds were incredibly comfortable giving the Westin Heavenly bed a run for its money shower pressure was perfect wonderful flat screen HD TV both room service and food in the restuarant were very good and the service was top notch Negative points bathroom was pretty small not a lot of privacy with the sliding door and area that opened into the bedroom and the lighting was not so great in the bathroom  Dont get me wrong   its great quotmood lightingquot just not so great for putting on make up  Overall I would definitely stay here again  And make sure you ask for a view of the lake   even though it was frozen and snowing it was beautiful  
P => Great hotel but damn the details    We arrived Saturday afternoon and took advantage of the valet parking  We checked in quickly and then walked to our room  The room was dirty Unmade bed beer cans on the night stand etc  We call the front desk the lady apologizes numerous times and were reassigned to another room  No upgrade was asked for or offered  Problem   came later that night with loud music coming from somewhere some other floor we figure  Problem   came after we checked out and left the hotel  My wife kept commenting that she smelled smoke in our vehicle neither of us smoke and shes pregnant and very sensitive to odors  After awhile we noticed a cigarette bud on the passenger side floor and ashes at the front bottom of the window sill on both the driver and passenger doors Unacceptable issues in our opinion  The hotel is cool hip and kets itself as a step above the rest  We enjoyed the room the bed and the amenities but the devil is in the details  It appears that the W corporation knows how to design and build a hotel but the local management doesnt know how to manage  How else can you sumize rooms being ked clean when theyre not and employees smoking in vehicles that have been entrusted to them Disappointing  
P => one of my fave hotels This is one of my favorite hotels to stay at Its right on the lake  The rooms are great   great layout or amount of space Cool bar  
P => Trendy with a great view I was able to stay at the W hotel Lakeshore with a family member that had a comp stay for a business trip  The hotel is located in front of Lake Michigan off Chicagos famous scenic Lake Shore Drive  The hotel room was very modern and hip and beds were comfortable   The bathroom looked really cool   but wasnt very practical  It was dark so it was tough to see clearly in the mirrors  There wasnt much sink space the shower was a bit tricky and there were slotted doors and windows connecting the bathroom to the bed area so you could hear everything  The view on the other hand was spectacular  It looked right onto Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  The hallways leading to the rooms reminded us off or taken from TLCs Trading Spaces with smooth pebblestones bordering the wallsfloor  We didnt take advantage of the fitness or pool area nor the restaurants but there is a great but expensive bar on the roof  Whiskey Room with one of the best views of Chicago at night  And there is a trendy bar on the first floor off the lobby that caters to the hip after work crowd  The location is a bit out of the way but walking distance to Michigan Avenue shoppingrestaurants and the John Hancock Building  The doorman can easily get taxis there as well  It is also pretty close cab ride to Navy Pier and to the AMC River East  movie theater  So overall if you are looking for a trend setting hip place thats a little pricey but has a great view this would be a place to go  
P => Super sweet and fun I needed to get away and ompress for a day  Chicago is very hard to beat  Found a great rate and booked it  My dhter and I stayed at the Downtown W last summer so I knew what to expect trendy and upscale  The positives were the big flatscreen cozy bed interesting viewin room safe and downtown location  You can walk to almost everywhere that matters  Great home base for shopping The downside is paper thin walls  At am I called the quotANYTHING ANYTIMEquot line for some earplugs  At am I called them back   never mind Need sleepy Also know it is  to park  Overall I would score the hotel a   Every employee was very kind and helpful  The room was cool clean and cheap  At checkout I told them about the earplug issue  Asked if they would take  off the parking  They said sure  
P => Always enjoy my stay at the W hotel  We were staying with family over the holidays but wanted a mini getaway and I found cheap rates on the internet for the last weekend of ember  It was night and we get points for Starwood so it was worth it for us  This is our second time here  I had put a note that I wanted a lake view room although at this price we shouldnt have  It helps that we are gold members of Starwood  I called and asked for a early check in and they accommodated us  We stayed in room   For the W it seemed like there were a lot of familieschildren during our stay  It didnt bother us since it was the holidays but during our last stay we didnt see families at all  Must have been the lower rates  The room was a king room and had a view of the Lake but it was foggysnowy  The room was clean and nice  Small but expected with all quotmodernquot rooms nowadays  The only thing I was surprised about was the tub part of the bath  Very outdated tub  The tiling and shower head were fine but it was like they forgot to replace the tub  Haha  The rooms also have satellite cable and a lot of the channels seemed to go in and out  I think it was due to the weather  The rooms of course have the Bliss products in there  Not much drawer space if you want to unpack though We went to the Bliss Spa that is connected and got massages and it was fabulous  They dont have couple massages which is a bummer  They have arate mens and womens areas  Theres a dry sauna and I recommend using the steam showers  They also have water tea and yummy lemonade  They serve cheese crackers cookies and brownies too  I would deifnitely stay again  
P => Rock n Roll I made a short trip to Chicago late summer  for the sole reason of visiting a dear friend who resides there I chose the W because it is close to quotdowntownquot however it enjoys a spectacular view of the lake which I find more restful Let me explain  Chicago is an awesome city and at least one visit should be on everyones quotto doquot list but I do find it quite frenetic and even as a born and bred Londoner it takes some energy to enjoy My pal warned me against the W saying it was a converted Days Inn however I took the plunge and it was a hoot The W is absolutely not a family hotel  It is however a young or young at heart persons ideal getaway  The rooms are little small I was upgraded to a fabulous suite overlooking the lake and the furnishing is a trifle kitsch however the staff are excellent and the barrestaurant is such a buzz that there is no need to risk a DUI by going out anywhere else in the eveningIf one word would describe the W its sex or if you need  its rock n roll  If you are young single or middle aged and lively you will love it  
P => Nice place to stay I booked the W for my husbands th birthday he loves the W  We checked in three hours early with no problems and received an upgraded oceanview  It was nice room a bit smaller than other Ws we have stayed at  We had a king size bed chaise lounge chair desk and two night stands  The bathroom was a normal size for a hotel in the city  The one weird thing is that there were large wooden shutters that you could open so you could be in the bathroom to look into the bedroom like a window almost or close them for privacy  The bar on the rd floor had a nice view but it was SUPER smokey  So we opted to go back down to the bar in the lobby  We had good service strong and expensive tinis  I guess what do you expect in the city  We didnt valet the car but it is  a day for those of you who drive to the city  The hotel is about four easy blocks from Michigan Ave which is a great location  There is a great little place for breakfast about two block west of the hotel   I believe it is called West Egg  Great food and MUCH cheaper than eating at the hotel  
P => W Chicago   Not for those who wants top service Yes its a W Hotel and its undoubtedly one of the hippest hotels in Chicago and yes it offers a stunning view of lake Michigan and yes the rooms are orated in such a way that you feel like you live in a lounge bar  If these are the things youre looking for then go for it  BUT if youre like me someone who also needs top quality attentive services then youll be supremely disappointed  Perhaps me and my wife need to be reminded that the word quotHIPquot is mutually exclusive with the word quotSERVICEquot  
P => You gotta be kidding Chicago is my hometown and I remember when this property was a Holiday Inn  It still is though in prettier packaging  Nice lakefront location and the Streeterville neighborhood offers a less intense nightlife scene than say RushDivision or Wrigleyville  I kinda like the W vibe though its a little forced  The W Lakeshore has so many service problems however that Ill be hard pressed to stay there again  Lets see   where to begin Would it be with the houskeeper   excuse me  stylist  who ignored the quotDo Not Disturbquot sign to pound on my door four times   on a Sunday   after I flew in from Taipei Perhaps I should mention the stylist who took my comforter and featherbed replacing them with thin blankets saying the hotel was out of clean conoftrets and featherbeds Or could it be the front desk staffer who called me to tell me about a FedEx delivery   and could not find it five minutes later Ugh  If youre Starwood the Sheraton Hotel and Towers is a much better bet  If not the Sofitel is awesome though the rooms are euro small  The Drake is nice if you like the old classy thing and Ive always had good luck at the Renaissance  
P => Worst Hotel in Chicago Here are some reasons why this is the worst hotel Ive ever stayed at  When I stored my luggage for the day the bell desk quotlostquot my luggage  Never to be found again   everything gone   Rooms are small  Bathroom is awkward with no real enclosure  Walls are super thin you can hear people merely talking next door  Customer Service lacks in all areas I got attitude when I got a simple cup of coffe at the lobby bar no one greets you when you come and go employees dont acknowledge you in the elevator  Got charged for items that I did not use and then questioned when I disputed them  Didnt have hot water for a shower in ember mind youThere are SO many other options in Chicago for people to stay and I recommend everyone stay elsewhere but here  
P => Cool Hotel The W on Lakeshore is a nice hotel  Please keep in mind that this hotel used to be a Holiday Inn or something lower end and Starwood remodeled a few years ago  The rooms are small but have everything you need for a weekend trip to Chicago or a business trip  The Bliss Spa is OK too pricey for the average quality of the products and services  The restaurant is OK and the SKY bar are OK  Again very small and lacking in creativity for the quotWquot brand  Nothing would make me say quotdont stay herequot but I also would consider other hotels such as the James  
P => Staff makes W great A girl friend and I stayed at the W in early ember for a girls trip to Chicago  We debated over staying on Michigan Ave to be closer to shopping and restaurants and bars but we ided on the W because of a good deal online  As soon as you walk into the lobby the music is playing and you can tell it certainly is geared towards a young crowd  The check in was absolutely seamless and quick very pleasant  The music in the elevators is a little loud   and is always on which is a bit much in the mornings  The room was small but not tiny by any means and we loved the or  The best parts of the room were the comfortable beds and the plasma tv  I would have to say that the lighting is a bit dark especially in the bathroom  Speaking of the bathroom there is a shuttered window which opens and closes facing the sleeping area so if you want privacy you wont get it   especially since there is no fan in the bathroom Could be uncomfortable   We were there from     th and were worried about the  to  block walk to Mich Ave and Rush street since it was cold but it wasnt too bad  In the summer the walk would not be an issue at all and if it had been warmer we probably would have taken advantage of being so close to Nave Pier and gone over there  The lounge bar Wave was WONDERFUL  The bartenders were very polite and attentive   we started every night there  It seemed like a very popular place and there was always a good sized crowd  All in all we probably could have paid a little less and stayed on Michigan Ave  If you have money to spend and want to be around a young hip crowd   stay here Recommendations in between shopping on Mich Ave have lunch at the Intercontinental dinner at Rockit Bar is a MUST and across the street is a fun Irish pub to hit up afterwards  
P => COOL Property Fantastic location wonderful view of Michigam lakeVery nice people and gilrs at the bar and restaurantStaff very helpfulmodern and cool roomsnice the fitness with swimming pool 
P => Making Improvements And Still A Great View You can see my earlier review complete with photos regarding our stay  Our earlier stay ember  was riddled with issues including the filthy pool and dark hallways and rooms  After writing to the W about the issues they we gracious enough to have us back for a complimentary stay  I can see that they have made improvements to a number of areas to address many of the comments here  On our stay this time we were in a velous Suite on the th floor   The view to Navy Pier and the lake was wonderful  Some improvements of note include There is now key card access to the elevators to prevent others from getting to your floor  They removed the river rock gutters and low lighting in the hallways replacing the carpeting and changing to much improved hallway lighting  The rooms themselves now feature white ceilings versus dark grey which drastically brighten up the rooms  In addition the huge bulky entertainment centers are gone along with the tube TV and cheap Fisher CD system replaced by a LG quot plasma screen and Bang and Olufsen BeoSound system  A great change indeed Doors and other things have been repaired and while some items remain a bit strange the shutters in the bathroom and just bad bathroom lighting overall they have made improvements from our stay just a year ago and management has been very good about addressing things noted in these reviews The location cant be beat but yes Michigan Ave  is a  cab ride away in the cold weather  You can walk it but bundle up  They have a bunch of CDDVD rentals available which were a nice touch  The lobby bar is OK with ent drinks at high prices  Parking is a bit steep at  and when looking at room service menus keep in mind that prices are  higher than the normal menu price plus a  delivery charge plus   gratuity  So your  OJ in the restaurant is actually   when using room service quite a bit more  The gym is pretty good and the pool looked much improved from our last visit  Check in speed was still a bit slow and the lobby can get congested with the comings and goings and check in desk all within a few feet of each other If you like the Ws in general you  feel a bit slighted by the room layouts and a few minor annoyances but overall the W Lakeshore is a pretty good place to stay when in Chicago  
P => ent but beautiful views of Lake  This hotel is definitely more for the younger crowd  The bar is often packed in the evenings which kind of filters into the hallway and lobby  We had an issue where they charged restaurant charges to our room that were not ours  It turned out the waitress did not check the signature to see if it matched the room  So please be very careful to review the bill before you check out The view is amazing if you have a lake side room which we did  That you cant beat  Also beware there is only a sliding door for a bathroom door and window shutters leave a open view between bathroom and room no privacy if you are sharing the room with another person  Overall the hotel was a ent walk to Chicago shopping and Michigan Avenue  Safe area but not the top pick  
P => Great View and Location We stayed here for a fun little get away in the city  Overall we had a great time  The lobby has alot of fun little areas to sit and hang out  The rooms were small but comfortable  We were on one of the top floors and I enjoyed the view of Lake Michigan  It took about an hour to check in  They gave us some drink vouchers to hang out at the lobby bar while we waited for the room to be ready  The rug was wet when we checked in be the carpet was just cleaned or there was a very large spill but since it took an hour to get in and they were booked we just dealt with it  Whiskey Sky isnt super impressive but its a fine place for before dinner cocktails  Some areas of the hotel seem a little warn down but you dont really notice it because the lighting is so dark  Ive gone to Bliss several times for facials and massages and I would have to say that it is one of my favorite spots for a facial but it somewhat depends on who gives your treatment  Overall a great place to be when you are going to be hanging out downtown  
P => Fun mod and sassy  TOP service  I stayed at The W Lakeshore on business and it was more than I had expected  I knew this property was a former Days Inn so that fact made me have low expectations of the rooms but from the moment I pulled up I was hit with superb service a sense of mod style and sass The Westin brand did an extreme makeover on the property to fit the W brand style  I loved the modern elegance and fun it all I found sassy humor around my room   from the Doggie Room Service Menu to some of the late night room service selections for couples only down to the way they give you the extra roll of toilet paper in your room Service was amazing   they had a lakeview room available last one and asked it I wanted it  Love the Bliss brand bath products they got me hooked and the food via room service was great  I watched fireworks out my window over Navy Pier certain nights of the week year round and the sunrise over the lake the next morning  I WILL DEFINITELY be staying back at this hotel again  I felt like a rock star More info on my stay can be found on my quottravelworkquot blog at      
P => A Westin by any other name Im double the age of a person on their s and I stay at Ws all the time  Its a just a glorified Westin without the quotestin quot This hotel is pretty well run  The food is adequate the rooms are well appointed and good looking while still retaining practicality  The view of the lack from the upper floors is great  The gym is big and roomy  The restaurant has a great outdoor area where you can look at the lake and passersby on a nice day  Room service is pretty fast if not   accurate  I would stay here next time Im in Chicago for business  They tend to tell you quotyesquot more often than quotno quot 
P => Nice place The hotel is really nice the room service is great The restraunt service is so good that when we wanted some ranch for the salad the server went to the local ket and got some  
P => Great for a single trendy in their s This W is like any other W hotel  Its meant purely for  year olds that want to stay at the trendiest hotel The standard rooms have a shower only  Bed is comfortable and the rooms are fairly comfortable  They overcharge for everything same as all Ws  Even wireless internet which is free in every other nicer hotel costs approx   a day  Lobby is filled with constant loudtrendy techno music  The upstairs bar at this one is too small cramped and too dark  Wasnt that nice   Overall in a city where you want a clean and reliable room that lacks another high end hotel to stay at a W hotel is always a reliable back up  
P => Delightful and deliciious I love this hotel  I stayed here for  days and was totally spoiled by the fabulous room and the great staff  Amy checked us in and she made that a flawless pleasure  The room rocked bed was killer the bathrobe was so comfortable I enjoyed the Bilss sink amenites the Asian inspired shower and bath and lovely lake view  I indulged in the BIlss spa which was great as always and highly recommend Gina and Serena for all spa needs you girls rock  I had breakfast at Wave which was pretty good Phillip was the server and hes so great  I did prefer the room service menu as it has better food more choices and the desserts rule I recommend the brownie it is so good  DIdnt go to the bar but checked out the pool and gym and both are pretty good  Everyone was helfpful friendly and great esp Christopher R  from WhateverWhenever service which we used a couple times this guy is the best Angela is also great  they will go out of the way to make you happy  I cant wait to stay here again this is my favorite hotel right now  
P => If you are trendy this is the place for you For someone over  who is from a small mountain town and therefore not quotupquot on trends this property was a bit out of my league  The feel of the place and the look of the room made me think of being in the quotinquot crowd and architecture digest respectively  The check in service had its ups and downs  Ups we were offered water when we pulled up and someone immediately came to take the luggage out of the car  The front desk was efficient as well  The down we were not allowed to use a luggage cart to take up our suitcases quotdue to insurance reasons quot Thats hogwash I usually use other hotels luggage carts with no problems  They just wanted the bellman to get a tip  There was always someone to open the door  At night there was even a quotbouncerquot near the elevators to our room so that someone from the public bar wouldnt stumble upstairs by mistake  The Bliss Spa was again wonderful went there last year  Had different treatments this year and still pleased with the facility and service  Wish the hotel wouldnt charge  for overnight parking though  The location is nice if you want to be near Navy Pier and the Lake  It was only   blocks from the Magnificent Mile so good shopping is nearby  The concierge is very helpful   they even had a shopping map of the area The rooms were very fung shwei spelling The colors were white and black  The bathroom was not fully enclosed  There were wooden shutters that opened to the bed area and the door was a sliding wooden one  Not the best if you want privacy in there   We used the incredible showers with eucalyptus in the spa so this wasnt a problem  The beds were nice  The quotgoody barquot was very expensive and included some items that you would not want to explain to kids if they found them   All in all a good stay if you can get a good rate like we did  Wouldnt pay the rack rates which start around night  We paid under night as a special promotion  Would recommend for a romantic weekend or a girlfriend spa weekend  
P => Over rated Over rated Just got back from the W for a long weekend and thought I would write my first review We stayed at the W due to a wedding we were participating in and thanks to our great friends we had a fantastic time and it was easy to overlook the problems  None the less unless you are there with a group there are clearly nicer and less expensive hotels in Chicago First off  The parking is a complete rip off  dollars anight plus the tip to get your car  There is a parking garage around the corner that is a little less and is within walking distance The W  trys to come off as a trendy modern hotel  Their staff certainly has the quotBeautiful Peoplequot look but beyond that the hotel really comes off as a run dow dimly lit holiday inn that was re furnished by IKEA       years ago The rooms are clean but small and worn  The bathroom is even smaller and only comes with a shower no tub  They have cut an open window between the bathroom and room to give the illusion that it is much larger than it is  The space is only closed by a set of shutters  Thus it does not allow for a lot of privacy and as my wife observed would not make the most romantic setting if you were there for the first time with someone you were dating In fairness the beds were awesome and we had a great nights sleep The bar was a lot of fun but anywhere and anytime we get together with our friends it seems like fun  They play a lot of that trendy disco style of music and you would fit in well if you have one of those cool kid club shirts to sport around in  That trendy disco music is blaring at all times in the hotel which lend itself to a vegas feel but gets a little tired after a while In short the hotel is not dirty  The room are adequate and clean the bed is very nice  But in the end so is a Fairfield by riot at a fraction of the price  We were excited to be staying at the quotWquot but felt that the hype was more than the expierance  Over Priced and Over Rated 
P => A Chicago Staple Though this hotel seems to get mixed reviews I find staying there a consistently good experience and prefer it over the other W on Adams I believe and Westins in the area  The front desk staff has always been polite and very service oriented  They always try to upgrade me to a lake view room great view  Room service was tasty but quite slow the last time I stayed there but they comped my meal without my even having to make a comment about it  The rooms arent huge but they are well appointed  As all Ws do they have great Bliss products for the bath  For other business travelers I have never had issues getting online from the rooms which is a bit rare in my experience  I have had FedExes sent to me at the hotel and they are very conscientious about prompt notification of receipt  Note that the HVAC is a bit disruptive as its unit near the window that turns on and off quite abruptly so if that type of thing keeps you up at night you might want to bring earplugs  Further I had Room   the last time and it was right next to a set of elevators so note that you can definitely hear the quotswooshingquot up the updown movement all night long in the rooms that end in  not sure what the room   was next to the other set of elevators  
P => Not as impressive as its name    I stayed here during the ice storm in Chicago this spring  And it was a bit of a disappointment  As someone mentioned it is truly the darkest hotel on the planet  I guess they are trying to add ambience or something  SO DARK however that I had a hard time even locating the elevators  My other guess is be they just dont want everyone to see how dated and worn it all looks  That was my impression  Very drab  Even the sequin signage outside the hotel was in disrepair  The room itself could definitely use some spiffin up  As for the staff   SUPERB They work their tails off to ensure you have a relaxing and wonderful visit  Of course the location and view are to die for   except during an ice storm  But if not for that   it would have been a highlight I am sure  Food is excellent but pricey as one might expect downtown Chicago  Overall I was not impressed enough with the interior to pay the price again  Not even for the view on a clear day  The interior is just too depressing  
P => Not up to W standard If youre looking for an experience along the lines of a W in New York this hotel doesnt deliver it  Definitely visit Bliss Spa here but stay elsewhere I had a king room on the th floor with a city view  It was a wheelchair accessible room lower hanging bar in the closet grab bars in the bathroom   otherwise it was done in the typical W style with darker colors and a rather sleek look  There was a random faux fur cube shaped pillow that was supposed to be a whimsical touch  Overall the room wasnt stunning but it looked fine The bed had a very uncomfortable featherbed on top of it  Usually I love anything that makes a bed more pillowy but this had sharp pointy feathers in it A bigger problem was that the bed smelled terrible  I couldnt tell what it was   the pillows the mattress the featherbed   At one point I saw a guest taking a small dog into the elevator and I realized thats what the bed smelled like   unbathed dog The minibar also had sodas in it with best before dates in   They leave you a little comment card for housekeeping where youre supposed to be able to make small requests so I asked for fresh soda    it never showed up  And I know they had seen the note I left it on the bed and refilled the minibar  Furthermore   no minibar price list  The light in the makeup mirror in the bathroom was burned out so I asked housekeeping to check that too   never got fixed Also its pretty clear that the hotel is trying a bit too hard to seem hip  Heres an example  The hotel information is presented in a weird lucite holder  Its fastened at one corner and you slide pages out  Im sure it was not cheap to produce and its just silly  It doesnt make me think Im in a cool place    it makes me think they dont particularly care for how usable something is as long as it looks funky  I generally enjoy more contemporary hotels and I understand what Starwood is going for with this brand    they just have to deliver style as well as substance a la The Hotel at Mandalay Bay Good points Bliss Spa is excellent  I had a facial and I highly recommend it  The Bliss products in the bathroom are great  Nice high def TV  Location is very convenient to shopping and good restaurants as well as Navy Pier  Getting a taxi was never a problem  
P => Dont waste your money or time I stayed there for one night with my spouse last week thinking itd be the typical W experience trendy  the view of the lake   cant go wrong right I had stayed at many Ws before and this one looks like the rooms were orated with Ikea furniture that was on a blow out sale However my biggest complaint is the level of noise  There was a connecting door between our room and the room next door  No soundproofing whatsoever and of course our neighbors had a party going on  It took forever for the security to resolve the issue and the front desk waited over an hour before they agreed to move us beause they couldnt locate the manager  Unfortunate because or view was breathtaking but if you have to stare at it all night    Long story short terrible experience and I should have listened to others who complained about terribly thin walls  We promptly checked out the next day and moved to the Intercontinental   not much romance but plenty of sleep  
P => Dark  Just Dark  The stay at the hotel was nice Some things I was happy abouta it was clean b Internet link was good with low latency c the staff was courteous d room service food was good Some things I was unhappy abouta this was the quotdarkestquot hotel Ive ever stayed in b some of the staff were dressed and behaved very informally c over the top trendy Despite the clean and courteous atmosphere of the hotel I would never stay at it again  It was very dark in the common areas of the hotel and in the rooms  Everything in my room was very dark and the lighting did not help very much  I got the impression the hotel iswas striving for a trendy image but they over did it to the point is seemed ridiculous  One of the young men that brought me my room service one night had very pale skin wore eyeliner and makeup and looked like a character out of a modern vampire movie  It fit right in with the theme and ambiance of the hotel  
P => Great hotel   but watch those phone calls I recently stayed at the W Chicago for  days on business  I was not surprised by the charges for wireless  or water   I was quite surprised to find that I was charged  for phone calls that I thought I was making on my calling card including  for quotattempted callsquot  When I disputed these charges at the front desk I was told there was nothing they could do and I should quottake it up with accountingquot  I did and have heard nothing in response  So err on the safe side and do not use the phone for anything other than a local call 
P => Hip and Trendy   a treat but not cheap My husband and I stayed in this hotel for one night during our recent trip to the USA  It is a very different style of hotel and although we did like it it certaily wouldnt be everyones taste I would agree with previous reviews who commend the views from this hotel they are incredible and our bedroom also faced onto the lake The trendy furniture and extra little features in the room made it very interesting and the bed was very comfortable  Nice but small pool with an excellent spa facility  A bit of a walk from the centre of town though  Overall a good hip and trendy hotel but quite expensive  
P => Trendy and certainly not cheap We have just spent a week at the W Lakeshore  This is clearly a high quality hotel with a great emphasis on design  The lakeside position is excellent although our room did not face the lake   and it did mean that a walk into town took a good  minutes through some pretty drab back streets  The staff were consistently helpful  I was surprised by the review which says that the hotel is not good for business  When we were there the rooms in the business suite on the th floor were constantly occupied with meetings of one sort or another  A word of warning   the minibar prices were as is often the case astronomical and it was only after a couple of days that we noticed that the bottles of water helpfully placed around the room were costing us  dollars plus tax every time we opened one  More fool us   but what a con 
P => In ten years I  hate it but I love it now The W Lakeshore is definitely not for everyone  Having said that if you do want to wake up to one of the most beautiful views around there is no other hotel you should consider staying in while in Chicago  I have stayed at the W Lakeshore on numerous occasions and inevitably the more memorable stays were the ones in which I didnt come back to the hotel with some work to do  Otherwise walking into a lobby where it seems everyone is intent on partying is pretty disconcerting when you have work to do  For the record I am a W fan  I enjoy the unconventional rooms the plasma TV the assortment of strange stuff for sale W Teddy Bear that they have in their rooms the electronic music in the elevators their trendy bar and their staff   who all seem to be model material  In addition to all that the W Lakeshore has two things that really add to the experience  The view of Lakeshore drive as previously mentioned and their gym filled with every type of equipment and overlooking the lake   you cannot ask for a better workout  One of the things that does take getting used to in Ws all over is the bathroom  The shower in the Lakeshore hotel simply quotdropsquot water  Its not a trickle its a more than ent flow but it doesnt come out with any pressure  Also the bathroom here has a window to the main room which if you have guests in is not really an optimal setting  Beats the W Dallas though which didnt have a door between the bedroom and the bathroom  But thats for another reviewSo be warned   if you ide to stay here youre going to be in a non business hotel in which everyone looks good people are drinking in the lobby the elevators play techno the corridors have purple light and they sell condoms and teddy bears in your room  I look forward to the Ws   its a sea change from the sameness of the riotts Westins and Hiltons and always has you wondering what to expect when you check in  A  rating from me be a  for someone else but that beats a consistent boring  in my book  
P => A Great Hotel This is a great hotel very hip amp fashionable  The service was outstanding  The concierge was excellent  The service is A everytime you walk in this hotel they open the doors for you  Rooms are very cool quot plasma TV Big King beds CDDVD player to watch movies  Radio by bed has a CD player in it  The hotel has a computer room with PCs printer and fax  There is a pool and work out room  Trendy bar  Security is excellent you need a card to work the elevator and at night security guards the elevators only allowing guests through  The hotel overlooks the lake and Navy Pier and is only a few blocks from Michigan Avenue so you are very central Also it is a very gay lesbian bi transgendered friendly hotel  I went with my transgendered girlfriend and no one batted an eyelid  
P => The W Lakeshore is the way to go in Chicago My companion and I stayed at the W Chicago  Lakeshore for  nights in il  for a conference  We had a fantastic time while there  The accomodations were wonderful  our room overlooked Lake Michigan the beach and Navy Pier  I love that the W has a chaise lounge for relaxing in the room and watching the high def LCD tv  The bed is so luxurious and comfortable that I had a hard time waking up to attend my meetings Also while the bathroom is made differently with the shutters neither of us complained about not having enough privacy  In fact I appreciated that I could watch tv while I curled my hair Service was great while I was there  Housekeeping kept the room spotless and supplied plenty of towels  I did not find one member of the staff to be snooty or unhelpful  Yes the staff tends to be on the younger side but they were trained to respond to requests cheerfully and promptly  The only negative I give the hotel is the Wave Restaurant  I tried it on Saturday night and was thoroughly disappointed  No one in their right mind should place a restaurant in the middle of a very popular hotel lobbybar  The dining experience was loud and the food was horrible  The two saving graces were the staff and the infused tinis  Overall the W Lakeshore is a great hotel  However stay away from the Wave  
P => Nice hotel cool lobby This is a typical W hotel which for us made it a LOT of fun  Its got a great hip lobby with lots of stuff going on all the time  They have a good restaurant and it is right within walking distance of lake Michigan and Navy Pier  The Mag  Mile isnt too far several blocks so it is a little trek   but if youre young and dont mind walking a lot then it is doable  The rooms are fantastic  The beds as always are wonderful  The view was good as well  Overall if you can find it at a good deal Id recommend it  It was a little pricy though  
P => Felt like I needed to have a tini in my hand at all times    I stayed at the W Lakeshore for a week on business  The rooms were nicely appointed   the bed and the shower were nice and there was sufficient storage space and hangers for a week  The bathrooms need fans The price for internet access in the room seemed steep   per day however the connection was good and I experienced no disruptions The walls between the rooms are very thin  I could hear my neighbours and the people in the hallway very clearly particularly when they were talking on the phone or using the tv  Inter room soundproofing needs to be addressed The cardio equipment was good but the weight room was mediocre  I went for a run one morning along the waterfront a few steps from the hotel under a tunnel that goes beneath lake shore drive and found that to be heavenly The restaurant Wave had wonderful tapas food and the service was very good  ent wine list but overall the restaurant is pricey  Lunch is also good but on the expensive side The hotel location did seem a little isolated from the main strip on Michigan Avenue as it is a  minute walk along Ontario Street  There is however a very nice brunch place called West Egg Cafe that serves lovely crepes and omlettes at a very reasonable price  There is also a Chipotle and a Starbucks nearby  
P => A good hotel though not for all tastes The W Lakeshore follows the usual formula for W hotels ambient music in the lobby and lifts stylish or in the rooms and a not entirely convincing attempt at a chic designer feel  Overall all this feels like a huge great hotel conglomerate   Westin   trying just a little too hard to be hip  That said as a place to stay its got plenty in its favour  The rooms are comfortable and appealingly non stuffy though Im not sure all the design inations are particularly practical  Theres also a ent fitness centre and pool  The location   next to Lakeshore Drive   isnt especially memorable but its a short walk  minutes or so if youre ambling to North Michigan Avenue  Overall while this is a hotel that probably fails to provide the kind of luxurious boutique style experience that its keting claims it is a perfectly good base to explore Chicago assuming you can get a ent rate  
P => Not worth it Very smoky smelling lobby    minute waits for the elevators   Holier than thou staff oozing fake attitude   I have been either a gold or platinum member of Starwoods for over three years  My wife and I had a one day stay at this hotel   and hated it  The location quoton the lakequot   still involves crossing Lakeshore Drive for access  There are other hotels the Drake that have a Lakeshore address with much more charm This place is a former Holiday Inn   you can certainly tell    
P => I liked it but you might have better options We stayed here for  days while our condo was painted  This is a great location in Chicago though it is a bit isolated from public transportation  The buzz is strong here especially in the summertime with the bar and the sunk  If you plan on spending time shopping on Mich Ave this is okay but if you plan on doing more activities in the city I would try and find another location  For example in the Loop is the City Centre W which I think is a much better property as I do the Seattle W Other than that some minor things bothered me like the shower flooding the entire bathroom floor though that might have been more a function of the long showers than anything else thanks to a great showerhead The design touches are a mishmash the showerhead noted above was great  The rocks in the hallway Not so much  We might have had a BampO stereo which is also great but we could tell some corners were cut in room furniture and furnishings  But then the room had a great deal more personality than most weve been in  
P => Days Inn This was a Days Inn and they spent about  converting it  Its the worst W Ive stayed in  The lobby and bar look reasonably ok but therooms are very poor quality  Seventies stipple paint ceilings with chipboard walls thru which you can hear everything and anything from your neighbours  As others have mentioned there is a bizarre serving hatch kind of thing into the bathroom which means limited privacy  Housekeeping was poor   no one bothered to clean our room at all one day the other days it was tidied as opposed to cleaned  We complained and got a night for free which is ent of them but ultimately the premium youre paying for the W brand is not worht it 
P => W Lakeshore Chicago   great hotel not the best location  Loved the W It is not the best location so you will spend extra on cabs or have to drive to get out  The rooms are a little small but the bar is fun and had fun people at night  Friendly responsive staff  Overall great experience  
P => All vibe and some content When they tell you W Hotels are all trying for a specific vibe   they are   W Lakeshore succeeds in generating and delivering the vibe  It is however sometimes with substance and sometime with none at all  The check in was delightful the elevators hip with Cafe Del  and Hotel Costes tunes the hallways and the lakeview room   socialist  It is not enough to convert an old concrete structure into a hip asipiring hotel   you have to do more Small room paper thin walls had to endure a  minute intermittent alarm my first morning from an adjoining room at am small bathrooms inexplicable lack of privacy with the shutters and a sliding door for the bathroom dust everywhere low ceiling a bit shabby furniture and yes  dollar snacks  For the price   not a bargain     The pool was good  Even though I cannot fathom how you can have a sign by the pool stating that no single person alone can use the pool   so what about the hip single executive wanting to recreate Food at the restaurant   nice Tasty With good service Room service   well   one bathrobe provided when I reserved for  adults towels taken away with no replacements left eerie nd bed turndown after a turndown service was done spooky to have someone in your room so often  Somehow not a value All flash and some substance      Too expensive     not go back since it is not such a great deal     
P => W for whatthe Here for  night stay at the trendy W  I could see the Navy pier attraction from my window but was told by staff that it wasnt safe to walk over there at night via the tunnel  So I was trapped    in a hotel where the registration desk is in the middle of a Eurotrash bar  Loud techno thumps where one is expected to complete transactions  Dont be dressed causally youll certainly feel out of place  Wear earplugs for the rooftop lounge but dont expect a quiet drink anywhere in the hotel  The rooms and halls are cool but I was hoping for comfortable as well  
P => OK Stay at the W I stayed at the W Lakeshore for one night on uary th  I would agree with the previous post that had both pros and cons  The views are indeed fabulous  I loved that I could work out in the healthclub overlooking the lake  The hotel is totally hip and trendy although I will say that I was not overly impressed with the Whiskey Sky bar  I personally like the lobby bar much better  Also the hotel smells fabulous and the location is great  On the downside I thought the walls were a little thin  You could hear everyone open and close their doors all down the hallway  I also didnt really care for the shutter window and shuttered door concept on the bathroom  It leaves much to be desired for privacy  The only other thing worth mentioning which has also been mentioned before is that they do nickel and dime you to death  Im used to mini bar prices being high but  for a small bottle of water is ridiculous  Breakfast for two a la carte in the restaurant  not room service  was  with the tip  I will say though due to the great location there are plenty of nearby dining options outside the hotel that wont break you  Everyone that I dealt with on the staff was great and if I could get a ent rate I would stay at this hotel again  
P => You should try it ONCE and make up your mind Really you should try this hotel once and ide for yourself  This was my third trip with my family and my kids think it is the coolest place on earth the pool with the word quotwetquot at the bottom the fluffy beds and techno beats playing as a backdrop to the whole experience   it is much cooler than well    me  I dont like the dark hallways feel as though they are dark only because the place has something to hide  Frankly it might  The hotel is not new by any stretch of the imagination but it is comfortable  As I checked in this time there was a guy in his late s checking in with a quotgirlquot in her mid s just in front of me  It struck me that if I were to be unried or even having an affair   this would be the hotel where Id want to make it happen The place is full of mojo  The beds are comfy the service is fine and the view from the lakeside is lovely  Try it once  
P => Ridiculously outstanding Was stuck in Chicago for a few days due to a huge storm in Denver   booked my room through Starwood Preferred Guest and from the moment I entered the lobby I knew I was in for an experience  Exceptional customer service by all staff  The small touches are what I noticed at the W     a real person instead of a recording for the wake up call     staff noting their names and indicating that I could call them personally for any needs     an attentive concierge with great suggestions     turndown service on request      Just wonderful  Hip trendy lobby scene   rooftop bar is a little crowded and small but the views from rd floor were likely stunning  Since I was traveling alone I far preferred the quotLiving Roomquot lobby bar  Less clubby  Better people watching  My rd floor lakeview room featured a luxurious shower   a deluge from above A perfect weekend that could have been spent at a regular boring chain turned into an adventure to remember  Absolutely stay at the W Lakeshore  
P => Recommended hotel I just spent a few nights at the W Chicago Lakeshore and enjoyed it  I have stayed at the W in San Francisco so I had an idea of what to expect  The staff was pleasant the room comfortable and the ammenties were nice  At  a night for the regular rate I would choose another hotel in Chicago but it was a steal for what I got on Hotwire  As for the prices they are in line with other four star hotels so I do not understand all the complaining from other postings  I like the roombathroom design and the beds are excellent  The concierge was helpful and pleasant  
P => We love the W and had a great time Me  and my girlfriend  stayed here for  nights with some other friends of us same age and a couple in the mid s and we all liked the hotel Of course the style of the hotel is very hip and modern we love that and thats one of the reasons why we went there The stuff was very friendly rooms are very nice bathroom is very nice and the location is also very nice I was reading some reviews people complaining about the internet and stuff like that   I dont no nothing about it because we were there for a holiday trip  I didnt use the internet  Also some people say in there reviews that there are alot stylish hip young people staying at this hotel  We had a couple travling with us and they are about  years old and they also liked the hotel very much The lobby is nice and also very modern I would defently go there again  
P => Trendy but nothing that impressive We visited the hotel because my husband was there on business  The W definitely lives up to its reputation as a trendy young hotel however the accomodations themselves are not truly comfortable or quotluxuryquot   The lobby also doubles as a barlounge and is full of young hip people almost every night of the week  ITs great to have a place to hang out at your fingertips  The hotel is relatively central and was within walking distance to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave  The rooms however while being cool are very average and really rather small  There is a bathroom with a sliding Japanese style door that works sometimes  The bathroom had only a shower and was tiny  I must say that the bed was very comfortable however the walls are paper thin  We could hear our neighbors every move all night long  Additionally there was no wireless internet which is a huge let down for the business traveler  In summation if we had been visiting Chicago purely to party and have fun the hotel would have been a great choice  Its young fun and a great place to meet people  However we were there on business  Not being able to sleep having small accomodations that dont give you room to work and not being in a business environment is just not conducive to work  Hope this helps you make a great ision  
P => should be  D  for DONT overpriced  it would not be terrible if it werent priced to compete with hotels that quotget itquot but they dont  hallways swarming with cleaning crews who seem to spend most of the morning talking to each other  third try at making a room key worked  worst no wifi in rooms and concierge reported that there are no plans to provide it  s era dsl is available at an exorbitant price of course  this after a phone call BEFORE booking yielded an assurance that there is wifi however even if you ide to travel to the past and use dsl you cant send email using your own mailserver because the amateurs who administer the network have blocked port  in a misguided attempt to thwart spammers add to these problems the crowbar ks on many door jambs and you have a hotel whose time has come and clearly gone  there are hotels where i gladly pay  dollars for croissants  this is not one of them  for one thing the croissants are the size of silver dollars  the staff are very good looking and the views of lake michigan are wonderful  but dont let those details convince you to spend your money here  w has a trendy surface frayed around the edges with nothing underneath and dont drink the voss water until you read the itty bitty price tag  
P => Great people hotel BUT overcharging for basics Another great W Hotel experience  Every staff member we encountered was pleasent  We were a party of  adults and a  year old  The chaise in the king bed room was perfect for the childs bed  We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant and fun drinks in the lounge  Our only complaint was the shocking price of quotthe little stuffquot such as  for our childs apple juice  
P => Beware Bait And Switch Arriving late and exhausted after an epic day of flight delays we arrived at the Ws Lakeshores check in and were told that the room we had booked was no longer available  They gave us  and told us to find taxi to the other W at the Chicago City Center  We had specifically chosen the W Lakeshore for its location its lake views and the pool so shuffling us off to their other hotel which offers none of these perks was outrageous  Beware   you  also be the victim of a bait and switch  The W staff was unapologetic and mainly interested in pushing us out the door  I asked to speak with a hotel manager and was told that he was busy and that someone would call me in the morning  No one did  Ill never book at any W again  We ended up staying at the Park Hyatt  Were given top notch service a great room and when they heard how the W treated us they sent a complimentary bottle of wine and a delicious cheese course to our room  We felt utterly welcomed and relaxed It was a rough night but Im happy I didnt end up staying at the W  It looks really cheesy and cheaply constructed  There were guys wearing big gold chains and sunglasses at night posing and preening with their giant SUVs by the hotel main doors  Once inside expect pounding the music in the lobby area  The W  not guarantee its room reservations but it does offer complimentary blasting music all night long  It was impossible to talk at a regular volume  The front desk attendant basically was shouting at us  If your room is on a lower floor plan on clubbing all night  My  words of advice Stay at Another Hotel 
P => Great time A friend of mine and I ided on a whim that we needed to take a mini vacation and found a comparable rate at the W  The staff was friendly the designs  super hip and the hotel rooms nice and clean  I cant comment enough about what a sweet stay we had  The location of the hotel is just a few blocks from the shopping and restaurants of miracle mile  We took a cab once   and had no problem getting to and from our point of interest  Of the three evenings we were in town we spent one full evening mingling and enjoying the lounge and bar of the hotel  It was def  nice not to have to leave the hotel to have a good time  Overall it was one of the most relaxing stays Ive had at a hotel  I highly recommend this hotel to those looking to have a good time and to be treated kindly  
P => Well be back My husband and I flew up from South Florida to meet my two best friends from NJ there to celebrate my st birthday in Chicago  The weather was suprisingly gorgeous high s low s which made the short walk to Magnificent Mile from the W very pleasurable  The hotel seemed like the place to be  We arrived at midnight on Friday and the lobby was live w what looked like an afterwork crowd at the bar  Everytime you stepped out of the elevator you felt like you were at a party or in the least a lounge  The music was not loud or overbearing as many have posted on this site  It is not a hotel I would recommend bringing your children to and it is best suitable for anyone ranging from   who enjoys the party scene  The rooms were nice beds and linens were very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate and yes the Bliss products were a total plus  The lighting was dim  the type of lighting that makes you look flawless which after a while can get on your nerves but not enough to make me not want to stay here again  Back to the lobby  perfect for casual lounging while taking full advantage of their free wifi and sipping on a cocktail  The barmaids were extremely friendly and come by any part of the lobby you are in to take your order so you dont even have to get up to go to the bar   We found a great restaurant on Rush St called Heaven on Seven Hi Mike which served the best GUMBO weve yet to taste  They have an endless collection of hot sauces w all sorts of crazy names  They also have a great breakfast menu  Sears Tower was totally disappointing and was just a check on our list of things to do in Chicago  However the corner of the Sears Tower was like a ride at Universal Studios  The wind on that corner was something fierce  we couldnt even get the cab door open which was really strange since it wasnt windy anywhere else  The mall at the Water Tower Place was great  Best boot collection Ive ever seen at the Lord amp Taylors there  Best deep dish pizza is hands down  Giordanos  Pizzeria Uno  the original  doesnt carry the same menu as the franchised Unos do and they dont have the happy hour menus either  in my opinion  not worth the visit  We found a cool Irish Sports Bar w great drink specials called Otooles  There is a place called West Egg that seemed like a great breakfast spot  but the wait was  mins so we didnt eat there  The menu looked great tho and the prices were just right  You have to tip the copper cowboy on Magnificent Mile to take his pic but definitely one for the memoir books  We took a  min cab ride to the Funky Buddha Lounge and had a blast  Great place to meet locals who can tell you about other places to check out  Navy Pier was nice  You feel obligated to go since the W is directly across from it but other than the Forest Gump impersonator in front of the Bubba Gump restaurant it wasnt no where near the highlight of my trip  although the ferry ride around Lake Michigan made for great pics  There is a free trolley that travels all around  Ask the concierge for the schedule and it will save you alot of time and cab money  My friends took the train from Midway and said it was really easy to figure out  We took a cab from Ohare and that ran us approx  w tip  Depending on what time of year you go weather permitting theres lots to see and do within walking distance of the W  On our last night there we checked out the Whiskey Bar on the rd floor but it was EXTREMELY dark and SMALL  Smoking is permitted so if you dont smoke its not the place for you since its so small the cigarette smell will linger all over you  Last but definitely not least for me we visitied the Chicago Public Library   Floors A library enthusiasts heaven Overall I loved Chicago  It was exactly how I pictured full of culture and diversity and proud of their locals who flourish in the arts  I cant wait to go back and check out Bucktown and Old Town  
P => Nice stay at the Hip and Trendy W Lakeshore Great hip and trendy hotel  Like the other W hotels the bar Whisky Sky is a big scene  My stay was during the week so it was very quite  I must say I was impressed by the level of service expecting less from some of the reviews  The room was clean amenities include daily newspaper toiletries from their Bliss spa robe hairdryer and comfy bed with down comforter amp pillows  There was a full business center on the th floor equipped with MACs and PCs  A great view of the Lake from the business center  The view from my room was only a city view I guess thats what I get for booking with an online booking agent  Only ran into one snooty concierge but she provide adequate info  Overall a great stay  Next time I will try to get an appointment at the spa 
P => Fine Line There is a fine line between hip and cheesy and the line is drawn right down the middle of this hotel  I felt like I was staying in a Saturday Night Live skit   Night at the Roxbury meets Deiter the uber hip German  They try so hard to be hip but if you have to try it just isnt hip  
P => Very nice We really like this hotel I booked my company to stay here for a tradeshow at McCormick Place  It sounded nice and had a good location  Reading other reviews I was worried it might be too trendy for my group but everyone really liked it from our president to sales manager to sales people  It was in a good location for shopping and restaurants  Rooms were very swanky  It has modern fun or  All employees were very courteous  While I did see some families here I wouldnt bring my kids because I felt is as an adult atmosphere which is fine   we need that sometimes My only complaint would be Id prefer more lighting in the bathroom   but that was no big deal  
P => Uber Trendy Uber Trendy hotel Youll see other reviews that compare it to a set of Sex in the City and theyre correct  However The Ritz this isnt  If you like traditional hotels dont stay here for the following reasons the bathroom lacks privacy because theres a shuttered window in it the rooms are dark with stark lighting the hallways are dark with mood lighting the lobby is party central the lobby and common areas smell like the spa and after awhile its a bit nauseating the hotel shop has overpriced k and little or no sundries no phone books in the rooms and  hours a day theres the boom boom boom of techo music in all of the common areas  The upside Wonderful location comfy beds nice in room flat screen terrific personnel and youll feel like youre cutting edge hip just because youre staying there 
P => Unique experience I found a great internet rate at this hotel for a quick overnight stay in Chicago  It has an idea location within walking distance to Navy Pier and the walk there is beautifulThe room was small but adequate with an interesting or The food in the dining room was pricey and not exactly kid friendly  
P => Enjoyed my stay I stayed at the W Lakeshore recently while supporting my friends who ran the Chicago athon  I did not have to pay for my room as my friend used here Starwood points to book two rooms  Both of our rooms had excellent views one of the lakenavy pier and one of the city  The room was very clean and trendy  The bed was extremely comfortable  The bathroom was very nice  I must admit that the sliding door on the bathroom and shutter window was not my favorite  Not a lot of privacy there  If you are traveling with someone you are comfortable with spouse sibling etc  it would be fine  The lobby area is very active  It does resemble a night club feeling  When we checked in on friday there was a DJ playing in the lobby and a lot of beautiful people around  I thought it was fun and great that you did not have to go far for drinks and people watching in a trendy setting  The staff was excellent and really tried to please our every need  The service was top notch  This hotel is for sure geared towards the younger crowd and we really enjoyed our stay  The location was excellent 
P => Great autumn stay at the W I was in town in mid ober  for a one night stay to celebrate a special occasion and was very happy with my whirlwind stay at the W Lakeshore  Some accumulated SPG Points were used for the Saturday night visit which was booked several months in advance online  As I checked in the friendly desk person one of three on duty to accomodate the afternoon rush not only honored my last minute request for an upper floor room she also also made it one with a lake view    without my asking Sweet  I have to admit since I was using Starwood points rather than actual dollars here I half expected a potentially noisy lower level room with a blah view   Well my shutterbug travel companion and I were both VERY pleasantly surprised to wind up with an even numbered room on the th floor    a quiet corner unit at the end of the hall offering a sprawling and perfect view of Navy Pier and environs Though the guest rooms in this particular hotel are a tad smaller than other the Ws Ive visited a nod to this propertys Days Inn past our king room and compact bathroom were both well designed and tastefully orated  While the rain shower head and over sized plazma TV were both definitely appreciated my fave ammenity was once again the rooms quotHeavenly Bedquot   I slept great   AhhhhhFor those like me who enjoy walking the bustle of Michigan Ave was close at hand   a few blocks to the west of the Ws front door  The neighborhood surrounding the hotel also offers several nearby conveiniences including the Ohio Ave tunnel under Lakeshore Dr which offers quick access to the lakefront running and bike path and beach  Also close by Starbucks White Hen and a nice Italian deli  An Interpark public parking garage is a few doors to the west  too enter off Erie and its rate of day is about   below the Ws valet rate For a hip relaxing scenic and well situated place to stay in the Windy City give the W Lakeshore a try 
P => Way over the top We are four women in our early thirties from both the east coast and the west coast who stayed for a long weekend at the W  This hotel had a good rate on Hotwire and we booked a non smoking room with two double beds The problems began once we arrived  It was difficult to tell even where to check in because there were so many people partying in the lobby you couldnt even see where the check in area wasI know that the hotel cannot always accomodate your preference for smokingnonsmoking but we were assured on the phone that our room would be non smoking because one of us has pretty serious asthma  However we were told that there were no rooms available with the two double bed set up except a smoking room so we had to take it The room is very very dark  Many previous reviews have noted the lack of good lighting and the black ceilings dont help either  The air conditioning unit is very loud and we had to keep it on because of the smell of smoke in the room  The bathrooms are really lacking in privacy since the quotshuttersquot and door are both hollow  The shower however was very nice but there was not a fan in the bathroom to clear out the steam  We also had a problem with customer service  No one could get a train schedule for us so we could figure out what time to take the blue line back to the airport and we asked for a wake up call for AM but got two calls one at  and one at   I would like to note that we were able to change rooms the last night of our stay a Sunday night to a non smoking room but we needed to make a fuss at the front desk in order to do so we knew that many guests had left the hotel that morning  We did like the location of the hotel and were able to walk many places  However given the above problems we would not stay there again  
P => Not a place for a business visitor  Stayed for  nights for a trade fare at Navy Pier  Location was great for walking to Navy Pier but if you are going to hop in a cab to get there becfuase of the one way system you end up going a couple of blocks in the oppoite direction which means it probably costs and takes the same time to get there as hotels a bit further away  And although it is across the road from the Lake it is one big busy ugly road  The hotel itself is more like a night club than a hotel and was the opposite of a tranquil escape after a hard days work  And as for a singles scene when i was there it was full of convention type people not beautiful young people   not the sort of vibe I was expecting Room itself was nice but I would defo not stay here again  
P => Not worth it The room was upscale the facilities upscale but the hotel was populatednot so much by guests but rather by roving patrons of the lobby and upstairs bars  The scene is very hot in the bars but the hotel needs to keep non guests off the other floors During the day the place is calm but after work and at night it is a party place for the singles scene  
P => W stands for Worst Service Ever A group of us stayed at the W lakeshore for a weekend for my sisters bachelorette party  We chose the package deal which was supposed to include a luxury suite for the bride and  friends limo transportation to and from the clubs and special VIP treatement at Le Passage  Instead we got a suite with one king bed for  people a BUS and the bouncers at Le Passage acted as though they had no idea what we were talking about  So obviously Id never recommend the bachelorette package  In addition checking in took forever the staff was unfriendly and rude and the hotel or is overrated  The only thing we liked about our stay were the Bliss products in the bathroom 
P =>   not for this pricehotel level Chicago is my hometown which is why I never used to know much about Chicago hotel rooms  However now that Im in DC I travel as often as I can to Chicago and get to choose hotels  My favorite remains Sofitel designamenities and Sutton Place locationamenities  I love to travel and typically go at least  if not  star hotels  I took my boyfriend to the W because well its the W and the W in NYC is pretty nice  I do not recall the last time I left a hotel but we left W  OK here is my reviewFor a long weekend we were booked in their spectacular room overlooking navy pierlake  GORGEOUS VIEW and if youre into that this is the place for you wan to stay  While the room looked very pretty it was NOT CLEAN  The rug needed a vacum and the duvet cover was dusty on top  While the bathroom was designed to look ultra chic HORRIBLE LIGHTING  girls never have I experienced such bad lighting in a small bathroom anywhere I dont know how they managed to get it so poor but I was afraid to put makeup on not knowing what Id look like  Also the shower had no door and is a stand up only  Note it has no door and the water just runs into the entire bathroom  ridiculous design  The shades on the room were exceptionally difficult to pull down to cover the brilliant sun which comes in with the great view at like am  BOTTOM LINE beautiful design requires some quality and thoughtfulness to make it practical  SERVICEWISE I ordered some hot water after a late night out with friends at about  on a thursday night  I had to call x in order to get a cup of hot water delivered almost a full hour later Suffice it to say my boyfriend and I cked into Sutton Place as early as friday  I will say that he and other friends of mine particularly enjoyed their spa Bliss though I cant comment on that  Also admittedly their feather bed and sheets were ultra comfy  As a Chicago local I would also add that W lakeshore is not the best location for your visit  OK for navy pier but itll be a short cab ride to MI ave shoppingrush st food  If you want to see and do more better stay somewhere else  
P => The Perfect Stay I booked a stay at the W Lakeshore for my husbands th birthday  We both live in Orlando and hes a huge Cubs fan so I planned the trip around going to a game at Wrigley Field  While I expected a lot from the W they really blew both my husband and I away  Everyone from the valet to the concierge to the front desk to the restaurantbar staff to the Bliss Spa staff were top notch  Everyone always had a smile and kind word and were willing to do quotWhateverWheneverquot  I had emailed that GM prior to arrival to let her know about my husbands birthday and they were kind enough to have fresh fruit full size Bliss Spa products and a Cubs hat in our room when we checked in  The hotel is very quothipquot  The lobbybar area has great or great lighting and smooth House music playing  During the evening theres usually a pretty good size gathering hanging out and socializing  The restaurant Wave has great food and has a very unique feel  My husband said he felt like it should be in a movie  Theres also a small but very nice bar on the rd floor called Whisky Sky where we spent a couple of evenings and watched the fireworks go off at Navy Pier  The rooms themselves are a little small and dark but still very nice with the whole modern feel  The bedding is awesome and there are big LCD TVs to watch if you ide to stay in  The bathrooms are nice and the shower had this half glass door thing which causes the floor gets a little wet but nothing too bad If you have time theres a Bliss Spa on the th floor  We had an awesome experience there with facials and massages and of course great service  All and all I highly recommend this property especially if looking for something modern stylish and young feeling  The service and atmosphere are great  The W played a huge part in making the trip special  We really look forward to going back  
P => This Hotel Rocks The lobby is like a tastefully done club lounge complete with DJs spinning both weekends nights we were there  Adds a touch of party time to your trip  The rooms are well done nice toiletries firm bed quot plasma TV  The rainshower head is nice and if you can score a lake view its about the best overall hotel room feel in the city  Be ready to spend some cash   The valet is pricey  nt bottled water is   and the location a few blocks off Michigan requires you to take cabs but you get what you pay for with this hotel  Were definitely staying here next trip   its worth it  
P => Trying too hard I am the ideal candidate for the W hotel  Late  s a design enthusiast avid traveler etc That being said I did recognize the quality of the design and materials used at the  W  Its look is first class which is what I expected from the hotel My only complaint as for the look of the hotel is that the hallways where very dark giving it a night club atmosphere  This is O K  at night but when you return from the Gym at AM it s nice to see some light  The reason that I would not return to this hotel is the people other guests  It really seems that everyone is trying so hard to impress wearing there seven jeans and energie shirts  It gives the feel of a fake  look at me attitude  I was there over a long weekend and it seems that half the people there can t afford it but they scrounge the money together to be seen at the  W   Many people will enjoy this hotel great location resourceful concierge nice rooms with plasma TV s and bliss care products etc   I also think some people will relate to my comments and stay away  Being at a night club for    straight days is kind of insane  
P => Loved the place I absolutely loved this place  When you walk into the lobby you feel as though youve walked into something straight off of Sex and the City  The or is very trendy and eclectic  The bed in the room was so comfortable that I couldve spent my entire time lying in it  I loved the oversized brown suede chaise lounge that was in the room  The room had a flat screen television with beautiful furniture  I love the outdoor seating area where you could sit and take on the lake breeze which happens to be right across the street  The hotel is walking distance of Navy Pier The lobby is turned into a quotnight clubquot after hours so if peace and tranquility is your objective then that wont be achieved here  It was a plus for me because we were able to party right in the lobby and stumble up to our room right after  This hotel is for people who are full of life and energy    Not the stuffy pretentious types The staff were very accomodating and seemed genuinely friendly  Although I didnt get the opportunity to visit the spa pool or many of the hotels amenities what I did experience I loved  
P => Bad bones   Ok skin     My partner and I love a modern chic hotel  This is why I am a big fan of the W brand  However I also like new which the W Lakeshore is not  At first glance the property looked amazing but as you looked closer you could tell it was an old hotel that had a lot of issues covered up by dim lighting and modern fixtures The Bliss spa was awesome  One of the best spa facilities Ive been to and very reasonably priced On weeknd nights the the lobby turns into a hip hop lounge with hundreds of people  We had to wait in line to simply get through the front door of our hotel  It seemed to be a very rough crowd  The concierge said they planned on getting a different DJ to try to distract the current crowd from coming to the W Overall it is a great location  Helpful staff and you can definitely get good rates  However if you are hoping for something new and modern this place misses out on the new  
P => Interesting but dont look too hard for quality  Having stayed at W Hotels in Sydney now called Blue Los Angeles and New York I was looking forward to my  nights at the Chicago version  Based on the previous stays this one simply fails to meet the standard  Staff are eager to please but the place itself is a let down  Room or was trendy  years ago about the same time as the noisy air con units were last serviced I think  Rooms are small poorly maintained eg wet stain on carpet on arrival and generally quottiredquot So is the hotel chic Hardly  Chic is more than or it is the guests as well  Sharing a lift with a drunken guy in cut off jeans be considered chic in Chicago I have no idea but not my idea at all  
P => Will Only Stay   W From Now ON This hotel totally rocked and was possibly one of the BEST hotels I have every stayed in Mind you I am in their target demographic of mid s to early s  If you were my parents you would probably be annoyed What We Liked The Hilarious Nightclub Feel Yes those are club beats pumping in the lobby elevator swimming pool and gym  Is it completely necessary No  But would you get this in any other hotel Probably not  It was just fun to roll with and lh  Us Vertigo blaring in the lobby was also a cool touch  The Ultra NEW Gym   Yes there are TV screens built into your elliptical and treadmill that overlooks the lake on the th floor  Chilled towels apples and a large flat screen TV were also great The Rooms   Bliss Spa Products worth  alone stocked into your bathroom everyday  Clear glass enclosed shower and a large LG flat widescreen TV in our room  Comfy bed and chaise Free Cookies amp Juice in the lobbyWhat We Disliked Loud Old Air Conditioning Unit   Would literally wake you up sometimes and overpower the volume of the TV  The Day Valet Parking   Skip this part and park at the hotel next door enter off Erie St  at the Standard Parking Lot for Day  Leave your car and walk only  blocks to Mag Mile Enjoy Your Trip 
P => Love this Atomsphere I am Starwood Gold member and used my star points for a weekend getaway at the W I arrived at am and the front desk was able to get me a room immediately  I had problem with my television upon entering my room the front desk sent someone up within ten minutes to repair it  the problem happend again after the maintenance repair man left the next time the front desk sent two gentlemen up and they replaced my television with and brand new one and gave me a free in room movie  Not only were the two gentlemen courteous but they also talked to my friend on the telephone and gave him directions to the hotel that would help him avoid rush hour traffic  I loved the lunch menu at Wave the food was wonderful as was my server who treated me like I was his only customer  I loved the DJ in the lobby  The workout room was great it was wonderful to do cardio with a view of Lake Michigan  The room was wonderful  the bed made you not want to get out of it the showerhead in the bathroom was great and the soaps and lotions from Bliss spa were great  The Bliss spa was great the staff was wonderful and the snacks in the waiting room were delicious  I will definitely stay here again  
P => Mixed Results As a Starwood Platinum member I was excited to use points to stay for the y th weekend  Unfortunately the weekend ended up being a mixed bag due to some unexpected items see below  My wife  month old son and I spent four nights in a King room on the th floor with a lake view  Below is a sumy of our experienceGreat  Amazing view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  Easy access to the path along Lakeshore Drive and to Navy Pier  Comfortable beds the standard Starwood quotheavenlyquot bed  Nice soapsamenities Bliss spa soaps and gelsOkay  Hotel is right on Lakeshore Drive but is a bit of a hike to Michigan Avenue and the nearest train stop  Housekeeping was adequate   on one day they hadnt made up our room as late as pm Not Good  The hotel trys too hard in the quotchicquot category  The hallways and rooms are much too dark   after spending a bit of time in the room we felt claustophobic due the color schema   Way too many drunks during the evening   the hotel is integrated with a bar on the nd floor which means youre riding up and down with all the party goers each evening  Not cool when youre traveling with a toddler   The elevators are extremely slow  There are four total which are shared with the staff and club goers  This ended up being a big pain everytime we came and went from the hotel In sumy if youre a twenty something single who likes to party this is your place  Although I will note that the quotW lookquot is beginning to look a bit worn and tired I question how much longer theyll be able to stay hip  Personally the next time we use points in Chicago well stay at either the Westin on Michigan Ave  or the one in River North  
P => What Wonderful Service    We Cant Say Enough     From some of the comments that we read on this website about this being a hotel for the younger business types and the hotel itself being of a contemporary nature and style my husband and I both were kind of apprehensive about staying here at the W Lakeshore since we are both in our s  But we wanted to stay at a hotel right on the shore of Lake Michigan for our vacation that could provide us with a good view and the W seemed to be the only one located right on the Lake  Well my husband and I have just returned home after a  night stay at the W Hotel Chicago Lakeshore and I felt compelled to come back to Tripadvisor to post our comments about this hotel and their extraordinary service  First of all I must say that we were both completely overwhelmed by the excellent service there  We have stayed in a variety of hotels over the years and have NEVER experienced any stay at a hotel like we have just experienced staying at this W  From the moment that we checked in on Friday  with their courteous quick and helpful staff to leaving today  we cant express enough positive comments about their wonderful service and first rate friendly staff  Each and every one of the staff members who we encountered just seemed to bend over backwards and go out of their way to comply with our requests  Our every need was met in a timely manner and well above any of our expectations not to mention their extreme friendliness and very sincere concern that we were satisfied while staying there  The room met all of our needs with all the amenities that we could possibly ask for and provided us with an extremely overwhelming view of Lake Michigan the Navy Pier and even fireworks  It was also kept very clean and tidy by the housekeeping staff providing fresh towels and linens every day We both were extremely impressed by the W Hotel Lakeshore and the hotel staff and if we ever get the chance to come back to Chicago the W Lakeshore is definitely where we will stay  
P => Hip Fun Hotel What a refreshing change from riotts Hyatts Hiltons etc  This hotel is definitely for young professionals   but I enjoyed none the less  Wonderful room wonderful bed so nice to have a quotsnackquot box without that irritating alarm system that charges you if you remove item longer than  seconds Loved the Bliss products  Hotel was very dark intriguing loud but not unbearable loud dance music lots of young folks in lobbybar area and definitely not your typical elevator music The public bathrooms are a hoot rocks in the sinks beaded entries dark  The hallways are dark with red lights lined with troughs of rocks and room numbers are large red numbers at your door stitched into the carpet   yes it is that dark  They use cute names for things i e  the gym is called quotsweatquot and the pool is called quotwetquot  They love candles in that hotel and the staff is young hip GQ looking but nice  that is why a copy of Rolling Stone Magazine was in my room I was there for a conference for  days  nights and stayed in my room in that wonderful bed glass of wine good book instead of wandering outside  
P => Amazing Hotel Stars The W hotel is the most modern and unique hotel i have ever been too  everything was extremely modern and up to date  when you first walk into the reception there is a lively atmosphere and the staff extremely helpful  the rooms were very nice and funky i would recommend this hotel to under s as i feel it was be a little too modern for the older residents  there is a night club on the  floor  i loved the design of this hotel and the whole modern style  would deffinately stay here again and at any other W hotelan amazing experience       
P => A fun change Stayed at the W for a night and loved it  Yes its a little too quothipquot I felt like the room was saying quotyoure wearing THATquot to me but found the or interesting  I loved the glass walled shower and gray slate in my bathroom the open window between my bedroom and bathroom the Bliss soaps and conditioners   finally a hotel that gets that women dont use soap on their faces There are little wear and tear signs   chips in the black furniture finishes etc    but the bed was heavenly and the plasma TV and soft music from the CD player were wonderful  My discounted room faced the city and I left the blinds open at night to see the city lights  Staff were unfailingly pleasant and helpful  Got into my room early   I arrived at  in the afternoon   which was wonderful In short I was wishing my husband could be there to share the fun 
P => W for Wow This is a funky cool hotel  Nice gym great room service great staff  Be careful of parking though  Its a whopping  bucks a night to park your vehicle Still a great hotel  
P => Great Attitude too funky for me I recently stayed for a business conference at the W hotel on Lake Shore Dr in Chicago  The only good thing I could say about it was that the staff had a nice attitude  HOWEVER the hotel itself was converted from a Ramada and it was dark and attempting to be quotchicquot   While I do not consider myself chic I know it when I see it and this place was trying WAY TOO hard  The bathrooms in the lobby were almost unisex in that one could see through an opaque wall into the other sex sink area  A sign on the male portion read quotWave Wink and meet her outsidequot or something to that effect  Just stupid The room was small  It was very tight from the end of the bed to the bureau and the paint was already starting to chip  I stayed on the nd floor  I will never understand how hotels have not moved to energy saving flourescent bulbs in rooms   what a waste  I resented the litterally everything in the room seemed to be for sale  Not only was there VOSS Sparkling water with no lable on it saying that it was   a pop but there were also price lists once I found them for a stuffed bear a W baseball cap etc  Tacky not chic My most important criticism was that the fee for internet service was   per day until NOON the next day  Upon checkin the front desk told me it was simply  hours they should know how it is done  Hotels have to get with the program and stop charging extra for this amenity  This is rediculous for a hotel that calls itself quotbusiness classquot   I resent this a great deal Finally check your bill  I stayed on the quotCity Sidequot of the hotel and was able to hook into the many open wireless connections across the street so I never used the hotels expensive internet connection  My bill stated that I had  The front desk took it off the bill but I am angry that they thought I had connected  I NEVER even plugged it in  
P => Nice Hotel Stayed here mid   on business  My room was nice and large on the upper floors  Comfortable beds  Quick friendly service great location across from the lake  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Enjoyed my stay at the W Have to admit I was apprehensive about staying at the W having read some of the reviews here  Fortunately I wasnt disappointed The W is very different from the usual hotels in terms of concept amp or  very Zen like with lighting in their rooms amp lobby that sets the mood amp reflects their vision of the warmth of cool  I loved it Had a city view room on the st floor   thoroughly enjoyed the room amenities their signature bed pillows were abit too soft for my liking though chaise lounge armoire  plasma colour tv cotton robe amp Bliss products in the bathroom  The bathroom was abit on the small side with just a shower no tub     but I liked the open concept and wooden window shutters amp sliding wooden door gave it a resort like feel  The closet for hanging clothes just had a cloth curtain no doors  it was interesting  The CD player with soothing music playing was a very pleasant welcome into the room after having endured a  hour flight into the States I didnt spend alot of time at the hotel though only stayed  nights  during the day was out amp about the Magnificent Mile and attending a day conference at the Westin Chicago River North  The hotels convenient location is one of their plus points  Am considering looking out for other Ws the next time I travel     its a refreshing change 
P => Loved the W Chicago Lakeshore We stayed at the W Chicago Lakeshore the weekend of      We enjoyed our visit very much  The hotel is very nice clean and well located  Staff was courteous and efficient  Our room had a wonderful view of the lake  It was clean and very comfortable albeit a little small  The hotel is very close to Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier as well as to many good restaurants  The overall atmosphere is trendy and vital  All in all we highly recommend this hotel  
P => Whatever      Whenever The quotWquot spends more time thinking about cutesy ways to incorporate Ws into the things at the hotel instead of a few other letters As the   of  hotels there is obviously need for a great deal of improvement and my recent  day stay there is a good indicator that this turnaround should not be expected anytime soon  It is entirely possible probable and rightfully should drop into the triple digits among preferred hotels in the Chicago area Dining at WAVE is uninspired pedestrian and perhaps capable of enticing the palate of someone that has eaten at a mediocre hors douveres buffet  Over priced over hyped quotgrazingquot The noise off Lakeshore Drive can be abated by cranking up the noisy air conditioning units in the rooms The quotWquot has a quotWhateverWheneverquot policy that is meaninglessI only requested two things while staying here     Larger slippers for use with the robe  The ones in the room were obviously not designed for a size  Male  Never delivered never explained so I kept my socks on while walking around in the room   Expecting an important fax I called the quotOquot and asked to have it dispatched to my room immediately upon receipt   minutes later I called again and was told it hadnt arrived   minutes later I called again was told it would be checked into and a reply would be forthcoming  Ten minutes later I got dressed went down to the front desk inquired about the fax and quotmagicallyquot it had quotjustquot arrived  Absolute Lies  The time stamp on the top of the fax showed it was received by the hotels machine an hour and  minutes earlier and  minutes after my first call Two items Two failures   AdiosDont waste your time at this place    move further up the list  Im Starwood Platinum and wont stay here again nor will I stay at any quotWquot hotel in the future based on this experience  
P => A good nights stay at the W We stayed at the W Hotel Lakeshore on Saturday il    We bid the room on Priceline and got a very good rate  We had a room with a city view king sized bed  Nice room comfortable bed  Soft sheets and pillowcases The shower has one of those half doors that seem to be coming more prevalent  It has a rainshower head which was okay Room was clean and quiet  Didnt know what to expect on a Saturday night Would stay there again  
P => Excellent Place To Chill In Chicago  Just returned from  fabulous nights staying at the W Hotel Lakeshore Chicago Hotel enjoys an excellent location right on Lakeshore drive with magnificent view across Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  The Magnificent mile with all it has to offer is only a short  minute stroll away We stayed in a Lake View room which contained a very large and comfortable bedfunky Chez Lounge quot Plasma TV mini bar and lots of other useful goodies including an iron amp board and lots of Bliss Spa products Rooms are not massive but are ample for a couple and their baggage  The bathroom was funky with a sliding door slatted shuttered window and large walk in shower Staff were helpful and friendly  We really enjoyed the hotel restaurant quot Wave quot  We had booked it to eat on our first night however it was so good we went again  Other great spots to eat close by are Mortons Steakhouse Ginos East Pizza West Egg Breakfast and Coco Pazzo Cafe for Italian  These were all within walking distance The hotel has an excellent vibrant atmosphere and we would definitely stay againOne watch out             they do plan to do some building improvements during  so probably worth an quick e mail to the hotel to check when 
P => Fun in the City Just returned from the W Lakeshore  This is a fun hotel and the staff really seems to want the guest to enjoy their stay  BLISS spa lives up to its name dont miss it  The gym was great including fresh oranges and plenty of towels  Now this hotel is a little loud when it is full  We spent  nights  were very quiet and  were a bit louder  The hotel did a great job turning an ordinary hotel into something with a unique or and a fun look  Id recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something fun and unusual in Chicago  Location was pretty good very close to the Navy Pier and about     blocks from Michigan Ave  Taxis are easy to get if you need them  Rooms service was prompt housekeeping was very good  
P => Fab Hotel Myself amp my husband were very impressed with the W Lakeshore  The rooms were fantastic flat screen TV large rooms extremely clean amp well kept  The Whiskey Sky Bar was great with brill views of Navy Pier  Wave Restaurant devine food fabulous  WhateverWhenever service great if you need a little help with chargers etc  you just press a button  close to everything  Staff friendly  Bliss Therapy rooms a must the massages are great  They even supply the lemon amp sage body butter and shampoos etc in the rooms Loved every minute of it brill  
P => Hit or Miss at the W Lakeshore Ive stayed at this hotel  times over the last  years  At first glance it appears to be quite a chic place with a definite euro urban vibe  The lobby seems like a posh lounge which  not appeal to some like my parents for instance The rooms are both good and bad  The beds are very nice with high TC sheets and duvets and lots of pillows  The bathrooms are hit or miss with common plumbing issues causing the open concept shower to flood the entire bathroom floor  My latest complaint is the skimping of amenity items  Previously the hotel offered Aveda products then they switched to Bliss  Great stuff On my latest trip I left my body moisturizer and conditioner at home bc I expected to find these on my little shelf in the bathroom  I was very disappointed to find only a shampoo soap and shower gel waiting for me upon check in  My hair and skin are quite parched as a result Overall it is a ent hotel if you can find a deal  Beware parking is night for valet which is higher than most downtown hotels  
P => OK expected more Stayed here on a Saturday night used SPG points  Price would have been  for the night  I agree with previous posters that mention Hip Chic Zen etc  They try for it no question  Here is what my wife amp I think  The location is great on the Lake near Navy pier a short walk from Michigan amp Rush St  The staff was very friendly and helpful  I found the room and the hotel to be unique but tired  Lots of low lights and I think I see why it helps to hide the faults  We were on the nd floor with a City View  The bed was comfortable and big but AC was one of those individual ones you see in a Ramada and it was loud  We could hear the people in the room next to us when they used the bathroom showering while we got ready to go out  A look behind the mirror showed that there was an opening with wallpaper over it  be I expected this Hotel to be on the same scale as the last hotel we stay in quotTHE Hotel at Mandalay Bayquot in Vegas  Its not close  I give it a   out of  stars  I expected more out of Starwoods top of the line hotel especially for  starwood points  
P => So sheek Just thought I would write a quick review of a great place  When we pulled up to the valet we got out of the car to hear some great club music  The W on the wall was all lit up in glitzy lights  It made you feel like you were stepping into an LA night club  The lobby was full of young gorgeous people and again that great music was going  You felt like you were in this great trendy place  It was such a nice surprise  The room was incredibly clean  The or was trendy modern straight clean lines  Very Zen  The colors were amazing  In our standard room the details were a plenty  Everything looked like it had taken so much time to design  Each room has its own flair instead of your plain room  So colorful and cozy  The bathroom was so beautiful  The shower had a solid glass door  The bathroom had a shutter that opened to look into the main room  The bed was huge with nice a nice fluffy down comforter  The pillows were feather tick and so soft  We got room service and it was delicious  We went upstairs to the bar on the top floor  That was a great place with great drinks and more beautiful people  The view was so incredible  It was great to sit in this flashy bar with great couches and look over the city and the lake  We had a great time and I would recommend this hotel to anyone of any age that wants to feel like a star for a day  right in Chicago  
P => Never again Just stayed at the W Lakeshore  If youre looking for a hotel room that is dark and dreary this is the place for you  If you like having privacy in your bathroom meaning an actual door and no shutters this is the place for you  I was very disappointed in the quality of the room and I will never ever use Hotwire again  
P => Much better than expected After reading some of these reviews I must admit I was a little hesitant about the W Lakeshore  I was pleasantly surprised  It seems that most of the complaints dealt with noise small rooms or that rooms were rundowndirty  My experience was the opposite of all of the above  First of all once in the rooms the noise of the lobby the hallway the elevators or from nearby rooms was gone  Regarding the size of the rooms I thought my room was good enough   with a king size bed chase lounge and desk  And finally there was nothing in the hotel or our room that seemed dirty in any respect My overall impression of the W Lakeshore was trendy modern and incredibly comfortable  I loved the touch of the W CD playing in the room as we arrived as well  Without a doubt I will stay here again and stay at any other W  This was my first W experience and I look forward to the next  As some other reviews have said if you are in to the traditional standard and somewhat boring hotel this is not the place for you  
P => Outstanding Service The W Hotel Lakeshore is a wonderful place to stay  My husband and I were in Chicago for two days  We arrived early in the morning  The room was of course not available at am so it was suggested if I had the time to visit the Bliss spa  Bliss is just that quotPure Blissquot the staff was attentive the prices extremely reasonable  Now for the hotel itself   any W Hotel is trendy with a modern sleek feel  The front desk staff was amazing   they bust serious butt to make you happy and comfortable   I cannot say enought about them  I went for my spa treatments finished at am and they had my room clean and ready to go   long before the official check in time  I was also given a late checkout due to my husband s schedule  I know in some instances when a hotel is fully booked to the max   this is not possible   they were near capacity and still accommodated me  We are both in our  s and loved this place  The rooms were not noisy in fact they were quiet   one of the more quiet hotel rooms we had ever stayed in  Our room faced the city not the bay but the city view at night was lovely  The beds were divine so comfortable  The Wave restaurant served as my lunch spot the restaurant staff was attentive and helpful  The lunch menu was tapas style  The food was wonderful and light and well worth the price which was very reasonable  The location is also good   with easy access to the  Magnificent Mile  and the Institute of Art  This hotel is trendy and rather modern chic   it  not be for everyone  Yes some updates could be done in the hallways leading to the rooms but the lobby is very nice as are the rooms  Every staff member I encountered at the hotel was fabulous and helpful  If you like a more traditional hotel basic and blah   this place is not for you  If you enjoy a funky flair and amazing hotel staff persons   this place is for you  
P => Trendy But Seriously Flawed W Chicago is a trendy upscale refurb of a formerly discount type hotel on Chicagos lakefront  Our stay was a big disappointment  Our non smoking room was seriously smokey  The space was tiny  The room was noisy  We could even hear guests next door talking at normal conversational levels as well as the elevators going up and down all night The lighting and atmosphere in the hotel is creepy  even sort of tawdry  Of greatest concern was that everything just seemed dirty worn and unkept  Parking is an outrageous  per night  This is a hotel trying so hard to be hip that its forgotten the basics On the positive side the staff was accomodating  The bed was nice and the LCD TV was great  Room service food was quite good You can do much much better at other downtown hotels especially at these prices  We cannot recommend the W  
P => modern luxury at the W My husband and I stayed at the W for  nights in early t of  and I have been meaning to write a review for it since that time  The exterior of this hotel leaves much to be wished for but inside it is sleek and seductive  This hotel is a refurb so the hallways can seem a bit drab and dark but other than that everything else is gorgeous  The room we had with a lakefront view was zen inspired and the feel of modern luxury was everywhere  We enjoyed delicious though pricey  hour room service the french toast and fresh squeezed orange juice out of this world round the clock and requested CDs from their music library which they happily brought up to us within minutes  The pool was often filled with rowdy children but the sun k was relaxing with a wonderful view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  The Whiskey Sky bar was dark and intimate with an edgy feel just perfect for a scotch on the rocks and a view of the city  The staff was helpful and prompt and overall I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend it to friends  
P => our wedding here was perfect OKAY first of all I am writing this three and a half years after my wedding and weekend stay at the lovely W Lakeshore only because I saw some negative reviews and I want to set the record straight  First of all this hotel is beautiful and yes it has a bit of a hip quotclub vibequot but thats what W Hotels are known for  if you dont like that whole scene then you are better off staying somewhere else perhaps on Michigan Avenue  My husband and I are honored that we were the first wedding booked at the W Lake Shore back in ust   Our room was ultra fancy and quiet which is exactly what we needed after having our reception  Not to mention this hotel has some of the best views in the city It couldnt have been more perfect and romantic  This place will always be special to me    
P => No complaints My husband and I had our wedding reception at the W Chicago City Center and ided to celebrate our  yr  anniversary at the W Chicago Lakeshore  While City Center is more a business hotel Lakeshore attracts the partyers  Its likely the hotel will be active elevators zooming guests in the hallways doors closing into the wee hours  The basic rooms are small and dark but comfortable  Service was willing and friendly accomodating everything we asked for  The lobby lounge is lively until closing with great people watching  And the Bliss spa on the hotels th floor is worth a trip    friendly and unpretentious with  heavenly  services  Overall wed visit again without question  But a quieter option  be City Center  Its slightly farther away from the action but nothing a quick cab ride cant fix  
P => Mediocre experience could have been worse I stayed at the W Chicago Lakeshore with my wife for a surprise weekend on her birthday  We stayed in an urban suite on the th floor with a fantastic lake view  This is probably the most redeeming feature of this hotel  The or was typical W but far more worn around the edges than any other W I have stayed in New York Times Square New York Court Montreal  The suite itself was just two small rooms patched together  If I had had a basic room Id probably have an entirely different reaction to the hotel  The corners were dusty and one of the doors arating the bedroom and living room had been knocked off its hinges  The bedspread had seen better days and the towels were downright ratty  Toiletries Bliss were great as always  No turndown service  The promised Sirius satellite radio did not work and the maintenance man when called failed to fix it and threw in the towel  The location is alright but since it was our first time in Chicago I regretted not staying on North Michigan Avenue especially considering that for the price of an urban suite we could have had a room at the Park Hyatt where a room is actually bigger than the Ws quotSuite quot Tiny bathtub shower ran hot and cold all generally signs that the physical plant needs some tuning On the other hand the breakfast at Wave was fantastic and were pretty picky  Try the French Toast Sundae or one of the smoothies  The Bliss Spa looked great but my wife said that the treatments themselves were pretty weak  Nice touches like wine and cheese but very expensive for poor treatments and a nice facility  All in all the weakest of the  Ws I have stayed at but W still creates an atmosphere very successfully  In New York I cant speak highly enough about the W Court which was fantastic but the Chicago Lakeshore just showed too many signs of its former incarnation as a Days Inn  Id say shop around and consider only if the rate is a steal  Warning standard rooms are tiny  
P => Mediocre Hotel I give this hotel a nuetral rating due to it being a  star hotel  It is a great location as far as being right on Lake Shore Drive and a short  block walk to Michigan Avenue  It was very easy to find by car and we arrived to find the front of the hotel and the previous block under some kind of construction which took away from my first impression  We were able to check in early which was nice though and the staff was very helpful getting us and all our gear out of the car as we were traveling with our  year old dhter  The reception to the hotel is all tile LCD screens recessed lighting etc The elevators smelled like lemongrass which makes you want to rush to the newly incorporated Bliss spa for some pampering but also made think it might be to mask some kind of elevator odor as the bulding seemed quite old despite the mod finish  The hallways are dark with red recessed lighting and smooth riverstones in a trough running down both sides of the hallway  The room is very modern and nicely orated and the king size bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows  The requested crib was your basic crib and matress which was a dissapointment after experiencing the heavenly crib that is available in most Westins  The room was dissapontingly small especially when you have a crib in the room but the view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier especially at night with the lit ferris wheel made up for it  The bathroom is all Bliss products and the shower is one of the glass with no door rain shower type of things This hotel really does not cater to kids  Here is the list of cons on that aspect  Small room means lots of bumps and bruises  Mirror leaning against the wall looks great but is hard to keep a kid from crawling behind   All the nice knick knacks they put out rocks glass with twigs inside etc  were quickly cleared away which took away from the quotexperiencequot of the chick or   No bathtub   Room service meal from kids menu spaghetti mixed veggies miscellaneous tipsdelivery charges and milk cost a staggering   We did use the hotels preferred babysitting service which was expensive but VERY good and worth the money for the peace of mind Overall it is a nice hotel and not bad for the money  Well probably try the Westin on Michigan avenue next time  
P => Whatever Whenever   whenever they get to it My boyfriend and I are loyal to the Starwoods brand and have rarely been disappointed by the Westin hotels  Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the W hotels  We have tried  W hotels around the US the latest the W Lakeshore and have had disappointing experiences at each  The or at this hotel is funky and fun  However the furniture and carpeting is dirty and old  The elevators smelled of vomit and we found a disgusting stain in our room  The only saving grace is the lack of lighting that distracts you from the grime  The rooms themselves are loud  We stayed on the nd floor but could hear construction and traffic noises  Further the walls are thin so we could hear conversations in adjoining rooms and the loud talking of the W staff late at night  The service is poor as well  When I arrived I was placed in the wrong room  I was told my room would be ready in an  minutes  An hour later I went to the front desk and they had no idea what I was talking about  Further we could not find anyone to check our bags as the staff was too busy hanging around and talking with each other  I had to force my way between two employees and ask them to take our bags  We had a similar experience retrieving our bags  A note to those with late check out privileges  you will be locked out of your room at  pm  Stop by the check in desk to get new room keys Im sorry to say that after  out of  poor W experiences we wont be staying at the W hotels  Its so sad  the W has a wonderful concept but it is both poorly executed and maintained  
P => Very Enjoyable Stay I stayed here with my eight year old and we both really enjoyed the hotel  Funky or and a very comfortable room made our stay enjoyable  This is not the place to stay if you are looking for a very traditional style hotel  Lack of a bathtub shower only might be a downside for some  No problems with the air conditioning in our room and if you are headed to Navy Pier it is within walking distance  
P => Sloppy service Checked in for  nights late in tember  The location is very good   its next to Lincoln Park which is wonderful for early morning runningjogging and is less than  mins walk from Michigan Avenue The hotel rooms were nice   roomy typical W hotel or but there was no bathtub The bathrobe was pretty old and looked as if it had shrunk after being washed a zillion times  When I complained it was promptly replaced by a different much nicer brown and white bathrobe  I am a Starwood Platinum member but did not get a suite upgrade because they were full  Instead I had a lakeview room with wonderful views but traffic noise came through loud and clear even  floors up  However this hotels main drawback is its service which comes nowhere near to the level one might expect when paying over US a night  I had breakfast one morning and the croissant that I ordered took ages to arrive  When it did I was told it was the last one available and that the waiter had to go upstairs to get it  Breakfast at  am  be late but it does not warrant that sort of comment  Dinner from room service one night was a comedy  I picked a Goose Island beer from a list that was recited to me   mins later I was told it was unavailable and I then picked a Stella Artois once again from a list that was recited to me  Lo and behold  mins later we had a replay of the earlier phone call  I ended up with a Sam Adams   days later I ordered a St Breakfast from room service but requested that the muffins be substituted for Danish pastries  I ended up with both the muffins and  pastries and got charged extra for the pastries in spite of the waiter saying that they would not be chargedI shall stay at the Westin Chicago River North in future  
P => Change the staff and the place will be better If you get a room near the elevator call to the front desk to change it  The lifts are SO noisy when you are trying to sleep and to make it worse the ice machine is also located near the elevator so I had no sleep the first night Front desk were very obliging and moved us right away  The rooms are lovely the view is great the location is superb the staff are slightly up themselves but hey they work for a trendy hotel so they at least have to try and act as if they are cool    seriously drop the attitudes smile say hello and you might get more repeat business  
P => Would stay here again I recently stayed at the W for a business trip  This was my first stay at a W hotel and I was impressed  I found the beds to be very comfortable and the or in the rooms to be contemporary and relaxing  The check in area in the lobby was a little crowded but we enjoyed relaxing at the bar and lounge  There are many nice touches that set this hotel apart from others  Our group appreciated that you could walk a couple blocks passing under Lakeshore Drive and be walking along the beautiful shore of Lake Michigan  Service was excellent too  
P => Second time around I had stayed here over New Years previously and so just wanted to update my review  Basically this time around the quality and friendliness of the staff was confirmed as well as the quality of the restaurant and bar great food and drinks and top notch staff  The concierges this time around were not only pleasant but very helpful which was not the case the last time I visited  Also I still found the shutters arating the bedroom and bathroom to be odd and off putting although I note that someone called me a privacy freak in another review for having mentioned this but at least the end panel of the bed did not fall off this time  I still think this W falls a bit short compared to other Ws but that is largely due to the building being what it is converted Days Inn with low ceilings so there was not a lot to work with to begin with although the location and views are great  The only couple off putting things this time around was the top floor bar being closed for a private party which I understand is not uncommon and the fact that there appeared to be full of family reunions and lots of kids running around  Perhaps it was just timing but usually a stay at a W is a chance to escape kids playing in elevators and runningscreaming around lobbies    Overall I rate this above average relative to other hotels in the price range in Chicago but only averagebelow average for W hotels overall  
P => awful and cheeseball This quotstylishquot hotel is essentially a bland office building dressed up in Urban Outfitters type rd tier mod  Loud wall mounted AC units which barely work  Indifferent staff The best part is they do that sneaky mini bar charge thing  Small charges that you wont notice on your card unless you scrutinize it Stay away     
P => Great Ambiance Dissapointed With Checkin We had reservations for a Saturday night stay but our room was not yet ready when I checked in promptly at  PM  This was after waiting in line for twenty minutes to reach the front desk  I was told the room was being cleaned and that we should be in quotshortlyquot At  I checked again and was told the room was still not ready and asked to speak with a Manager  It took another  minutes to have a manager come out and speak with me and then she left for  minutes and the room was suddenly ready shortly after  PM  We enjoy the ambiance of the W Lakeshore and have stayed there several times before but the sense of urgency detail and attention to guests is definitely lining in my opinion  The efficiency of the front desk for check in seems quite poor we always seem to encounter a standstill bottleneck at the front desk  This makes what should be a relaxing getaway start off frustrating  
P => Fabulous My friend and I stayed at the W for an extended weekend  I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised when I arrived  The hotel is stunning  The staff were friendly and very accommodating  We had a gorgeous room overlooking the lake  I would definitely stay here again  
P => W Gets a B I stayed at the W Lakeshore on e   I booked through Hotwire and paid  including taxes for the room a deal for the area and time period Taste of Chicago  This hotel is ideal for couples or young adults looking to have some fun  Upon checking in I was greeted with great service sometimes lacking when you book online  We had fast service for using their parking it was  for  hours and allowed you to come and go  The hotel recommended using their service as it was the safest Id have to agree as the lot is located above the lobby  I took the time to be friendly to the car parking manager Dan which proved beneficial as he allowed us to leave our car there extra hours if we needed without charge a service I saw others getting denied on  The bellman were fast and friendly and took the time to show us everything in the room  I agree that the hotel is beginning to show some wear the curtains hallways and pool area was looking pretty run down  The room itself was great if you are a very private person you will not care for the open air feeling of the bathroom a little embarassing if anyone but your loved one is sharing or in your room  The beds are great and our view was of the city versus the water but still nice  A great view of the lake can be seen from the th floor patio area  We checked out the bar on Sat night  I think anyone with a family would have been thrown off by the fact that the lobby basically turns into a bar at night people and drinks everywhere  Getting to your room was no problem but you have to take a special elevator to the rd floor to the bar  The view is great a round of drinks was  The Navy Pier is very close we walked there a couple times and the beach is also nearby  Go to the Navy Pier if you are looking for informal inexpensive dining  If you head right out of the hotel youll also find an Irish bar I dont recommend as the staff seem to give minimal and rude service to anyone looking like they are from out of town theres Chipotle and Pot Belly too for a quick lunch  For a longer walk you can check out the shops on Michigan Ave  All in all it was a good experience not as luxurious as I imagined but the location is great just dont waste your money on full price especially if you are planning to spend most of your time outside your room  
P => You cant beat the location We just returned home from the W Lakeshore Chicago and were pleased with the hotel  My wife two children  and  and I stayed there for  nights and would stay again if we ever traveled back  Although the hotel appears to cater to a different crowd singles and couples without kids the staff was very helpful with all requests and even gave both of our children a pack with a bunch of games a yoyo and water bottle upon our arrival  One cautionary note we ran into a hotel employee on our elevator ride down to go walking and he offered us some water to take with  He then asked us for our room number so that he could send up  something for the boys   We thought this was a very nice gesture but found out at checkout that he had charged the water to our room even though we never asked for it  The best thing about the hotel is the location  It is only a short walk of  blocks to Navy Pier    minute walk to Michigan Avenue and  minute walk to Millennium Park  We took a water taxi from Navy Pier to the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum to save walking in the  degree heat for  round trip per adult and  for children over  this is much less expensive then a regular taxi and a lot cooler  There is also a FREE trolley system that goes all over the city with connections at Navy Pier  The only problem is that you  have to get on and off a couple of different trolleys to get to your destination but it is FREE  The beds were VERY comfortable the claim on their website about  pillow top mattress  thread count linens and fluffy goose down pillows  was true  For a  star hotel the room was a little on the small side it fit  double beds with just enough space for a chair by the window  The only thing that I didn t care for about the room was the fold out window shutters in the wall between the bedroom and bathroom they open and close so that you can watch your spouse shower  However this could be uncomfortable if you have other people like older children staying in your room  Plus the shutters don t give you a feeling of privacy  The swimming pool was adequate in size but there was NO hot tub  My wife went up to the bar on the rd floor one night while I was tucking in the boys and told me that it isn t very large or impressive but then we weren t there for the nightlife  Be prepared to pay for parking if you bring a car the rate was  per night  Also an Internet connection in the room if needed was another  per day  We received a VERY good rate through Hotwire and felt like we hit the jackpot  It is definitely a  star hotel and again we liked staying there  
P => ent Experience Not as upscale as some W hotels but overall a clean comfortable stay and good service  Since it is the midwest and not east or west coast the staff seemed friendly without too much attitude  Being New Yorkers we welcomed this as we deal with too much attitude daily  The lobby bar is great for casual drinks and the upstairs bar is full during weekends with a little more of a scene  Yes it is dark as some of the reviews state but if you dont want contemporary with some attempt to have style then stay elsewhere  Every W is a little bit dark   its part of the whole chic atmosphere they create  Its fun and different  If you want conventional and brightly lit try another chain  My husband and I are Starwood members so weve stayed in a few Ws in the past  We were happy because this two night stay at the W Lakeshore was free via Starwood points  If we had paid full price I dont know if we would have been exceptionally impressed but we would have been satisfied The view of Lakeshore Drive and Lake Michigan were amazing  We could see fireworks at Navy Pier on Saturday night  You could not ask for a better corner of Chicago  Easy access to Mich Ave shopping and restaurants Note that valet is night  If you think youll only be doing downtown activities dont rent a car and just take cabs  If you must get a car though be aware of the valet price Overall my experience was above average  
P => Top Location Just got back from  nights at the w lakeshore Having read some poor reviews I was concerned I  have made a mistake Well I certainly dont have any regrets The hotel couldnt be in a better location The lakeparkpiershopsrestaurantsbars etc are all on your doorstep The rooms are clean The beds are really comfortable The hotel bars and food are great The staff were freindly and helpful If you were being really fussy you could say the place was slightly worn i e the carpet in the hallway was looking a bit faded and the wooden blinds in the room were a bit tatty But this is me looking for faults my fellow travelers did not pick up on this I went into the sofitel and that was absolutley fantastic but its twice the price and not as good location I would stay there again Chicago is a great place  
P => The W was ok     We spent two nights at the W on Lakeshore Drive in Chicago  The staff was excellent  The concierge was very helpful and the bellhops doormen and the rest of the staff were great  If you called down to the front desk to ask for something toothpaste razor etc they were there in about  seconds  The concierge gave us No Cover Charge passes and VIP passes no waiting in line to a few of the places we visited at night  Their restaurant suggestions were great  The hotel has its own nightlife of sorts Fri amp Sat night both were packed with people down in the lobby  The rooms however were a little on the rundown side  They tried to make them look very upscale amp ultra chic with the black ceilings modern furnishings bamboo window coverings no shower doors a quotlookoutquot from the bathroom   but they just couldnt pull it off  It was nice from afar but up close it had a very cheap feel  The rooms are smallI would not have been happy if I had paid full price for this hotel  I made my reservations through Hotwire and paid about  per night  I understand that regular rate is    I think the best thing about the hotel is their service  The rooms were your average  star hotel room  
P => Loved the W Lakeshore Just got back from my stay at the W Lakeshore and definitely recommend it WONDERFUL service from the minute I checked in to when I checked out they even allowed a late checkout when I had to make some adjustments to my original flight arrangements  All of the concierges were great suggesting several restaurants NOT just the Italian place down the street mentioned in another review which is great by the way and making special reservations as well  Another guest at the bar said that when he asked where he could find a phone charger they even offered to go out and purchase one for himThe W offers something for everyone with  fun bars and Wired the Ws business center open  hours a day only   unlimited Internet faxing and copying for those who dread the hassle of carrying a laptop through airports  Bliss products in the bathroom and a bed that you could stay in all day   but with Magnificent Mile stores so close theres lots more to do  
P => good for some families I stayed at the W with my preteen and teenage dhters for a weekend of shopping and sightseeing  The location was walking distance to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave  shopping  My dhters really enjoyed the hip atmosphere of the hotel  The pool was great because there were so few families there  The water was warm and there were not lots of out of control children screaming and taking over the pool  It was quiet and the girls had the pool to themselves  They didnt want to leave it The rooms are small but we had a great view of the city  The girls also loved the bath products  So for this family the W worked and we would stay again  
P => W is great Ive stayed at the W Lakeshore  times now and have not had a bad experience yet  The rooms are very nicely appointed and the staff very helpful  Rooms are a bit tight but neat  
P => Perfect couple getaway This is a contemporary boutique style hotel  Anyone expecting Omni or Hilton like experience will be disappointed  I loved the dark modern interior  The quotwindowquot with shutters between the bedroom and bathroom was very romantic but if you are a privacy freak you might not like it  Lots of little touches which made our anniversary stay very special CD player with a contemporary CD a great pillow spray comfy bed with a beautiful royal purple duvet cover helpful staff  Did not eat at the restaurant will when I come back for next anniversary  
P => You cant please all the people all the time Whats with these people complaining about how there was no room for their family of four No kidding What hotel room is that big Granted the rooms are a little smaller than average but not bad for a big city hotel  Any non suite hotel room will be cramped w four people in it This hotel and all Ws for that matter are geared towards couples and upscale clients  Its not Disney world  They have an image to keep up   dont get mad just because you didnt do your homework and the hotel quotwasnt what you were expectingquot  Thats your fault not the hotels  Also the way the bathroom opens up to the rest of the room is VERY sexy when you significant other is in the showerI only have two complaints   its not right on Michigan Avenue so you have to walk and while it is only a half mile it sucks in ruary Also the hallways were a little old and could use a touch up Everything else was great  The service was excellent  The food was A  I would recommend this place to anyone as long as they didnt have a family w them  
P => Comtemporary Excellence The W Lakeshore is beautiful  Yes the hallways are dark as is the lobby but if you are looking for a contemporary style this is the place  The scent of vanilla candles in the lobby is inviting  The bartenders in the lobby are very nice  In the evenings you dont have to go further than the lobby bar downstairs for a good time  There are always a fair amount of people in the lobby having a good time  The rooms are beautiful with a very comfortable bed  The lakeview is awesome  We had a lovely time at the W  I completely recommend it  The only downfalls are the pool and the fitness center  They are not very nice  
P => Just what I wanted My wife and I stayed at the W   Lakeshore for  nights after thanksgiving and we were very impressed  The contemporary or and furnishings throughout the hotel are great  The lobby is such a fun place to hang out whether it be waiting for friends reading or having a drink  The music is always inviting  The rooms are big and well furnished  Our bathroom was wonderful The staff was very knowledgable about Chicago and very friendly  My wife is anxious to visit other W hotels  
P => Awesome We were told that this was a remodeled Days Inn but chose to stay here anyways  The location of this hotel is unbeatable   everything is right around the corner within walking distance  We stayed here spring  and we couldnt have picked a more sunnier weekend The staff at the hotel is great and the vibe is even better  If youre looking for a young hip place to stay stay here We were upgraded to a lakeshore view room on one of the higher floors  The bar on top is awesome If yourre looking for great italian food eat at MIA FRANCESCA for dinner we loved it Hope this helped 
P => Overrated overpriced pain in the       I stayed here recently and I was disappointed  This is a typical W  Dark interior cool looking lobby area with bar young employees nice beds premium rates  BUT here are the problems only average service average fitness area elevators are too small not enough elevatorsI was trying to leave the hotel on a Monday morning and had to let  full elevators pass by before I could catch one  and I was on the th floor  On the way down we stopped at  or  floors and waiting guests could only look in and shake their heads One other thing strangely it appeared that around   of the guests were male  It was a football weekend but I dont know if that would cause this  This is not a bad place to stay but there are many others in Chicago that offer better service better location and a better value  
P =>  W onderful        This was my first time staying at a quotWquot and from my experience at the Lakeshore if there is ever a quotwquot to stay at I will not stay anyplace else  Though my room was not available for early check in nor was it available at regular PM check in time I was given a room on a higher floor as a result  The check in staff was very efficient and helpful and my room was incredible  view overlooking the lake and the Navy Pier  The Suite with a fabulous bed and hotel were extremely clean and just very cool in general  I was known by name immediately after I checked in and felt instantly like I was a part of some really funky new family  The concierges of which I think  different ones helped me were all very informed and gave me excellent advice  Jerry ie and Sheryl were particularly helpful and did everything in their power to see that I had the ultimate quotWquot experience  I thank all of the staff at the quotWquot from the doormen to the management for the excellent service and being able to all work together as a team who presents itself as one who really enjoys what they do  
P => W Lakeshore is Wonderland Great hotel with fantastic service  Love the amenities  
P => The Best Downtown Hotel My stay at the W Lakeshore was wonderful  The rooms were fabulous as well as the courteous staff that made sure my stay was excellent  The hotels modern rooms were awesome I would recommend this hotel to all my friends 
P => W onderful I loved this place From the great reception at check in and the friendly and informative bell staff to the heavenly feather bed and outstanding view of the lake Ive stayed at many different hotels in Chicago in the past but will make it a point of returning to the quotWquot     both Lakeshore AND City Centre 
P => Great ambiance Staying at the W Lakeshore was a great experience  The staff was very accommodating and friendly  The views from the room were incredible and the or was trendy  I would definitely stay at the hotel again and recommend it to friends 
P => What a Great Place This place was great I live in Chicago and wanted to do a get away in the city with a friend from out of town  We checked in on Friday around pm  The vibe was great From the music lighting botanicals and what a VIEW All you see is Lake Michigan from the lobby or as they call it the Living room  The room was great and again the view of the lake from the room was awesome  We loved the bed and the calming d cor of the room it was very cool  In the morning we rented bikes from the hotel and went down the lakefront  My friend loved the view of the city from the lake  Bike rentals were an unexpected nice touch for a hotel  But I guess it only makes sense being on the lake and all  Bottom line   I definitely will search out W Hotels for my travels  The staff is great  I think the atmosphere they work in makes them so happy that they are just a pleasure to deal with  I think I heard  Welcome to Wonderland  from every one of them by the time I left  Kinda cheesey but I guess we all need a gimmick  I think they have really got it  Comfort but not cold fun but professional resort but urban  Hats off to you 
P => Love the beds I love this hotel Everytime Im in Chicago I stay here  The lake view rooms are worth the extra cost theres nothing like taking a shower and over looking Lake Michigan  The beds like all W beds are out of this world  The staff I encountered were friendly more than willing to give restaurant recommendations outside of the hotel  The layout of the room is fantastic lots of cool dark colors to add to the atmosphere The only drawback might be if youre traveling with kids its not really a hotel for families with small children but being a single person I didnt mind that at all  
P => Rude employee for work i travel quite often especially to chicago  I like to try different hotels whenever Im in chicago and ive stayed at the W lakeshore before and thought that the employees were pretty rude but i really like the bed and the ambiance of the room  Therefore when my friend came over from Germany we ided to meet up in Chicago and stayed at the W hotel for one night during the week since we both had to fly out to some other cities around chicago and  more nights on the weekend  I was trying to reach him at the hotel since he checked in first and the front desk personnel who answered the phone was REALLY RUDE and kept telling me there was no guest by my friends last name and when I spelled out my last name since the reservation was also under mine and it was a long last name he just cut me in the middle and transferred me to reservation The reservation lady didnt quite understand why I was being transferred there but she was able to locate our reservation  So I called the hotel back to be connected to the room and AGAIN the same person kept telling me in a very rude way that there was no guest by that name until he realized that he did not hear the name correctly  Seriously for a hotel of this caliber it can afford to employ more courteous and polite employees for that particular hotel employee i really dont get what your problem is   if you dont like to work in hospitality then QUIT This is the second disappointment Ive had in the past  days w Starwood hotels  The other one was with Westin   Century Plaza and Spa in LA  No wonder I dont have that many points in my SPG account but have millions in riott Rewards  Yes I cancelled my second reservation for the weekend shortly after that  There are plenty of other nice hotels in Chicago 
P => Perfect spot for weekend exploration I grew up in Chicago and go back often to visit family  My other half and I ided to surprise my family and show up for a family reunion so we picked the W and ided to play toursit for a few days  First I must say downtown Chicago has made a huge comeback since I lived there over  years ago  Millenium Park is amazing and Michigan Avenue is thriving  The W is close to everything yet located in a quiet spot on the lakefront  The service was perfect   others can learn about how to treat guests  The beds were an inspiration with pillowtop mattresses and high quality cotton bedding  Really cool furnishings and very clean  Definitely a place to come back to  
P => This place has it all What a fantastic hotel Worth every dollar spent    even for the overpriced drinks at the two bars Was there y   for Manchester United soccer game  Walked into the lobby fresh from the airport and was met by three of the most gorgeous women imaginable    all employees of the hotel  The bar in the lobby was loaded with beautiful women  Was awestruck by the five star quality room I was given    had a fantastic view as well  Whiskey Sky Bar on the top floor was just as great as the lobby  This place will ALWAYS be my first choice in Chicago  It is well located for tourism shopping and best of all nightlife One note this hotel is not for the faint at heart    like most W Hotels its for the young or young at heart andor hip who like to hang out real real late  I loved it 
P => Great Views and a Smy Pool Like all W Hotels the Lake Shore is modern and quothipquot with incredible beds  The location on Lake Shore Drive is excellent with views of Lake Michigan Navy Pier and the city skyline I wont mention the quotreclamation plantquot  We had a room on the th floor overlooking the lake excellent view of Navy Pier and nightly fireworks  The or is somewhat dark the ceilings are painted black but lots of interesting lighting and an entire wall of windows  The bathroom had an inside window with wooden shutters looking into the bedroom the shutters however could be opened from the bedroom eliminating privacy  The Whiskey Bar on the rd floor is in need of a facelift  It is extremely dark lit only by votive candles burn holes in the leather bench and chairs copious spider webs on the outside of the windows How did they get up there  Be prepared for sticker shock a plain label rum and coke is    If youre flush on cash there are plenty of premium spirits at   a bottle  On the th floor there is a work out room indoor pool and outdoor lounge area  The louge chairs had their legs cut off so they  as well have been pads on the concrete  I wouldnt get in the pool on a bet the water was cloudy and smy looking with a slimey brownish growth on the bottom  The W is pet friendly a quotlitter boxquot and drinking bowls are right out the front door with other areas ked with a bone shaped sign designated for them to do their business  Michigan Avenue shopping is four city blocks away easy walking distance  Turn left and  blocks up is the Chicago River doubleker sightseeing bus kiosks and architectural boat cruises  Most of the great restaurants require a cab ride and are plentiful  I have mixed reviews for the staff from over the top quotIm here to help you enjoy our cityquot to disinterested and non helpful  Overall the hotel is great if you dont look too closely  
P => Awesome hotel but pricey This hotel was amazing  Below are my bulleted comments about the good and not so good The Good  The location is awesome  You can walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave  It is a short cab ride away to all other Chicago attractions   The zen or was beautiful  The rooms were beautiful  We asked for and upgrade to a suite and they were kind enough to accommodate us even on a weekend it  have helped that Im a Gold Starwood member so I dont know if they do that for everyone   The service of every single staff person was amazing   The exercise room and pool were very nice   The view of the lake was nice  The city view rooms arent as great but cheaper   The beds are heavenly as they are in all the Westins Ws and some Sheratons   The bath care products were Aveda and were awesome   It has three of the hottest and swakiest bars in all of Chicago  The bar on the top floor is a see and be seen bar of Chicago  It was pretty cool to stay at such a happenin place The Not so Good  I was able to use some Starwood points for the stay or else I dont know that we could have afforded the room  Everything else was very pricey i e  parking is night but we found this to be about the going rate at all other hotels and public parking in the area  I cant think of anything else that wasnt good about this hotel  You just have to know going into it that it will be pricey but it is well worth it because it is an amazing hotel  
P => Great Hotel I love the W  To all the reviewers who say the bamboo blinds let too much sun in check behind them  There are sun shades that completly block out the sun  The hotel is clean and the beds are the best  
P => What a nighte If you want to enjoy your visit to Chicago then avoid this nighte of a hotel  It is run more like a dormitory or frat house attached to a nightclub  There are long lines at night for GUESTS to use the elevators and theyre supervised by rudethug like bouncers  The couple in the room next to me were screaming at each other at  AM  The room across from my friends had at least  people in it and they started their rampage at  AM  People go up and down with their drinks all night from one bar to another  The management was ginally responsiveapologetic  We were so disgusted we checked out after only one night and went to the Fairmont where we had much bigger rooms for much less   it was a welcome and refreshing change I would highly recommend the Fairmont  
P => Dissapointed I am a travel agent that lives about  miles outside of downtown Chicago and over the years Ive had many opportunites to stay downtown at different hotels for various reasons  I chose this hotel because Id heard many great things about the W properties from clients and friends so I thought it would be perfect for  girls looking for a hip trendy hotel for the night  My first impression upon entering the hotel was that it was very funky fun and yet somehow tranquil in a minimalist sort of way  The staff and service I received upon check in getting directions to a club and check out were great and on par with how I expected to be treated at a hotel of this caliber  Where my disspointment comes from with this property is in the rooms themselves  The rooms are very small   there isnt much room to maneuver between the end of the beds and the counter that holds the tv mini bar etc  The lighting is awful   in the bathroom and in the bedroom  Trying to put on makeup for the evening was a complete joke and we all left asking each other if we had too much on because we couldnt see what we were doing  The color scheme in the room doesnt make this any easier either since everything is done up in dark browns black cherry black etc  The ceiling itself is even painted dark brown which certainly doesnt help reflect light  The one positive thing that I can say about the room is that the beds are as wonderful as they say they are  Amazingily soft and luxurious   it would have been probably the best night of sleep in a hotel bed that Id ever had except for the fact that there was only a bamboo woven mat shade covering the windows that did absolutely nothing in the way of blocking out any morning light  Needless to say after getting to bed at am werent happy about being woken up by bright sunshine at am  I would not recommend this hotel to people with kids anyone looking for a spacious and well lit room or for late night people unless you plan on bringing a sleep mask to block out the sunlight  For an overall more comfortable pleasant stay in downtown Chicago I highly recommend the Hyatt Regency Swissotel Sheraton Embassy Suites or Hilton  
P => This hotel is fun  This is a fun hotel  Firstly children are treated perfectly there games cribs a child menu  not on paper but in the whateverwhenever   Secondly the staff though a bit condescending are like extra in a  movie the whole place is very very amusing with humorous reformulations a bellman is a welcome ambassador original or  It is relaxing to be in a place which is so different  The rooms are not big but they are very comfortable  Service was fantastic and prompt Will go back there and to all Ws anywhere  
P => Ok Hotel Stayed  nights at the W  Room in terms of design and comfort is superb although  need some extra lighting for the color scheme makes the whole room dark  I love the the bathroom very stylish and different  I wish I can say the same thing about W staff  Most of the staff has no style or panache  The staff at the restaurant does not have their act together  On our first stay our foodserve looks untidy black pants is fading looks like it has not been wash for days  to make it worst he switch our bill with another customer  The other customer was peeved  It seems that eveyone including people hanging out on the lobby tries hard to be cool and hip  Well they all tried but fortunately didnt quite make it  Overall it is a good hotel  Its just the staff need some training how to run a sophisticated hotel   like Hotel Monaco   
P => LoveHate Relationship Ten our my girlfriends stayed the weekend for a Bachlorette Party  Most of us had mixed reviews  Each room has something wrong with it yet it was still fabulous  As I stated we had a LoveHate Relationship with The W Hotel Lakeshore  Love The or was hip the beds were O so comfortable the view is the best in Chicago  The hotel is clean and provides everything you need  Just being there makes you feel very sexy  Hate The rooms are so dark you cant find anything you are looking for  Girls beware of trying to put makeup on  Our sink was constanlty clogged  One of the  rooms wasnt ready for check in until PM  The staff at the restaurant was very unorganized  Id definetly stay again considering it is the best hotel Ive stayed at in Chicago but next time Ill pack a flashlight  
P => Love those W beds What a great hotel The beds are wonderful you might not want to get up in the morning  All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful  The bar aka Living Room was a fun place to hang out with friends and have a drink or two  The food wasnt bad from the bar menu didnt make it to the restaurant  Like some other reviewers said this really isnt the place to bring kids as it does have an adult atmosphere  Do yourself a favor and splurge for a lake view room  You can take a shower while looking out over the lake  The hotel is only a short cab ride away from anything in the city  Like most Ws the halls are a bit dark as are the rooms but it just helps to add to the atmosphere of the place  I love all the W hotels Ive stayed at but I think this one is my favorite  The color scheme in the rooms are relaxing and romantic lots of black tan and red  Ill be back  
P => Fun   A much needed quotGirls Weekendquot  First time in a W  Now we understand what all the rave is about We had a ball  Super hotel Definately different than any other place weve ever stayed  Not for all travelers though  Funky sexy chic loud music busy  fun fun fun So far from our lives as young moms with  young children at home  We traveled for a long weekend       I highly recommend this hotel  GREAT STAFF very personable and accomodating  Book it youll be glad you did  
P => Nice Place The W Lakeshore is a wonderful hotel though certainly developed for a certain crowd  This as are most W hotels has   year old affluent people in mind as its clientele  If you prefer more traditional luxury like the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton or are traveling with a family do yourself a favor and do not stay here  You will not be happy My girlfriend and I stayed here one night to relax we go to school in Chicago and both of us loved the hotel  To feel comfortable in the public areas of this hotel dress well  It is a very chic styled hotel though not cheap or cheezy  The lobby turns into a night club atmosphere at night The service we received was as good as I have ever experienced at a Park Hyatt or Four Seasons  We checked in at about  PM on a Saturday evening  The SPG line was quick and we were upgraded without question  At breakfast the next morning in the Wave restaurant we had free continental breakfast but our waiter gave us the entire menu for free The rooms undoubtedly are small as the hotel is a converted Days Inn  Nonetheless they are wondefully furnished  The bed as in most Starwood hotels is second to none  The hotel certainly has the best view of any hotel in Chicago  The bathrooms are very cool  There is an Asian wood paneled sliding door and nothing surrounding the shower makes for a very nice morning shower with the girlfriend   Check out was a breeze  So all in all I thought it was a very cool hotel with excellent service  Though again I caution you in choosing this hotel  The rooms are far too small for a family  The bathrooms are not cool unless youre traveling with someone you feel comfortable being naked around  Also the night atmosphere is certainly not for small children or adults who prefer a more laid back atmosphere  But if you like a hip place and to hang out with the in crowd chances are you will enjoy this hotel  
P => W Hotel Lakeshore Terrible checked into the W lakeshore on thurs    th   I have always been a very big fan of W Hotels unfortunetly this W Hotel along with the two before this were absolutely horrible   I had reserved a superior king room for three nights at the W Lakeshore  The lobby was nice but it ended there   when we exited our cab the attendants stood there as we lifted all of our bags out of the cab by ourselves and opened the door to the hotel as they stood and talked to each other   the rooms are incredibly small they are run down dirty smell and are very loud   for the amount of money they charge it should be a crime  It is basically a holiday inn express that has been painted with odd colors and had a large W slapped on it   on friday morning I spoke with a manager who allowed us to check out two days earlier because of all the problems   we switched to the Penisula Hotel what an amazing hotel im here right now   Overall W Hotels have gone way downhill the lakeshore is a total rip off and so small you cant get out of your own way   they charge a gratuity on the mini bar of   i have never seen that before nor did a waitress pop out of my minibar to serve me a drink  The rooms are disgusting they smell and are very loud   I really did love W Hotels I dont know what has happened but spend your money elsewhere this hotel is expensive and you dont receive anything but dirty smelly loud rooms with an extremely rude person at the WHENEVER WHATEVER desk   I truly would not recommend this hotel  Thanks to the manager of the hotel for allowing us to leave after being there only  hours   that was the best part   for a few dollars more you can stay in hotels that are  times better   even a few dollars less you could probably get more   shame on W Hotels for ripping people off like that  I will never stay at a W Hotel again   Whatever happened when Starwood bought them has been a HUGE mistake    
P => The W is wonderful As the owner of a Spa my days are filled with taking care of others  I needed to be in Chicago the week of Labor Day  to attend work related classes  So I thought I would leave a few days early and have some quotMequot time  I love the water so I looked for a hotel that would position me perfectly to take advantage of the lake  Well I found it The W Lakeshore is right on the Lake and is a stones throw from Navy Pier  I booked a room with a view and watched people night and day walking biking and swimming  My room also had a perfect view of the Navy Pier Ferris Wheel  It was beautiful  When I arrived in Chicago my bags didnt This has never happened to me before and I was stunned   Note to travelers  dont fly ATA   Once I arrived at the W I just made it in time for my pre scheduled facial and massage at their spa  At first I was taken aback because when I spoke to someone on the phone I asked if she was their quotspa directorquot to which she replied quotYesquot  Well the quotspaquot consists of two rooms inside the gym The check in desk is an x hotel room with a computer and phone  But after having the services  which were top notch  I realized that size doesnt matter A good spa experience is more of a feeling anyway  So on to the hotel details  This is an uber Urban hotel  Super cool  But not snobby in any way  One warning however if you have work to do which requires leaving your room early be warned the beds are SOO comfy you might miss all your early appointments I have fallen completely in LOVE with the rooms at the W  I noticed how every design detail is squarecubed and was surprised how comforting that was  The shower is unique and incredible  They supply you with a CD player which I thought quotGreat I didnt bring any CDsquot  Not to worry they also supply you with a CD for your listening pleasure that is available for sale in the shop downstairs  So heres what I did  I ordered room service and a bottle of wine put on the groovy CD hopped into the shower  which has a rainhead  and gazed out my window  from the shower  out onto the gorgeous lake Oh did I mention they also give you a TEDDY BEAR I LOVE THIS PLACE Since I didnt have ANYTHING upon arrival the W provided me with everything I could have wanted or needed to be clean and comfortable  When I left I left behind a note which said quotIts so nice to feel taken care of  Thank You for a Wonderful Experience quot

P => Not a  star hotel Im surprised by the reviews here because we were disappointed by this hotel  It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service  The or of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated looks like it hasnt been touched for years  The other big gripe was with the reception staff who were rude  There was absolute chaos in the reception on the afternoon of new years eve   it appeared the hotel was overbooked and the place resembled a refugee camp The only positive was the view from the room which was stunning  But the location is a little isolated   not a massive deal but its a brisk  minute walk to anywhere in the city centre and it can be very brisk in Chicago at this time of year  There are loads of good hotels in the city centre which offer bargain deals   go for one of those instead  
P => Quiet clean and close to the Magnificent mile We took a chance and booked our first trip to Chicago through Priceline and ended up staying here ember  through th  for an unbelievable price lower than any I saw posted here  After reading all the comments I felt we should add our experience  The Swissotel was a great place to stay rooms were very clean and quiet at night for a great nights rest with extremely comfortable beds and high quality bedding  The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful switching our room to one with  double beds from a king even suggesting local restaurants to eat at just a short walk away  The pool located on the  floor was also nice although the health equipment charge seems a little odd  The hotel is just  blocks from the Magnificent Mile for shopping eating or just watching people with lots of things to do in all price ranges  Several nearby Walgreens also  We ided not to use the hotel parking at  a night and parked next door at  E Wacker at  a night  Just park the car elevator to the first floor open the door and you are at the Swissotel  There are several other parking garages nearby  E Wacker and of course Millennium Park   blocks away  The free trolley system pick up is right next door at the Hyatt and takes you all over downtown as well as the Navy Pier and the Field Museum Campus  It would have been a prefect stay if there was some kind of breakfast included in the hotel price and if you could use the in room refrigerator without the sensor going off you move anything on it or in it and you will have a charge on you bill to dispute  Would we stay here again Absolutely We enjoyed our stay both at the hotel and Chicago It was great 
P => Terrific hotel if you get it at a good price Booked this through a special deal for night  Its a great hotel at that price  I even had to cancel a day off the reservation because of flight cancellation but front desk had no problems and no penalties with that  Cab from Midway cost    tip and there was no traffic whatsoever even during rush hour  Chicago is awesome this way compared to NYC The rooms were very clean  We had a pretty bad view on the th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan east north or west is probably nice too Theres some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit  Bed was comfortable bath robes were luxurious room was large with a good desk for working The strawberry and orange water in the lobby was a nice touch The health club is excellent  Mostly empty with a wonderful pool and a hot tub with jacuzzi  Weight room and cardio room was well equipped even though I didnt get a chance to use Palm restaurant is great  Ive been to the one in Washington D C  and Las Vegas and this one is the best tastewise  Friendly service The few complaints I had were as follows   refrigerator was stocked with food that was weight sensitive  The moment you remove an item youre charged even if you replace it within  seconds  I didnt even open the refrigerator or touch it for fear of setting off the Indiana Jones boobytrap  It would have been nice to be able to put my store bought Gatorade into the refrigerator Additionally elevators are the slowest Ive ever encountered  They take forever to pick you up  I literally waited  minutes one time for an elevator to stop and take me to the pool on  Also no continental breakfast All in all an excellent stay   close to the southern end of the Magnificent mile and not too far a walk to the Art Institute and the Shedd and Field museum  
P => its good No doubt the cleanliness   the or everything is Ajust one small problem you have to wqalk faaaaar to long for the nearest Starbucks Wallgreens and the remaining shops   else there is nothing wrong great room  nice channels     cosy 
P => A Touch of Class A friend and I ided to have a long weekend in Chicago to get away from it all  Swiss tel midway between the bustle of North Michigan Avenue and the Loop seemed an attractive proposition  The hotel website offered what it called quotPackage Field Museumquot with the quotSwiss Lakeview Roomquot for  for the both of us per night for three nights  This package included a free trip to the Field which as it happens we didnt use complementary use of their well equipped gym on the rd floor which I used on Friday morning at   watching the dawn come up over Lake Michigan and most especially complementary breakfast  I just hate hotels which do not offer this  Nothing is worse than realising too late that the hotel will charge an arm and a leg for breakfast   la carte or offer nothing at all sending you out to fend for yourself in the morning  In fact this item on the agenda is what clinched it  And what a buffet breakfast it was assorted cereals assorted fruit juices fresh fruit including raspeberries strawberries blackberries bluberries pineapple melon orange watermelon bananas apples I have never seen such a spread of fruit Plus the usual cooked items pancakes sausages bacon etc I dont eat cooked breakfast so I cant vouch for the range but it too looked very big  Then to round it off a big variety of cakes and breads  I was so stuffed after breakfast that lunch and dinner became nominal It was superb  The views from the th corner room floor were great  The room was spacious and well appointed  We did have an argumentative lavatory which blocked each day we were there and which was unblocked each time we got back having mentioned it to the conci ge each morning on the way out  Ah for perfection    The total bill for three days after the state and city taxes were added which total is not mentioned at the time of booking came to just over  for the two of us  Oh something else which took us too long to find out  The hotel is connected underground to Michigan Avenue through various corridors and lobbies except on weekends when it is all closed  We arrived in    wind chill conditions and this piece of information would have been most welcome  There are a few entrances which look like big office entrances on the east side of Michigan south of Wacker just go in and ask for directions to Swiss tel  Enjoy 
P => Great location   ent hotel with  problem Stayed here  night over Thanksgiving weekend  Probably my th different hotel Ive stayed in downtown Chicago and would be in the middle of the pack  Location was nice because it is in a neutral location between the loop area the north michigan ave area and the waterfrontpark  Was able to check in before noon which was great  The room was nice and spacious with a good view of the water and Grant Park  Nice large bathroom with erate shower and bathtub  Comfy bed  The problem we had was the room wouldnt get cool even with the ac blasting all afternoon  I had a repair person come in to check it out and they did but said they couldnt get it any lower than it is  Which was strange because the hallway was a nice temp but our room was warm and stuffy  So they opened up the window for us with their allen wrenches  That helped out but they could only crack the window so still not as cool as I like  Oh and the ice maker on our floor was broken so I had to go up  floors for one that worked  Other than these problems not a bad stay  
P => Great view from the room Great location for all the main sights and restaurants You can walk everywhere and its well worth doing this so you take in all the sights and sounds of the city In terms of getting into the centre of Chicago from the airport just follow the signs for the train and get on the blue line  This runs right into the middle of the city  For this hotel get off at the Clark stop and its about a     minute walk from there  The cost of a return trip for  was   a real bargin since it takes about     minutes on the train to reach the centre  
P => Pretty ent Business Hotel This is a good quality business hotel although I do think its terrible to charge day for internet and day for the gym  Internet access is via ethernet cable Check in was below average the woman who checked us in barely made eye contact the entire time and was just generally grouchy  I like the duvets   very cozy and theyre white so you dont have to get grossed just thinking about sitting on the bed  Mini bar is one of those sensor ones which I didnt know and moved around all the bottles and now I have to go down to the front desk and tell them I only had a diet coke  Bathroom has arate tub and shower which is nice  Personally for me the location is just okay  Youre not really in the heart of things   if youre here for pleasure I would try staying on Michigan or a block or two off of it  The gym has a couple of treadmills bikes and ellipticals  No free weights  Pool looks nice  Gym is on the top floor so views are really great  View from my hotel room is pretty fanstastic  out onto Navy Pier and Lake Michigan  Thats probably one of the nicest things about the hotel Nice touch in the lobby with the ice water and orange slices  So  overall pretty ent but nothing spectacular  
P => Overall a nice place but a few minor inconveniences The Swissotel was pleasant and clean  The lobby and check in area is okay although its certainly not as grand as those areas in the Palmer House Hilton or the Renaissance  Our st floor room was clean spacious and tastefully orated and it was very quiet on our floor  We never had to wait long for an elevator  The toiletries were similar to those in other major downtown hotels  There was a arate tub and shower stall  The toilet didnt always flush completely so we sometimes needed to hold the handle down for the entire flushing sequence or we had to flush more than once  A minor inconvenience   The volume control on the TV remote didnt work and the picture on the TV was too dark but viewable  We didnt ask anyone to replace or fix the TV remote nor did we ask anyone to come in and adjust the TV picture  We couldnt find any controls on the remote that would allow us to adjust the TV picture although its possible that such a control was there  Ah for the days of having manual controls on the TV   We were on the south side of the building so the view was just okay  between two buildings you could see part of the Gehry designed structure in Millennium Park  If wed been on the northwest side the view of Navy Pier the river and Lake Michigan wouldve been great All in all a pleasant enough stay but there were enough fit and finish glitches that I give it  stars instead of  stars  Wed stay there again without hesitation since none of the issues reported in this review were major problems  
P => Spacious room with a stunning view Our spacious room on the rd floor looked out over the Chicago River the Navy Pier and the Lake Michigan shore  The room was comfortably furnished with a king bed a desk and comfortable chair with ottoman  It was extremely quiet  we couldnt hear our neighbors or people in the hall  The minibar was well stocked with soft drinks at   each  We could also buy a half literbottle of Evian water for    In the last hotel I stayed in bottled water was complimentary  Their fitness center is nice but will cost you another   as will internet access The hotel is well located  several blocks from Millenium Park The Art Institute Michigan Avenue shopping and many fine restaurants This is a very well run hotel which is as it should be considering our one nights stay cost us over   For that we should have at least received a complimentary bottle of water and free access to the fitness center  
P => Wonderful in Every Way What a tremendous value  for this  star hotel perfectly situated at the beginning of the Magnificent Mile  Everything was wonderful including the staff and service  
P => Very Clean But Rude Service First of all let me say that the location althoughquotout of the wayquot in some manner is rather a luxury It is within walking distance if you are fit to walkto most of the attractions in the city including themediocre and overrated quotmall typequot Navy Pier  The riveris directly in front of the hotel and the view of theNavy Pier is wonderful if you are lucky enough to geta room there  Now on the side of the service andstaff there is a real quotsnobbishquot attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel except as luggagehandlers toilet cleaners and car parkers  With thissaid they were very rude and utilitarian not evenasking me if I needed help with my luggage I had bags in total and I had to come back twice to get themup to the room while being stared at by the quotroboticlikequot security thugs  The hotel has no charm thelackluster and practical design might move fans ofGropius but it is severely lacking in warmth or charm It is CLEAN though I must give them that  Uponentering the hallway to the rooms the or changesfrom the mild pragmatic blandness of the lobby to acozy down home flowers and stripes pattern thatreally works well after a day of hard sight seeing The room is very clean not too large and the plus isthe bathroom which boasts one of the best androomiest showers I have ever had the pleasure ofusing  The neat rock tiles and cleanliness add to thedark color there is even a large bath to usealthough I did not take the opportunity because I wasparanoid of getting a fungal infection at the time The downturn is in the parking fee which is somethinglike   a night and is absurd considering my carwas lost for a few hours in the dingy cement stylebasement  So in all I would definitely stay hereagain even though the service stinks the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs the rooms make up for it  The cheaper placeto park is on Michigan Ave by the Art Institute in oneof the city run underground parking chambers it isonly about  blocks away if you are up for it  
P => Very Good Very nice hotel good rooms great bathrooms and good breakfast Location is good for tourists and views are spectacular I would recommend this for any one staying in Chicago  
P => Great views great location Stayed here for  nights in late tember  During the week its mainly a business hotel but there were lots of families with small children at the weekend and became rather noisier  Reception was efficient but not warm  Our room on the th floor was good plenty of space and a wonderful view over the yacht club inas to Lake Michigan  Bathroom was a good size  Air con and internet connections were efficient  The one bad point was a note on top of the minibar forbidding you to put anything in to keep cool and that infractions would be met with a charge on top of the cost of the room  We got round this by using the free ice machines and bucket  We ate breakfast in the Lobby Lounge where the two waitresses were friendly and welcoming   top k to them  On the last night we ate in the Palm Restaurant where we were overwhelmed by our waiter   it felt like we were taking part in an audience participation show rather than having a meal  But the food was good and fresh This hotel has a great location   as it boasts quotwhere the river meets the lakequot two minutes from Michigan Avenue and the majority of the major tourist attractions are within walking distance or easily reached on public transport  
P => great breakfast great view and great service My room had a great view of Lake Michigan  I enjoyed waking each morning to see the blue sky and shimmering water of the lake  The breakfast is a jewel Its downstairs a little out of the way and is fabulous  Very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price  The front desk staff was friendly as well  My room was very comfortable   glass enclosed shower jaccuzi tub and cozy bed  Id stay there again  
P => Great location We stayed here for five nights in tember   It was raining when we got to the hotel and it was nice the rest of the time we were there  Check in was smooth and we confirmed non smoking high up floor  When we got to the room right at the door it smelled of smoke  Not necessary in the room itself but right at the door  We turned on the AC and it was fine  The health club and pool and spa were nice  Its  day for the health club and the business center charges   per  minutes to check e mail and internet  The pool and spa are free  Its a drag when its a first class hotel and they nickel and dime you Room service was great  We called several times and within  minutes our food was at the door  We would leave typically between  am and be back about pm to change for dinner  Our room was always made up  One day we left before am and came back about  and the room was not cleaned up  No sign of the houekeeper or their cart  My husband had at a conference call at  so we went to the front desk and asked them to see that our room be cleaned  We went for a walk and returned about  and everything was cleaned up  Overall it was great  We would stay here again  
P => Great views I was surprised at how much I liked this hotel because there does not seem to be much hype about it in the travel books  I have stayed at four other hotels in Chicago and this is my favorite so far  I really liked our room it was clean and comfortable and had the amenities that I appreciate in a hotel room  I really liked the bathroom and thought the view from the room was just great especially at night The location of the hotel is also good and the staff seemed friendly  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more orative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has  I would defiantly stay at this hotel again 
P => Absolutely Superb Stayed here for a night at the end of ust The room was just excellent  we had views of lake michigan millennium park and other buildings the location was superb next to magnificent mile and a short walk to navy pier The concierge were really helpful and they also have really nice complimentry strawberry and orange water in the reception area We felt it was the best hotel room we have ever stayed in   so spacious We booked on hotwire and got what we felt was a really good price via the   wacker drive option for The only downside was the Chicago weather which took away the beautiful view on the nd day But the hotel gave us an umbrella to use for the dayA highly highly recommended hotel 
P => Just off MI Ave and on the Lake Swissotel Chicago is on the corner of the river and lake just about  blocks off Michigan Ave  Be prepared for slightly uphill walk if you are shopping MI Ave  That is the only downside to the location but you  enjoy the access south to Millenium Park  The Chicago bus does come in front and along with El rail very easy to use  Rooms were good nothing spectacular about them except the views  The building is tirangular shaped and we could see Millenium Park  Bath is roomy with arate shower  Single sink and tub were nice also  Room included desk amp chair along with casual chair amp ottoman  Overall good but not great   hotel  The rate we received on travelzoo special nt for labor day weekend was ok  If you want to be in the middle on MI ave shopping this is not the best location but a nicer hotel at ent rate less than  this is a good choice  
P => OK but expected better  I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago for  nights ust st tember rd  I booked my room via Priceline COM and got a ent rate I think the hotel overall is good not great  I have stayed at many nice hotels in this class before  I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view  This is the only Swissotel in the US now as the Boston one I believe is now a Hyatt The hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when I checked in  At anytime in my stay I only saw at most  agents and many times there was a line  I thought that the concierge staff was OK certainly not too pleasant but adequate  I got an early check in by calling the hotel the morning of my arrival  I was happy to be able to check my stuff in at AM vs  PM  Granted they put me in a room by the elevator on the rd floor but I wasnt about to complain  Quite honestly there wasnt a lot of noise outside my door and I was not in the room a lot of the time Regarding the room itself though there was a problem with my minibar the refrigerator didnt work  The internet accessguest servicesmovie selection didnt work either  Of course I called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently  I hung up and just dealt with it I didnt want the hassle when I am on my way outside to enjoy the beautiful weather I had while I was there  So the issue never got resolved and I am sure the next guest had to deal with it  I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest servicesmovie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night  Also that the water in the hotel would be turned off from AM AM  I took an early shower that morning  The view from my room was really nice for the most part but I wasnt going to be sitting in my room staring out the window either The location on Wacker Drive is fine in that you can walk a couple blocks up to Michigan Avenue  Its a block away from the Hyatt which I have also stayed at and isnt as nice as the Swissotel but at least its better staffed  Its two blocks from Millenium Park which is very nice  There are a couple of fountains in Millenium Park designed for kids to play in that is nice if you are staying here during the warmer months  Perhaps my room was the only one that didnt have a working refrigratorminibar  I would say if the company is paying for it the hotel is fine  However if you are doing this for a special Chicago experience look elsewhere  There are better hotels and better locations to be at in Chicago  
P => Nice but you can do better I travel to Chicago on business fairly often and have stayed in about a dozen different four star properties  This was my first time at the Swissotel and while its not quotbadquot in any significant way I think one should at least consider other hotels unless the Swissotel can be had at a bargain rate  My room was paid for but I noticed the rate was   and I dont think its worth THAT kind of money  The view of the river and Navy Pier was certainly great and it was quiet there but the room itself was just so so  Once you shut the door and without the view you wouldnt necessarily think you were in a luxury hotel in a major city  Furnishings were nothing special and kind of worn  The shower was a stall with a curtain and the shower head was at about shoulder level for a man of just average height no place to put anything either  By the time the shower was over even with the curtain closed there was a lot of water on the floor etc  Toilet seat would NOT stay up on its own not much counter space by the sink and when you open the door to the room it swings open and stays there on its own until its ready to automatically close  And I never could tell exactly what they meant by the term quotSwiss hospitalityquot I kept hearing about  When the TV check out system wouldnt work I called to check out and the voice on the other end cut me off and said quotits all taken care ofquot in about half a nano second like I was a huge interruption to something really important  I agree with other reviewers who found the staff to be efficient but not terribly personable  None of these things is a big deal alone obviously but I have to say Ive been more impressed with hotels like the Intercontinental the Sofitel the Sheraton along the river the riott on Michigan Ave  the W downtown or the Drake at this price  If you can get a bargain for the Swissotel then it should certainly be on your list  All things being equal though I would opt for one of the others Ive mentioned at least to compare before you ide  
P => Chicago as always is a great city Stayed here for  nights th and th y booked with purelyamerica   for nights great location great views we were on the th floor over looking city Wrigle building and chicago river   Where ever you are in this hotel you get great views we loved sitting in the jacuzzi on the nd floor over looking navy pier lake michigan and the city  For my  yrs old dhter it was one of the many highlights of our holiday  We recommend the buffet breakfast  Staff were friendly  
P => A for y th   th I stayed at the Swissotel from y  th for a business trip  I have to say I really though this was a great hotel  The beds were extremely comfortable rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well  I felt like I was at home while staying at the hotel and would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to Chicago  It is right around the corner from the Magnificent Mile and I have great views from my room It was a little pricy thought came out to around  a night with all of the taxes  
P => Excellent Hotel Choice Hi We stayed here   and     We had got a deal on Priceline  for   a night  We were on the th floor with a great view of Navy Pier  When we checked in they said they were going to give us an upgraded room they did not say why  The room was very large  It had a large dresser king size bed desk and lounging chair  The linens and pillows were soft and a perfect end to long days of sightseeing  Bathroom was large it had a tub and a erate glass stand up shower  Great air conditioning system   I think they should provide complimentary breakfast   Only complaint was that our headboard was on the wall of the elevator which as you can imagine was not the best room to have  So be warned it is a large hotel ask for a room AWAY from the elevator  Great location a couple blocks from Magificient Mile   I would absolutely stay here again 
P => Quiet and comfortable bed Stayed at the Swisshotel       for  USD a nite plus taxes from Priceline  What a deal The hotel is truly a   with large rooms large bled bathrooms that come with shower and tub  Shower pressure was very good  Robes were provided in the closet  King size bed with nice soft linens and pillows  A desk and internet hook up was in the room  Minibar and TV  Cost of internet was day  Air conditioned We were on the st floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan Grant Park and Lakeshore Drive  Hotel is walking distance  mins to the Magnificant Mile for all the serious shoppers this is your street of dreams and Navy Pier in the other direction  Closest subway station is a good  minute walk so prepare for some walking to get to public transportation  Taxi are available at the hotel  No complimentary breakfast was provided Hotel is staff is courteous on the most part  The head concierge Dan seemed a little short at times but aside from him everyone else was quite helpful Definitely would stay again  
P => Within walking distance       Stay at the Swissotel      Based on some of the reviews I was concerned that the hotel was old and far from the attractions that brought us to Chicago  If you are healthy and can walk its the way to see the city and the beautifull buildings and parks  We walked everywhere  My wife is  and I am  so we are not spring chickens  So strap on your walking shoes and get outside to enjoy the sites of this beautiful city   See Grant Park Eat Chicago Pizza and if your a beer drinker you have to try Goose Ale  Have fun in Chicago 
P => The good and the so so Just returned from a three night stay at the Swissotel  I had read online about the corner room and possible upgrades so I asked if a corner room was possible  I didnt get it for free   it was offered at   a night and the hotel was pretty full so we took that  We didnt check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a quotnormalquot room and loved it and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest theyd been in lately  We took the corner room facing Navy Pier and Chicago River and we were high fiving for  minutes like kids in a candy shop  Two walls are solid glass the entire wall  The view was unparralled  The bed was PERFECT  Two plump down pillows for each of us big fluffy white comforter soft sheets CLEAN  There were thick terry robes in the closet an umbrella you could borrow iron coffee pot lotions and q tips all complimentary  The front desk staff was professional and very helpful  My only complaint was that there is a charge for using the gym that is not stated very clearly and openly and I was shocked that it was to be added to my bill without my knowledge  I resorted to only using the sauna after talking to management about the fee and suddenly the next day quotthe sauna was being worked on for several hoursquot and I could not use it  Swissotel has a famous restaurant inside it and the staff in there are charming and attentive  Loved them I wasnt completely bowled over by the Swiss as they could have done a little more to really make our stay special paper delivered only once to door no extra ammenities or special touches that would really impress for very little extra cost  Make SURE to walk just behind the hotel to Millenium Park  Its RIGHT THERE Theres a nice cafe and sculptures and music  In front of the Millenium Park is a Starbucks and a Walgreens since you cant use your in room frige without paying out the woo hoo  Very cool hotel  Loved it  View makes it 
P => Loved the Swissotel I stayed here back in ember   Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile  I had a great room overfacing the Chicago River  Will stay here verytime I go to Chicago  
P => Good value and location Booked on Hotwire for less than  taxes included per night  Stayed one night   Purpose of the trip was to shop eat and see Pearl Jam in concert at the United Center  Location was good for shopping since it is a three block walk to the south end of the Magnificent Mile  The cab fare to and from the hotel to the United Center was approx  each way Valet parking was  plus tip for one night  We checked in at  p m   minutes early  A river view room was ready  The room was clean  The room included a big umbrella which proved useful given the weather that afternoon We had drinks at The Palm lobby bar in the hotel bar before the concert  Service was good  Cigar smoking patrons didnt add to the atmosphere though Ate at Rosebud for lunch  It is roughly   blocks from the hotel  What an EXCELLENT surprise  We walked in off the street in part because we were starved and because of the weather  We could not have picked a better place for lunch  The lunch entrees we picked were    Lunch for two with house wine coffee dessert and tip was about   The Italian food was superb  Talk about a tasty quotgravyquot  My wife and I are food snobs and this place really was a treat My only complaint about the hotel was the ice machines  There was no ice machine on our floor  I had to go one floor up or down for ice  I went up and that machine was broken  No big deal other then it took fifteen minutes to find ice at midnight Six months ago we stayed three nights at the Westin Mag  Mile for over twice the price per night  I would definitely chose Swissotel over many others if you can get a good rate  
P => Fantastic We absolutely loved the hotel  Had a corner room with views of the lakeNavy Pier one way and downtown the other Amazing view  Staff were courteous  The concierge did a great job with dinner recommendations  It is a easy walk or cab ride to all down town attractions  Anyone who says Michigan Ave is too far away is just plain lazy its  blocks  One block walk to Millenium Park  The closest quotElquot station was about a  minute walk  Only downside is parking was a bit expensive but then most city hotels are  
P => Memorial Day Weekend in Chicago Pros Location  walking distance from StateLake Orange Line stop if you have more than one bag you might prefer a cab with a good pair of walking shoes and if you luck out and get great weather as I did you can walk the entire Magnificent Mile though if youre power shopping you  want to stay at one of the hotels nearon the Mag  Mile so you can drop packages off  We found State St  stores more in our middle class price range and closer to Swissotel  easy walk to Millienium Park Art Institute and State Street shopping walking distance to Navy Pier  Chicago Arch  Center boat tours leave just across the street from hotel at riverside  Im from Los Angeles and dont do a lot of walking but I found all of the above within my comfort zone  Cabs were parked outside in case I got lazy  Cons I believe the hotel is categorized in the luxury category but seemed pretty plain wrap to me  Room and bathroom were clean though shower stall was extremely tiny and Im not that big  There was no room to put shampoo and if you put it on the floor and bent over you chanced hitting your head on the door  You had to turn the water on while standing in the stall or it would spray directly into the room before you had a chance to shut the door  There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water  One day there was a newspaper but not the other three days we were there  Staff seemed efficient though not overly friendly no good morning etc  when you passed  Room service is limited after  p m  Though not completely isolated I didnt find any interesting restaurants nearby  The Swissotel loyalty program is by invitation only which was disappointing  I recently joined the Fairmonts free Presidents Club and enjoyed benefits such as free wireless access free health club and spa discount my very first visit  As far as activities in Chicago did the usual tourist stuff  Found the John Hancock Observatory to be expensive for the short time ones there  Instead of spending money for it have a drink in the Signature Lounge or enjoy the reasonably priced lunch buffet offered in the Signature Room instead  Took in the Best of Second City at the Black Orchid Lounge  got the tickets at discount at the HotTix at the Old Water Tower building  Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery traditional deli pizza chocolate lounge etc  with informative details about Chicagos history  Our guide Shane pointed out significant buildings that we would have walked right past and introduced us to some wonderful neighborhoods that offered shops and restaurants unique to Chicago  The tour covers several miles so wear comfortable shoes and carry a tote to hold all the stuff youre going to want to buy  or better yet ask Shane about his Hammock Bag  it holds a ton and you wont even feel that youre wearing it  
P => Wonderful hotel I am a frequent visitor to Chicago and I found this hotel to be excellent in almost every way  MUCH better than some less quotimpressivequot properties and it was less expensive as well though I found a special rate online Swissotel offered all the servicesextras I like    lots of cabs in hotel bar great views room service etc  Extremely helpful staff a very quiet clean and safe property As for people that have complained about the proximity to attractions    we didnt find that to be true at all    a quick  minute walk and you are on Michigan Ave  Plenty of restaurantsshopsetc nearby and easy access to everything  Of course   it is not like Rush Street but then again   stay on Rush if that is what you desire One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge  per  hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms  In this day and age   I think free wireless should be a given  
P => Liked the place but were annoyed by a couple of things Last month my boyfriend and I stayed at Swissotel which I bought through HotWire for  including tax and everything  My first impression is not so good for when we drove up to the entrance and tried to park there just for a couple of minutes to check inwe had a plan to drive somewhere so we didnt want to put our car in their parking  One guyI think he was a porter or quotparking solicitatorquot if that exists came up to us and yelled at us  quotDont park here hurry up hurry upquot Excuse me We your customers have just arrived here to stay at your hotel  And we are just trying to check in and get out of here as soon as possible  Please give us a break My boyfriend tried to explain our situation but the guy continued to yell at us quotHurry up Hurry upquot So our first impression of the hotel was REALLY bad By the way since we heard that their valet parking costs around  a night we parked in the millennium park garage which is located four or five blocks from the hotel  We entered the garage around pm and left it around pm on the following day and ended up paying   I dont know if thats a good ision but I kind of suspect that we might have paid more than a day charge if we asked the hotel for the valet parking Swissotel is located two or three blocks from Michigan Ave  where there is no walgreen or other small stores  You have to walk up kind of boring side of Wacker for a couple of blocks so if you want to do a small shoppinglike a chips and waters you should do it before leaving Michigan Our non smoking room was very nice not too much orated but not too business like  It didnt have any stinky or smoky smell  It had a gorgeous view of the skyscraper and a partial view of the lake which gave our nerve a rest  The bath room was really beautiful and big with a small shower cell AND the tub arately  be in winter you would love to take a long hot bath  The king size bed was very comfortable if you prefer a bit firmer mattress  The amenity is pretty good with common bath productsincluding bath gel and coffee makerwith free coffees amp teas  The only thing that we hated in the room was the fridge  It was super tiny and did not allow you to put anything yours  The sign on the fridge said something like quotif you move drinks inside that would be automatically added to your bill quot So even if you have some leftovers from a pizza place or rib place you cannot put it in the fridge  And waters and everything inside the room were SOOO overpriced  I strongly suggest you be aware of that Our stay had another twist  We found a TV remote in our room broken  It might not be a big deal for some people but if you lie down on the king bed and relax yourself by watching TV that becomes a big deal  So we asked the frontdesk to fix it and they sent an engineer  Well   fixing the malfunctioning remote ended up taking our supposedly comfortable   hour  The engineer did his best to fix it but the remote never worked  At some point we began to murmur quotwell if you cannot fix it   quot   and of course the hotel ided to make up for us they changed our room  So after the hardworking engineers   hour struggle we were asked to move to the next room   Our next room was also non smoking  Then we were told that rooms on the top  or  floors are all non smoking They apologized their inconvenience and offered us a free breakfast which by the way was great with various kinds of fruits cereals and bread and we really appreciated In the end our impression is kind of mixed the porteror parking solicitator was really rude and annoyed us but the room somehow compensated for it then the trouble bothered our stay A LOT but was made up for with their sincere apology and a great breakfast  I have stayed in Lenoxcurrently under reation Allegro and Fourpoints by Sheraton before  The size wise be Swissotel is the best and then comes Fourpoints  The convenience wise Fourpoints definitely beats Swissotel Fourpoints has a small fridge in which you can put anything and even offers a free bottle of water as a welcome gift  Also people at Fourpoints were far nicer friendlier and warmer than ones at SwissotelYou can easily chat with anyone at Fourpoints but not with ones at Swissotel  But the luxury wise Swissotel looks fancier and can make your day a bit different  We might end up staying there again but rather want to try different hotels next time  
P => Highly recommend the Swissotel My husband and I spent this past Thursday and Friday nights at the Swissotel  We were very pleased with the hotel and with the service  We had a standard room the first night  It was large and comfortable  The next day we were out walking for hours and returned to our room at  p m  hoping to relax  The room had not been serviced and we were not pleased  The front desk offered to have housekeeping come right up but we were not interested in leaving the room again  They offered us a free upgrade to a corner room  The views on all sides were spectacular  We didnt use the fitness center or pool but they are beautiful  Ive posted one picture of the view from the standard room and the rest are pictures of the corner room  We will definitely stay at the Swiss again  
P => Beautiful Room Exceptional Staff We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for  unbelievable rate and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel  The staff was so polite and catered to our every need  The room was oversized clean and had a large bathroom  We had a partial view of Lake Michigan which was an added bonus  On the nd floor they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from  sides  Spectacular We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier  We cant wait to go to the Swissotel again 
P => Had a good time    Prior to booking this hotel on Hotwire I read some pretty bad reviews of it here first  I didnt experience any problems that people here complained about  I got it on Hotwire for  which is an absolute steal given its location  off season but still a steal  the retail rate was listed as about double  There are two reviews on the Hotwire site that make it obvious that it is most likely the Swissotel  One person says they got a lake view the other says a river view  Very very few hotels be  other in Chicago have both a Lake and River view  We found the desk staff to be very friendly  We even asked and got a PM late check out  She did say that their occupancy rate when we were there was   which could explain why they werent reluctant The ammenities on Hotwiare at the time were listed as Tennis nearby Spa Pool Restaraunt etc   There is no actual Spa its just a service they make an appointment with and they come to the hotel  so the services are overpriced  The upstairs workout room looked nice and the pool looked OK though there was a maintenance guy reapplying some tiles to the wall while we contemplated swimming The room itself was MUCH nicer than I thought it looked in the pictures  The furniture wasnt dingy like others complained  And the bathroom was nice with a erate shower and ent sized tub not jacuzzi but a little larger than normal  Room service was efficient average priced and ent food  In room mini bar was average priced as well  Bed and linens were very comfortable Ignore anyone who complains the valet parking is expensive  they obviously havent parked in downtown Chicago too much  The parking rates at the Swissotel are right on par with what they are anywhere else in downtown Chicago in fact some other hotels charge more  
P => Can get ent deals on a nice hotel I booked this room on hotwire for about   The hotel was very nice rooms were big the poolhot tub area was very nice and the location was great and easy to get to  The only negative is the parking situation which costs  for valet without many options  We parked in a public parking site nearby on Wacker and it only cost  for the night  I would recommend staying at this hotel if you get a chance  
P => A great value great location We booked our weekend stay on Price line with a night rate  We stayed on the rd floor with wonderful views  It is true that the rooms have a little wear but not to the point of being a problem  The bed was very comfortable and room very quiet  The Swissotel is only two blocks from Michigan Ave  blocks from Millenium Park and really an ideal location for most activities  
P => Average far better places to stay We stayed here for  nights we thought we had booked in the Sofitel which is great but due to a mix up ended up here  First impressions are that the hotel is pretty tired and cold do with a refurb  Rooms are dated our corner rooms bathroom was shabby  When I discovered my door didnt stay shut I noticed this on day  the engineer fixed the problem but then keys wouldnt function  Parking was expensive  for a couple of hours the concierge had gone home pm on Saturday  The location was adequate but there are far better places for the money  Cant recommend this Im afraid  
P => Great Hotel Very Friendly Staff I stayed at the Swissotel with four friends for one night on a weekend trip to Chicago  We got a great deal on Hotwire so the value for what we paid was incredible  At check in the front desk staff member wasnt overly friendly but certainly wasnt rude  We were greeted each time we entered and left and always offered a cab if needed  The room was a little small for the furnishings but the view was incredible and the beds were exceptionally comfortable  I ordered room service late on Saturday night and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago He was swift polite and extremely well mannered  I didnt order anything fancy pizza amp beer but the beer was cold and the pizza was ent  The hotel is located a few blocks out of the way of Michigan Avenue and the nearest train station but it was located right on the water which offered some incredible views of Lake Michigan and the canal  If youre not a fan of walking plan on taking the cab or find somewhere else to stay  Otherwise I highly recommend the Swissotel I didnt mind the walk at all though since I was too busy being enamored by the city 
P => Great deal on Priceline My husband and I ided on a spontaneous overnight during the holiday break so we pricelined a hotel and ended up at the Swissotel  Weve used priceline for almost every trip to Chicago and I would say that the Swissotel is in line with the quality of the other hotels weve stayed in  For   a night it was a great deal  The hotel has a good location and a great view of the river  The best feature of the hotel however in my opinion is its beds  They were really comfortable  Priceline describes the hotel as  star   Id give it  stars due to the fact that it is starting to show some age  The bathroom and the furniture in our room could have used some attention  Overall it is a nice hotel especially if you can get a good deal  
P => A secret hotel that might surprise you I stayed in the hotel for four nights and truly enjoyed my time  Although my key card always malfunctioned  problem they promised they were addressing the service was top notch It is off the beaten path somewhat but only a five minute walk to Michigan Avenue and Wacker  It is about a eight minute walk to the L at State and Lake  Not terrible  Great location to the business downtown area and the banks    Would suggest for business travel or leisure travel looking for some a great quiet hotel     Very nice pool and fitness center great locker rooms    Great onsite restaurant    Elevators were NOT slow as suggested    Billing for parking is expensive    Be aware of the fridge   they charge you for looking at the items if you move a product you are charged although they took it off my bill it was the one time the staff was crankyWill plan to stay there in future visits to city  
P => Swissotel Was Awesome We stayed at the swissotel for our th anniversary  We got a corner room with both a lake and city view  The room was very clean and spacious  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  We asked for late checkout and was told no problem  If you bring your car park in millinum parking it is just  blocks away  The cost there is   compared to the swissotel which is    
P => Very nice The Swissotel Chicago is an excellent hotel  Got a room on Hotwire for   taxes total   Usually all I care about in a hotel is the bed and their bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in a hotel  The room was big and the bath and shower were arate  Its in a great location right next to Millenium Park  I would always park at the Millenium parking garage where its   day compared to day for the valet parking  Had some friends at the Hyatt which is right next to the Swissotel and they had to wait  minutes to get their car out of the valet  
P => Swissotel package was a fine value We spent last weekend at the Swissotel and were delighted with the service the views and the amenities  We purchased a package which included wine and cheese upon arrival two breakfast buffets for the next morning and a reduced price for parking  The wine and cheese tray was outstanding  It included a very nice variety of fruit and cheeses including Brie and it even had dried icots and carmelized walnuts  Our room was spacious and included two comfortable swivel desk chairs in addition to the easy chair with ottoman  After returning from the pool and spa on the nd floor we moved the desk chairs in front of our window put our feet up on the ledge and enjoyed the Navy Pier fireworks display from the comfort of our room  The maid who had provided turn down service had also turned on the radio so quotTake Fivequot accompanied the fireworks  It was GREAT The next morning we were extremely pleased with the variety and quality of the breakfast buffet  After breakfast we walked the two blocks to Millenium Park  The total cost for the package with tax and parking was   We thought it was a wonderful value and we intend to return  
P => Swissotel was Awesome Beautiful Hotel right on the water  The late night walks cant be beat  Very close to everything  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  Will be going back and staying here  
P => A Winner Once Again This is the second time in yrs I have stayed here first trip as a lone female and I returned home yesterday having spent a week with my yr old wheelchairbound Mother in this delightful spot The hotel staff were great always on hand to help  The wheelchair accessible room was excellent with terrific views over the lake  The weather was mid to upper s for the whole week but I love Chicago any time of year  We stayed in another downtown hotel in  of this year but the Swiss wins The room was spacious and very very clean  Even on busy Labor Day weekend there was always room in the elevators and lobby  I will certainly be returning     with or without MOM 
P => Home away from home Have stayed here at least   times in the last  years  One of our favorite city hotels  Great views bathrooms  in the executive suites and room service  Never had a problem with any service personnel About  paces to the stores on the magnificent mile but the quality of the hotel makes the slightly longer walk more than acceptable  word to the wise  avoid the rooms ending with  The headboards back up to the high speed elevator shafts and you here whizzing all night  
P => Good VISTA    min walk to Magnificent Mile I liked its location  To know the city it is best to look over the city once or twice while visiting  And I recommend this to the tourists although the setting is to impress the business travelers equally I remember the staff were friendly to us during our visit  The room was not   clean but it was acceptable and I did not complain as the view from the room just compensated all other minor problmes I might have overlooked Chicago is a Windy City and you will definitely feel IT while you get inout of the hotel  it is a bit of walk to the loop trains or closest bus stop will be still  min walk  chillingThe location is good as it was close to the Millenium Park and there is one huge construction going on next to the hotel but it did not bother us at all as there was no big noisedust coming from it  As Swissotel say in their website this will be their best rated hotel and it did not disappoint me at all  So my verdict is  out of   
P => Loved the Swissotel My husband and I just stayed at the Swissotel for  nights  We got it for  a night off of Hotwire and they put us on the th floor with a great view  Check in and check out were very easy  The parking is expensive at  a night so we took the advise from people on the Chicago forum and parked at the Millenium Park garage for only  a night  It was only a  minute walk away  Michigan Ave  is very close and Navy Pier is a  min  walk away or a  cab ride for  people   The pool and hottub on the nd floor was awesome Such a great view and very relaxing after a long day of walking  It closes already at pm though   The bathroom was very impressive with ble tile and arate shower and bathtub   Overall a very good stay We would definitely recommend the Swissotel 
P => Very comfortable   great stay Just spent  nights at the Swissotel in Chicago on a business trip  The room was big clean and had a great view of Navy Pier  The bed was just perfect  I slept well on both nights The Palms restaurant in the hotel is one of the top rated steak houses in Chicago  I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is the lobby smelt like a bad ashtray  On the other hand the room was fine and had no such problems  
P => Good Choice I stayed in Swissotel Chicago for five nights in y of  due to an international conference in Chicago  I stayed with a special rate in Swiss   per night before tax   only accommodation  Some conference participants stayed in Fairmoth and some others stayed in Hyatt Hotel  Swiss and Hyatt have great locations and very near to Madison Avenue stations of city bus tours and boat rides for canal  Hyatt Hotel seemed to me like a  human factory  due to massive conference groups  Most of the time I found myself in the river of the crowds in Hyatt  In this matter Swiss seemed to me much better  Even if it is not completely immuneOn the positive side my room was very spacious partly with canal view  seeing partly another building Well maintained room with working table big TV large closet iron set  The bathroom was spacious large bles with a big shower section  Housekeeping was wonderful  Elevators are very quick On the negative side I was disappointed with the breakfast section  It seemed to me pretty small for such a big hotel  Very crowded  So I went out for the breakfast after the first try  In terms of concierge in Swissotel do not expect too much Frankly Hyatt s concierge seemed to me more efficient and helpful  Referring to the Reception some guys seemed to me helpful  However I requested a wake up call for a very early flight to New York but they somehow forgot to set this wake up call  Therefore when you need a wake up call set your own mobile phone alarm as I did just to be on the safe side Madison Avenue is beautiful  We tried Grand Luxury Caf   Very good ambience  What a city  I definitely put Chicago to my favorite cities in US together with NY and San Francisco  Overall I am very pleased with my stay in Swissotel in Chicago  And I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends in my circle  When I booked Swissotel Chicago I relied on the positive comments from other tripadvisor users  Thanks for all your feedback and comments  
P => Send it back to Switzerland The location is good  The hotel can use some updating worn carpets bathroom tiles etc   The staff is quite unfriendly and unaccomodating You will get nickel and dimed in this place for every little thing  The hotels motto is experience some quotSwiss Hospitalityquot if thats the case I will never visit Switzerland  
P => Great Views Rooms were clean good sized and great views of Navy Pier  Large bathroom with erate shower and bath  Newspaper left outside door in the morning  They also have an indoor pool and weight room on nd fl Check in was quick  I arrived early and was able to check in at  AM tooI only ate breakfast in the hotel  They have a buffett that is nothing special Service was adequate  They do cater to European guests  Concierge helpful with directions and trains    min walk to trains and Michigan Ave shops One thing to take advantage of if you are flying out of Chicago is to have the front desk print out your boarding passes  SouthWest only allows you to print boarding passes after  AM the day of your flight so if you dont have a laptop and a portable printer you  be looking at   min wait at the airport to check in They were extremely helpful and had it ready for me as I checked out  
P => Excellent Hotel We booked this hotel very last minute by looking up the Yellow Pages in Chicago  We were given a beautiful room over looking the river  The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly and couldnt have done more for us  The rooms were very clean and spacious  The hotel is very central within walking distance of all the major attractions in Chicago and I would definatly recommend this hotel for anyone to stay in  
P => Great modern rooms We stayed here for our wedding night because we wanted a lake or river view   we had to pay a little extra for that side of the hotel but got a view of both  Room was large and the sleek modern bath was great even with arate bath and shower  Bed was one of the nicest Ive ever slept in although I dont usually stay at this nice a hotel  
P => Great views otherwise disappointing We stayed at Swissotel over Memorial Day Weekend  While our lakeview room was spectacular overlooking the Chicago River where it meets Lake Michigan and Navy Pier I was very disappointed with the room and the service at this hotel  Furniture in room was beat up a handle missing from a dresser drawer a picture in the bathroom with mold growing on the mat inside the frame desk phone not working   I could go on but those were some of the problems we encountered  I also hated that there were no fitted sheets   woke up each morning sleeping right on the mattress as the sheets had come loose  As for service issues the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels despite a  tip that had been left I normally tip   per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid but I ided to try something different this time since we were at a   hotel  We had a voucher for a breakfast buffet that included tax amp gratuity but still left a  tip for the waiter when we returned the next day he put us in the back of the restaurant and pretty much forgot about us we removed our own dirty dishes and I finally got a refill on my coffee after asking another waiter while our waiter doted on a party of  without vouchers that was seated after us   they were immediately greeted with a thermal carafe of coffee while my cup sat empty     Needless to say we didnt tip him the second day  I should note that we had booked a quotbed amp breakfastquot special that had been promoted on Travelzoo   while the value was very good for a downtown hotel especially given the added breakfast I didnt feel like I truly experienced a   hotel despite my best efforts to be an appreciative guest  Yes the room view was teriffic but I paid extra for a lake view room  I would probably stay here again if I found a similar deal  All in all I feel like this hotel has   potential but is probably in need of a reation and some intense customer service training for its staff  I honestly expected more from a hotel of this caliber and left wondering if I had been treated differently because of the price I paid  
P => Cant beat the views Stayed at Swissotel for Memorial Day weekend and couldnt have enjoyed it more Without question the main draw is a fantastic view of the river and lake  Had a north corner deluxe room with a view of Wrigley Building and Michigan Avenue out one side and a panorama of the lakefront from Navy Pier to the Chicago River and Lake Shore Drive on the other including the bathroom windows  There is no better view in ChicagoStaff was courteous without being quotover the topquot and was responsive to all requests  Lack of a room safe was noted but safe deposit boxes at front desk are easy to use The only negative would be that beds are sufficient but not exceptional  If youre looking for beds like the W or Westin Swissotel doesnt have it  Then again the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it Good location with an easy walk to Michigan Ave and an El stop about  blocks away  You cant go wrong here 
P => Swissotel was incredible The best service The staff here was incredible  You never had to lift a finger  The room was huge as hotel rooms go  The view was phenomenal  Location great  What a great weekend  We did stop for a drink at the Palm Restaurant and unfortunately it closes at  p m  Too bad The Lobby Lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the Palm  
P => Fantastic views We stayed in the Swissotel for a weekend getaway and loved the experience  We had a standard room which was larger than I expected  There was a comfortable lounge chair and desk with two chairs which could double as a small dining table  The bath was ble with both a shower and a tub  The view from our room was fantastic  We could see all the way down Lake Shore drive to the Aquarium The staff was very friendly and helpful  One nice feature is the lounge bar which also functions as a small coffee bar A great experience  
P => a great location We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nightsa wonderful place Room was on the th floorabsolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview Breakfast perfect and service really good People were always helpful Its a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loopbut in front of the hotel there are buses numberwaiting there next turnnot a real bus stopbut drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel  
P => loved our stay at the swissotel    beware the parking garage My husband and I just stayed at the Swissotel for the first time il th  for  night  Beautiful hotel with great service and location  We live in the suburbs and drove to the city for our stay  Parking is expensive at   per night  that wouldnt have been so bad but after leaving the hotel and driving a short distance we realized our full tank of gas had been siphoned  We called the hotel and learned that anyone can get into the parking garage   that there isnt an attendent on duty  They took some information from us but we never got the feeling that anything was going to be done as far as compensation  Beware if you park your car there  
P => Classy interesting and sharp hotel Stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it  Very attractive classy and comfortable hotel thats got an element of sexy and sharp  Public spaces are very nice with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas  Rooms are lovely as well with handsome fixtures and furniture a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed  Bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well  Best of all the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water   both the river and the lake  If youre working in the area its the best choice for that part of town and I prefer it to the nearby Hyatt and Monaco  
P => Luxury for less in the heart of the Windy City Ive scored this  star beauty on Hotwire for  a night on two different occasions  The location is PERFECT for exploring the Magnificent Mile area up and down Michigan Avenue  We walked to dinner one night and down to the Hancock Tower one morning  You can also walk to the Navy Pier and you have great views of either the downtown skyline or Lake Michigan depending on which side of the triangular building your room is on  Rooms were very comfortable and spacious with nice furniture comfy bed luxurious bathroom great TV etc  This is definitely a  star if not a  and a halfer As you might guess parking is expensive but I parked my rental car at the meters on Wacker drive because we came in in the evening and the street parking was free after pm  The next morning I filled the meters while we lounged around the hotel before leaving for the day Hotwire lists this hotel as a  star on Wacker drive and the Hyatt which is next store is also often available thru Hotwire  Both are great deals for being in the heart of one of Americas coolest cities  
P => Great Find I loved it here My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our  nights here  Ive paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel  Gorgeous hotel great staff fun barlounge area and we were most impressed with the room  The large windows in the bathroom were the best  I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline  I remember thinking quotThis is really living   quot The room was comfortable and quiet again with great views just like in the bathroom  Chicago is a wonderful town  I have nothing but good things to say about it  CAnt wait to come back 
P => Great Price on Priceline We recently went to Chicago for St  Patricks Day with some friends  I took a gamble and booked through Priceline for a  star hotel and I got the Swissotel for   We just had a short walk down Wacker to Michigan Ave  which was perfect  The hotel was very nice great bathroom comfy bed etc  We were basically next to the Hyatt which has a spectacular bar  
P => Service needs improvement This is a great hotel with no customer service focus  It amazes me that a hotel of this caliber does not understand customer service  I was asked to leave the health club at closing time    something no other hotel I have ever stayed at has done  It didnt matter to the attendant that I was in the middle of my treadmill run  Most hotels Ive stayed at allow guests to be in the health club at any hour although an attendant is not always available  Also room service told me that I could not order scrambled eggs because it was after  AM  Yes this is a stated policy however Ive never stayed at another hotel that wont serve such a simple dish at any hour since it is not a big deal to do so  Very disappointing from a service perspective  The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants but that was not the case either    other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food  On the plus side the room was a nice size the hotel was relatively quiet the bed was of excellent quality and the view of the lake is outstanding  Just dont ask anyone to provide you with outstanding service 
P => Nice hotel but overpriced I stayed at the Swissotel ch th   It was very nice and had a great view of the lake and the Chicago River  The room was not huge and needed a little updating  I expected a little more for such an expensive hotel  As with all downtown hotels you pay a lot of money and get very little in return  Everyone has their hand out for a tip for any little thing they do  My biggest complaint is that their parking was  per night and the guys who get your car want a tip for taking your car and for bringing it back to you  We went to nearby Navy Pier and the parking was a flat   So for less than a  hour period I paid  to park plus tips  Its not worth it  
P => Excellent hotel Stayed here for one night in ruary   The hotel is situated in a business y area w many other hotels although Magnificent Mile is win easy walk be a  minute walk away  However theres not much for nightlife other than the hotel restaraunts and bars very close by although we walked to an area w plenty of bars about a  minute walk and only a  cab ride back  The room was very nice very clean  The bathroom was also very nice and very clean  The hotel was very quiet  Overall I was extremely pleased  We got a great deal on Hotwire only  per night   I think a hotel like this would easily be  per night in NYC or Boston  
P => Fantastic Views The Swissotel is one of the tallest hotels in Chicago and it provides fantastic views of the city the lake and Navy Pier  Its located right on the Chicago River directly south of the river at the east end near the lake  Its over  floors glass exterior with a triangular shape  A large oversized revolving door serves as the entrance way to the lobby which is quite large and impressive  Theres a nice sized gift shop with everything from magazines to drinks and chocolates pretty much your standard convenience store  Theres an escalator that goes into the basement where youll find a nice upscale restaurant and a long walkwayconcourse that leads to an underground mini mall with a grocery store fast food restaurants barber shop etc  Back to the lobby  the staff is very professional and friendly and they go out of their way to make your stay comfortable  We were really impressed with how smooth check in went and how helpful the clerk was  Each floors elevator lobby has huge windows overlooking the lake and Navy Pier and you can take a look at the spectacular view right there before you head to your room  Theres also an indoor pool large excercize room and spacious mens and womens locker rooms on the top floor with floor to ceiling windows all around you  The views up there are incredible theres really no other hotel in Chicago with better views  The rooms are not all that big  They seem spacious and well appointed and the fact that the entire wall was a window definitely made up for the fact that the room was on the small side  Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless and beautifully designed  The only downside of this hotel is its location  The location itself near Navy Pier and the lake isnt a problem but if you dont have a car youll be doing a lot of walking since the hotel is located at the end of an upper level street that just drops off  youll have to do a lot of walking around and over bridges  On a side note at the end of the street where it drops off the road loops around and serves as a curb side parking lot with meters  a quarter for  min  but its free on Sundays so if youre lucky enough to find a space on Sunday its free and convenient Its about a  minute walk to Navy Pier and a couple blocks east of Michigan Ave and there is no public transportation or El stop nearby  Nearest El stop is on the corner of State and Lake which is another  minute walk  Again the location is fine if you plan on walking a lot or dont mind taking taxis everywhere but there are many hotels along Michigan Avenue or State Street or right next to an El stop  Its a little away from the action but the views are fantastic  
P => Clean comfortable and friendly My mom and I stayed at The Swissotel in ober of this year and had a great experience there  I searched this sight long and hard for a good place to stay in Chicago and was not disappointed I normally dont stay at places this pricey due to budgetary constraints but got a good deal at the hotels web site  The room was clean our beds with down pillows and duvets were comfortble and the staff was friendly and helpful   everyone from the bellmen to the concierge to the business center staff  Additionally the view from our room Chicago River Lake Michigan and Navy Pier was excellent despite the construction going on outside the building  My reason for not giving this hotel an quotExcllentquot review is its location  While the location is not bad its on the south shore of the Chicago River meaning its a few block walk or cab ride from the main shoppingsightseeing district on Michigan Avenue  I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Wow  Great View Very very comfortable bed  We stayed their only on night and then moved to Lennox Suites which sucked in comparison  I really did not have to deal with the staff too much we asked for extra pillows and towels and they were brought right away and check in was easy  
P => I wouldnt stay anywhere else  My husband and I regularly stay here for our anniversary which always falls on the weekend of the th and during the Taste of Chicago  I have always used Quickbook and book the Executive floor with a king bed  non smoking floors  and above  I have never had to request a lakeview and have always gotten one with a great view  In fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks   We both take advantage of the free self serve bar wine and liquor mixed drinks and comp hot and cold hourderves cordial and desert hour on the weekends and great breakfast nibbles incl smoked salmon trout and cheeses and real squeezed juices in the executive lounge  all comes with the executive level booking  I woudnt pass up spending the extra on the E level if you take advantage of the perks it more than makes up for the cost  The free health club with the saunas and full window showers overlooking the river are wonderful after a long day walking around Chicago  The museums are a ent walk and if you get tired they do have free trolley and the busses are cheap and come by every min Location cant be beat close to major attractions easy cab ride to ones farther away  The rooms are spacious and Ive never had any problems with noise  they are much quieter than other hotels Ive been at  The bathroom is something I want in my house All in all this is the place to stay 
P => Good deal I was able to get a room on the d floor with a fantastic southeast view of the Drive Field Museum and parts of Millenium Park  All this for  through Quikbook  Service was friendly and courteous  The room was clean and large including a big stuffed chair a desk two desk chairs good sized closet and dresser  The bathroom was also large bath and shower all nicely tiled  It is not a four star hotel  I dont know what full fare is at this hotel but there is a deal available and you can get above the th floor its a great hotel for  bucks  
P => Great Hotel My husband and I booked this Hotel through Hotwire without knowing what hotel we were getting and were just a little nervous  We were pleasantly surprised The location great and a short walk to Michigan Ave  The room was clean and stocked with toiletries and plenty of towels  They even provide an umbrella for your use  The beds were cozy with a down comforter and pillows  There is even an extra comforter and blanket in the closet  We were on the rd floor and had a great view of the navy pier  My only complaint would be that they elevators are slow and we had to wait a while at times  Otherwise it was a wonderful experience  
P => Great View but that was about it    The GoodGreat location  Stayed on the th floor facing the lake river and Navy Pier  Wonderful view especially on Saturday night when the pier had fireworks The BadCONSTANT elevator noiseLoose carpetingShower leaked all over floorHigh pitched tone from air conditioner maddeningStaff not very helpful or friendlyOverall a so so experience will not stay there again  
P => Perfect I recently stayed at this hotel with my family       We had a terrific experience  I landed the hotel through Priceline for  per night and paid an additional  per night for a suite on the st floor  My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the nd floor was easily accessible  I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating  I would love to stay here again  
P => A wonderful stay Got a great deal on Priceline for  a night  The views were amazing the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever I had a question  Chicago is a walking city but if you are not a walker I would suggest looking for something in the Mag Mile although youll probably pay more  We go to NYC a lot so we dont mind walking Would definitely stay again 
P => Disappointing   This Hotel is Way Overpriced I booked a room in the Swissotel for my boyfriends birthday requesting a lakeview room and expecting to stay in a nice room with an impressive view  You would think that when booking a room in a prestigious hotel such as the Swissotel youd get your moneys worth  This is not so  Ive stayed in cheap motels with better looking or than in this VERY PLAIN VERY UNAPPEALING room  I am the kind who pays extra for that touch of stylish ambience and I got none of that here  While I admit that the beds were very comfortable the room was spacious and the bathroom the biggest Ive seen so far in my hotel going experience I was amazed at how utterly commonplace and practically ugly the furniture carpeting and wallpaper was  The lobby is particularly unimpressive too   especially the hideously outdated carpet  The other thing   the purportedly fantastic view is not that great  There was construction going on outside of the hotel while we stayed so that was not a particularly enthralling sight   but even we werent in the midst of construction I dont think the view would be anything spectacular  Also the toilet barely worked  It got rather disgusting as we had problems flushing  I was expecting a wonderful stay at a great hotel and what I got was an AVERAGE room in a clearly OVERPRICED hotel  
P => Excellent predictable We had a very pleasant stay at the Swissotel  It is in an excellent location close to Navy Pier Michigan Ave  and Millenium Park all within easy walking distance  My wife and I felt very safe after dark walking from Navy Pier to the hotel  The bed was very comfortable the room was quite large and quiet with a nice view  It is not an extravagant hotel such as the Ritz Carlton but nonetheless very appealing One tip I did not want to pay the ridiculous  valet parking for  hours so I parked in the Millenium Park garage for   and had a nice  minute walk through the park to the hotel but beware that the garage is underground and difficult to find  
P => A room with a view Oustanding Swissotel in Chicago was everything we expected and more  The Hotel itself is in a perfect location off the busy Michigan Ave  but only  blocks away  An easy quiet walk The view from our window was fabulous Looking over the new Millenium park and over to the lake  We even watched the fireworks at Navy pier from our window  I recommend this high class hotel with perfect service and will stay there again  
P => very pleasant surprise Chicago is a frequent destination for us  We love walking and shopping on the Magnificent Mile  Our first experience at the Swisshotel was superb  The views are fabulous the rooms clean and roomy  Service was european and elegant  The location is tops particularly if you want go North to shop or South to Millenium Park or the Loop  A great value in a luxury hotel  Well choose it again  
P => Niceotel Nice hotel  Great service nice view nice room  Its off the Mag Mile by a few blocks and the street is very empty after dark  Other than that its great  
P => Loved the Swissotel We stayed at this hotel in y   We loved it It was a gorgeous place   very clean   very acessible to everything in Chicago The conciege was very helpful   as was all of the staff  The lounge right off the lobby had great cappicino and yummy appetizers  I would highly recommend this hotel  Our room was lovely the beds were very comfy and the bedding was luxurious  Nice extras robes and aromatherapy toliletries were among extras offered  I would stay here again 
P => The service is fabulous My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service  Every person was polite attentive and helpful  We will stay there everytime we go to Chicago  Highly suggest staying there  
P => Lovely hotel Stayed for  days in y  Large clean rooms and comfortable bed  Large bathroom w shower amp tub  Fluffy bathrobes amp towels wide range of toilettries replenished daily  All employees were extremely courteous amp helpful  Checked in and out in seconds  Wall Street Journal delivered daily to your door  No noise great location fantastic views Only two negatives The nd floor pool so shallow you scrape your knees swimming jacuzzi doesnt work and the fitness equipment costs extra  The Palm restaurant had a  for two lobster promotion and though we specified it when making a reservation were told they were out of lobsters after being seated and the Shiraz tasted like housewine Would heartily recommend this hotel to all but eat amp excersize somewhere else 
P => Shiny urbanism at the Swissotel Go for a corner room   we stayed in one about half way up and the view was exceptional   looking up towards Grant Park and out onto the lake  This is a sleek property that verges on the impersonal   the nd floor pool is worth swimming in   if only for the view over the rooftops and showering afterwards looking out over the city is a pretty unbelievable experience  Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant a bit dark was of good quality  Service was good   efficient and polite  I think there are probably better value stays in similar hotels to be had in Chicago   this was expensive at  a night   but if youre after sleek treats I would go for it  Modernist urban pleasures 
P => Its all about the view My wife and I recently stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with our infant son  This is my favorite hotel in Chicago for two reasons   View and   Location  This hotel is only a  minute walk from Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River boat tours  You can also walk to Navy Pier in about  minutes from this hotel  By far the Swissotel Chicago offers a superior location  But my favorite thing about this hotel is the view  If you stay here opt for a corner room since it has a very unique triangular shape and will afford you a truly panoramic view  Our oversized room had a suberb view of the Chicago River Lake Michigan and Grant Park  We could see the fireworks at Navy Pier  You cant beat this kinda of a view  Despite the fact that this hotel is ideally designed for the business traveller they had plenty of amenities to accomodate our infant son  We were able to get a crib a play pen and a small room refrigerator for storing baby food at NO additional cost  Many other hotels charge up to  for baby amenities like a crib or a room refrigerator  These rooms are very speceous and the beds are very comfortable The hotel has the Palm restaurant which is ok but a bt overrated  This restaurant is within the hotel but seems to operate independantly so you cannot order room service from the Palm but you can get take out and then have platesutensils delivered from room srevice  The food at the Swissotel is better than the average hotel but nothing special  This is why I opt for  stars and not   One other downside is that there is no self parking at this hotel and valet parking costs a whopping  dollars which seems to be the going rate at all downtown Chicago hotels  If you want to self park you will have to find a nearby garage and walk to the hotel from there  There is a garage at the Hyatt Regency which is one block away  By the way all housekeeping and room service requests are handled promptly All in all the Swissotel is an excellent hotel in Chicago and we will continue to stay there during our future visits to Chicago  This is an excellent hotel for families and is very baby friendly  When you go be sure to opt for a corner room or a room with a view of Lake Michigan  Otherwise you might get a room that directly overlooks another office building  One additional tip I would offer is to call the hotels in house reservations department to make the booking  They have access to specials and packages that might not be on the Swissotel website  We got a  rate for a corner king room which included breakfast room service or at the Geneva Restaurant discounted parking at day and  tickets to the Field Museum  As I said before its all about the view  The best views in ChicagoP S  Please note that during our stay we noticed some construction taking place in the lot next to the Swissotel  It seems like there is another building going up  I am unsure that impact this will have on the view from the Swissotel  I would call the hotel directly to inquire  
P => Over Rated   Many Better Hotels in Chicago My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city  We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area  My opinion of the Swissotel   spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience  The Swissotel has a very cold atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable  The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average  The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel  Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more  Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at a which woke us up  We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk  We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel  They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register  He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment  Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment  Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service  Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area   
P => One of the best Stayed over a weekend in   Got the rate of night off of ebay  One the nicest hotels I have stayed at  Room was clean and comfortable  Robes were a nice touch  Bathrooms were large and clean  Only thing that was a pain was the walk up Wacker to get there from Michigan Ave  More of a hassle due to the cold weather  Probably not a problem during springsummer  
P => Loved it Great view from th floor of Navy Pier  Walking distance to Mag Mile and Pier  All staff were very helpful and friendly  We upgraded for  a night was well worth it  The pool and whirlpool were wonderful after all the walking we did  Parking was  a night but worth the convenience   
P => Loved this hotel We stayed here il   and loved everything about the hotel the staff and our room  We booked through Hotwire for a rate of  per night plus parking is  a day   would stay here again  
P => Overrated I wouldnt stay here beacuse its a cab ride to get anywhere  Chicago is a great walking town and this hotel is a little too far off Michigan ave to accomodate that  The rooms were nice and the view was pretty good  I think its a little too pricey compared to what you can get elsewhere on Michigan Ave  
P => One of Chicagos Best  Just stayed at the Swissotel for  nights and I have to say that my stay was a nice treat  I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to a lakefront view room upon a fast check in  It was my first time in this hotel so I didnt really know what to expect given the upgrade  On the way to the th floor I immediately noticed how well maintained the hotel was  The public spaces hallways the details were just polished and clean  Elevators were fast as well  The room I must say was great  It was very spacious immaculately clean and modern  The bed was very comfortable  The bathroom was all ble with arated shower and tub  And the view Just breathtaking  Thats when I realized why it was an upgrade  The view of the lake Navy pier Chicago river and even the Hancock building  all infront of you just accentuated my experience to another level  I would pay extra given the location of this room  I had many planned activities for this  night stay and I have to admit that I had a hard time leaving the room especially at night when the beauty of Chicago was just in front of you  I cannot comment on room services however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful  I have stayed in several Chicago hotels including  star properties but I have to say that for the value and amenities alone its hard to go wrong with the Swissotel   
P => Played with but rewarded I booked through Hotwire at a great rate  I had just come from the wyndham and was comfortable there but was very interested in the swiss as well  When we got there they had overbooked even though I also had confirmed weekly and even a few hours before our arrival the reservation and availability and I was VERY upset with them as they said they couldnt help me  I threatened and began to speak with others and demanded some help from some quotauthorityquot  I then was directed to a manager who gave us some quotmeeting roomquot suite with a murphy bed  It was a dissapointment but it overlooked the pier and we enjoyed the fireworks and view  I made them promise me a room that would reserve and kindle my frustration with them and their lack of hospitality  They provided me and my wife complimentory meals at Currents and put us up in a very large corner room near the top of the hotel   It was beautiful  It made up for it  Weve spoken highly of the hotel and the room since but I must say that Im very concerned over their common quotoverbookingquot practices and some of their pompus lower level employees  The credit goes to the manager for making it right and his professional interaction and accomodations  Currents was pleasant but quotcoldquot    
P => a glass wall Ive stayed twice here both reserved via a discount web site and Ive had twice nothing to complain  First time room was with view on the river nd time on the lake    Hotels architecture is nice location near all point of interets and rooms are large clean quiet  bathrooms are some of the nicest Ive ever seen    An adress to recommand and to keep in Chicago  
P => Memorable Experience at the Swissotel This hotel was extremely excellent  The location was a little removed from North Michigan but it was a very short walk to N  Michigan and the Loop attractions  However the incredible view of the lake makes up for the distance  We were able to upgrade and have a lake view room where we were able to watch the fireworks at Navy Pier  It is very accomodating for the business traveler but very relaxing and comfortable for the leisure traveler  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was very nice  It had both a shower and a tub and well as ample lighting  The hotel people were very courteous and helpful  I suggest shopping around for the best price  We were able to find it on priceline com so it was very affordable  Even after our upgrade it was still only around  night  
P => terrific in every way The location is as perfect as the hotel You are right between the Chicago Art Institute and the Mag Mile  Service was excellent and the suites were large and comfortable  well worth the extra money  On the top floors you have access to the gym and spa and a great continental breakfast  The bedding was sumptuous as were the ble bathrooms with lots of fluffy towels and robes  A very great place to stay that has everything you need and then some  
P => Best Stay Ever Unbelievable stay at the Swissotel Chicago Everything there was in great shape and all the staff were wonderful  Upgraded to a  level suite at check in     biggest hotel room I have ever seen   degree views of the River Navy Pier Lake and down Lake Shore Drive Executive Lounge is a must if possible  Great service in there and a nice quiet place to grab a drink and just talk  Will definitely be coming back to the Swissotel Chicago  
P => snobbish hotel but nice and clean I stayed at this hotel in tember and got a great deal at hotwire com  It is in a very convenient location  The only drawback were Parking was very outrageous and the people that were staying at this hotel were snobs  The staff at the front desk and the concierge were a bunch of snobs as well    very arrogant  A definate turn off  The rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible  If one is not turned off by the reception one gets when one checks in then its a great hotel    just try to ignore them all and youll do fine 
P => Great views Very nice hotel with well trained staff  But the beds are most uncomfortable Get a room on the lakeside the view from the higher floors is wonderful  
P => Loved the Swissotel Expensive Parking but great rooms  I got a great rate from an internet site at the Swissotel  Even my cityview room had a great view of the Chicago River  The concierge was quite helpful with dinner reservations  Rooms were nicely furnished  Desk was adequately sized and there was high speed internet acess  Gym large and there is a great view from the nd floor  Pool is nice with whirlpool and saunas in the locker rooms  Parking is expensive  I took the advice from another reviewer and parked in the city lot under Millenium Park and walked less than two blocks to the hotel paying    The water pressure was low in the bathtub but I found nothing else to complain about  Excellent location just off of Michigan Avenue yet close to the Art Institute and Grand Park  
P => Nice We enjoyed our stay at Swissotel The staff was courteous professional and efficient the room very pleasant and the location great The contemporary hotel is located on the southeastern edge of the Chicago River just several blocks from Michigan Ave  shops amp the very interesting architecture of the Loop  The rooms are business oriented so they are not as hip or stylish as say the Sutton Place or the W  But still very nice  The bathroom was my favorite  The pleasant view from our window looked out towards an office building in one direction and the Chicago River Tribune Tower amp points north in the other since the building is triangular there are interesting views The top floor pool amp exercise room is a nice place to stop in after a day of sightseeing and take in the fabulous view of the Lake amp Navy Pier  Since the hotel garage was rather expensive day so we deposited the car  blocks away in the Grant Park underground garage circa day and just walked or took the El during our stay  We had gotten a great rate via the internet which made our stay at Swissotel even better 
P => Top Notch Hotel

P => Amazing views and service  
P => Very Disapointed Again  
P => Best Birthday Ever  
P => Hotel perfetto   location   confort   estetica  
P => Genial  
P => 
P => Great Place to stay I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past two months  It is south of the mile across from the park which makes it a much quieter place  It is only a few minute cab ride or walk up to the action on the mile or over on State  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice  One of the nice things is that it is a smaller hotel compared to the Hilton next door and the other convention size places and that makes for a really nice stay without the convention crowds in the lobby  
P => Lovely hotel convenience of location depends on the traveler    I stayed at the Blackstone A Renaissance Hotel for two nights for a short getaway  The plan was to do a little sightseeing shop and visit Harpo Studios as an audience member    The hotel is lovely  The building is just breathtaking though the interior is a bit too modern and does clash  The rooms were a very nice size with a huge bled bathroom  The bed was comfortable there is a large flat panel TV wireless which is not free and just overpriced and a Starbucks located right in the hotel though that staff just did not know what they re doing so it really was not that much of a bonus   It really is just a beautiful hotel  Service well to be very honest the check in staff was a bit uppity  I found the female employees to be rather rude upon check in so I really didn t feel like asking them anything  The doormen were incredibly wonderfully helpful and kind as was the cleaning staff  I m sure service is fine at the Blackstone but we were really put off by the tone when we arrived  However this does not make or break a person s stay  I think I can put up w just about anything as long as I m in a clean room w a good location  And location is something you need to seriously consider before booking your stay at the Blackstone  I think to get to Harpo Studios the location is fine  It s a  tip included cab ride to the show  If you re visiting the Chicago Art Museum or Millennium or Grant Park it s a ten minute walk  To Chicago O Hare airport it s a good  minutes by taxi at  tip included or  hour  minutes by metro only recommend using during the day have to change lines after first stop for    However if you want to be in the middle of things and I think we all do you should not stay at this hotel  I think that if travelers should stay at the hotels located on the Magnificent Mile where all the restaurants and shops are  Hotels over there are also a ten minute walk from the parks and museums  The Blackstone while lovely and comfortable is just not as conveniently located as other hotels with the same rate or lower  At night being two women alone in the city we felt a little more weary in this location  Also normally on my trips I prefer taking a city s metrosubway   it s just a great way to save money On this trip we didn t do that despite the close location of the metro  minute walk  Even walking from the metro to our hotel in the day we felt a little unsafe so we sure weren t going to take it at night But to reiterate this is a lovely hotel just wasn t a convenient enough location and not enough shops or restaurants around  
P => Like a hotel you would see in the movies I was blown away by this hotel  It was absolutely gorgeous My taxi driver commented and Im not sure if this is true or not that the hotel was completely remodeled a few years ago which initially made me feel a bit skeptical  But once I walked into the lobby I knew I liked the place  I really liked the style of the rooms very modern with a fun color scheme  The beds were comfortable and had quality linens  The bathroom had cool lighting and a great shower  If I were back in Chicago I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great hotel in South Loop   convenient to Soldiers Field My husband and I celebrated our  year anniversary in Chicago  I got him tickets to the Bears Browns game on   st  I booked the Blackstone because it was convenient to Soldiers Field  On a previous trip to Chicago I stayed up at River North and I really liked it there  The locaion on S  Michigan ave is great for South Loop attractions like Grant Park The Museums and Could Gate and of course is within walking distance to Soldiers field  It is a bit of a walk if you want to go up North to Magnificent Mile but its pretty convenient to most of the subway lines including the Loop  The back side of the hotel is a bit lonely at night especially on weekends  We walked to Lou Malnattis pizzeria for a late dinnerwhich is only about  blocks away but the street was a little eerie late at night  During the day it is fine though  Its a convenient short train ride to Lou Mitchells as well which is a wonderful place for breakfast  The hotel itself has a dimly lit refurbished lobby  The hallways however were nice and bright  We told the staff upon checking in that we were celebrating an anniversary and they said they upgraded our room  We were on the th floor overlooking some of the South Loop  Was hoping for a park view but oh well Not a big deal  Our room had a king bed which was super comfy  The room is about average size  I am from NYC so I am used to very small spaces  The bathroom was wonderful and modern equipped with an in mirror TV which for some reason didnt get the exact same channels as the TV in the room  There is a standing shower only with a rain shower head which was lovely  There are Aveda toiletries as well  Room is orated in a modern minimalist theme but overall very comfortable  Service was fine  We didnt really hang around the hotel too much but check in and check out was very smooth Another great breakfast place which is just a few blocks south on S  Michigan Ave is Yolk  It gets really crowded too especially before a Bears game But it is delish  Overall very happy with the Blackstone but I found that the rates for the hotel were slightly higher than some of the equal star rated hotels up on River North  Not sure if it was because of the Bears game there were a lot of people attending the game who stayed at the hotel but overall a pleasant stay  I would stay here again if I had to be in the South Loop  BTW we used the gym and it had very modern equipment and larger than I expected which was great 
P => Outstanding service and accommodations We stayed in late ober while in Chicago for a wedding  The staff here is excellent very service oriented and very friendly  We had a city view room on the th floor  The rooms are very clean and have cool contemporary look glass walled showers etc  The bedding is luxurious  Nice flat screen TV etc  What really made them standout was on Sunday when we were set to go home our flight was cancelled  We needed to stay another night  We had booked the rooms at a quotcheapquot rate over the internet  I thought they would really stick it to me to stay another night without the internet rate  They didnt do that  Instead the gave me a LOWER rate and UPGRADED my room to a suite looking over Grant Park  Unreal  It turned a bad thing getting our flight cancelled into an enjoyable extra night in Chicago  
P => I will be back Just spent three days and two nights at this lovely hotel and practically had to pry the two children  and  out with a crowbar  The staff was welcoming and gracious the room was large and beautiful and the fireworks from Navy Pier both nights pretty much ensured we would always pick a lakeside room  I have paid the same amount per night for a tiny room with no view in NYC so this was a real treat  We ate breakfast cheaply at both the Corner Bakery and the Chicago Carry Out next to the Travelodge and enjoyed fabulous tacos at Flacos Tacos so sadly did not try the restaurant at the Blackstone which would have been unappreciated by children anyway 
P => Awesome hotel great service Great hotel and the service was out of this world  Great workout facilities excellent location near parks clean rooms with character  Here was the clincher for me    my wife and I went out running in the morning  Walking in the door the front desk person   Jordan asked us to hold for a minute  He then ran and got us ice cold bottled water and cold towels  Later we used his intimate knowledge of Chicago to find places to eat and entertainment  Fantastic property  
P => Classic Renaissance Typical or classic Renaissance hotel  Refurbed older property  Lobby a little dark common for older property  But room was great clean and modern  Bathroom was also large  Inroom iPod radio a plus  This is what I expect from this chain  Friendly front desk  Unique bar in basement was very cool  Good value for business but for tourists it is a long walk to Miracle Mile  Close to stadium  Overall great choice for overnight business trip 
P => The Blackstone Hotel Awesome hotel  Excellent service beautiful view and the Tapas restaurant is amazing  
P => Amazing We are in Chicago for just one night but wanted to get a location central to the Shedd and Field Museum  We couldnt have done better Beautiful room and friendly staff We werent expecting a lake view room and got up graded  It is amazing to look out into the harbor and see the boats  Truely beautiful 
P => Incredible Fantastic Beautiful Wonderful We arrived on Saturday and requested an upper floor lake view room  We stayed in room  which is a corner room looking out on Lake Michigan  It was beautiful  Clean bright and very roomy  It exceeded all expectations  Being directly on Michigan Avenue we expected some road noise  There was very little  There was also no noise from the other guests  Zero  This hotel is beautifully appointed  The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming  The bed was very comfortable  The only negative was feather pillows and no extra blanket in the room  I know every upscale hotel has feather pillows and it is very hard to get foam  I still slept very good because the bed was so comfortable  Room service was so so  The prices are very high and you must be very specific on what you want  We ordered coffee with cream and got milk  Not too tragic however when you pay   for coffee with cream and it takes  hour at least give me cream  The hotel restaurant wasnt too good for dinner but has a wonderful breakfast  The  eggs any style are a fantastic deal  Worth it  We went to see the Chicago Bears game and ended up walking to Soldier Field  We ended up walking to our destinations and cabbing back after dinner etc  It is in a great location for seeing the city  
P => Unexpected luxury The Hotel I was there for a  night stay which qualified me for an upgraded corner room overlooking Michigan Avenue and Grant Park on the th floor plus a  voucher for room service or the onsite restaurant  Those were very nice perks  As for service they loaned my friend and I umbrellas for walking around downtown and were  The size and cleanliness of my room was excellent  it had carrerra ble baths and a unique room layout making it feel spacious  The hotel itself is classic and well built with ornate details throughout  The gym has many newer machines and treadmills and lots of them  Ive never seen so many guests working out at AM as I did at the Blackstone Negatives Wireless internet was  plus a dollar tax in room but free in the lobby  That was barely convenient for checking email The location Very good for walking to Millennium park the Art Institute to the north and even the Field Museum and Soldier Field to the south  Taxi rides make things much easier and getting to the Cubs game was no problem via walking to the nearest red line station  For a leisurely breakfast try quotYolkquot just south a few blocks  The variety of breakfast food was impressive  
P => Great room and location with friendly staff Was in Chicago for a long weekend and loved this hotel  Would definitely return  The rooms were spotless and nicely reated it was contemporary with the charm of an older hotel  The staff was awesome they upgraded us to lakeview free of charge since rooms were available  We got a good deal on the room and would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Excellent Staff Beautiful Rooms   Gorgeous Hotel with history Along with a hoard of other kind folks I stayed here for the U shows at Soldier Field  I cant think of anything to complain about Everything was amazingly well done by a professional amp courteous staff  The restoration is beautiful and the employees are proud of their property deservedly so ah I thought of something to complain aboutThe queen beds in my room were fantastic The plush top notch bedding amp linens Ive come to expect from the riott family were even nicer than usual However the king bed in a friends room wasnt so great   not nearly as comfortable and not up to the Renaissanceriott standard  So if you have a choice go with the queen room The bathroom was great   Aveda products amp good lighting  The TV in the bathroom mirror was amusing but mostly a gimmick  I like the local art on the walls the connections to Chicago history and the selection of books on local lore   the overall attention to detail here is what made my trip so enjoyable  The hotel was completely full but once in my room I didnt hear any other guests Unlike another reviewer I found the Doormen Concierge and desk staff to all be very friendly amp helpful  Theo amp Jordan couldnt have been nicer or more helpful thanks Theo for the directions to Malnatis   you were right it was that good  The ever changing video feed from the roof is fun to watch Also late at night the lobby is a very relaxing place to chill with good music and free wifi  This is a fun hotel to explore and staff doesnt seem to mind you looking around My only other complaint about my trip is with the City of Chicago   the sales tax is a little steep at   but at night the hotel taxes are an insult to visitors  Traffic management was the worst Ive seen for a city of any size   but thats nothing to do with the Blackstone  If anything the Blackstone is a charming comfortable oasis in the midst of the city an oasis with good coffee in the lobby and within walking distance to Lou Malnatis pizza amp Garretts Popcorn   what else do you need 
P => Just the small things keep this from being a  star hotel My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance Blackstone Fri Sun of Labor Day weekend for Jazz Fest  We had stayed at the hotel the year before for the same reason and we will come again  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is perfect  Their staff needs to work on a few things to be more attentive to their guests  Our room faced southeast and had a lovely view of the Planetarium the Oceanarium and the Field Museum  Room was exceptionally quiet despite being on the corner of Michigan and Balbo  Our king bed was clean and the mattress was very comfortable  The suede chaise in the room is just perfect to stretch out on and read or watch television  Mini bar prices were reasonable room came with  spa robes  There is a Starbucks on the lower level with an outdoor seating area where we went on Sat  It was very pleasant to sit there and people watch and enjoy some coffee  We had breakfast on Sun in Mercat  My only quibble is that they need to increase their staffing for weekend morning breakfast service  There were a number of tables occupied and not enough servers  The hostess was doubling as the bartender  The servers were obviously stretched and were not too prompt with additional things like hot sauce etc  Prices are on the high side too  We noticed a number of people being seated checking out the menu and then getting up and leaving without eating  If youre on a budget you might want to just go to the Starbucks for their oatmealpastries  Fitness center is clean and has about  treadmills  Ellypticals and a free weights room  Towels fruit water provided and the door requires a room key card to prevent outsiders from accessing the facilitiessecurity  Doormen should be more prompt to welcomeacknowledge guests  When I arrived alone my husband was arriving later I got out of a taxi with my luggage and started up the stairs on Balbo before anyone acknowledged mewelcomed meoffered me assistance  Sat evening we came out of the hotel to go to dinner and stood and waited while the bellmenvaletdoormen stood around and chatted and never approached us  We finally went to the curb and hailed a cab ourselves and the doorman acted surprised that we had done so on our own  Front desk staff is good I noticed that the concierge seemed overwhelmed on Sun as people were asking for assistance with site seeing wanting to check bags etc  More attention to staffing on weekends is needed  Overall they are close to being a  star hotel and much more cozy accessible and updated than the tired Chicago Hilton amp Towers next door which is enormous impersonal and much more for conventioneers than for leisure or business travelers  
P => Awesome We were in town from waukegan for the U concert the rooms and service were definitely superior to hotels ive visited in Peoria and the Washington DC areas it was just awesome 
P => The perfect mix of eclectic modern appointment and history This historic building is absolutely beautiful  Dont let the age put you off    the rooms have been updated and provide a perfect guest stay  Ours faced Lake Michigan so we could look out over the weekend fireworks at Navy Pier If you need to be at the Chicago Hilton for an event skip the Hilton and stay across the street at the Blackstone  
P => Finishing Touches Show True Quality My teenage sister and I stayed at The Blackstone during American Idol auditions  It was an incredibly convenient location with in amp out parking privileges which allowed us to go back and forth between the auditions with no problem  It was just across the street a short  minute walk from Lake Michigan  On the interior of the hotel the or was incredible In the lobby they maintained the historical details of the building  On the interior of the rooms they were amazing  The place has obviously had a complete overhaul from top to bottom and the finishing touches show that whoever did the reation paid very close attention to detail and used all high end finishes  Everything in the hotel room was better than we could have asked for from the amazingly fluffy beds and pillows to the fully stocked mini fridge to the flat screen TV huge desk and the bathroom  The bathroom was impeccable with ble floors and counter tops  We never heard anything through the walls either  The place is built completely solid  The staff was also incredibly helpful  We had a great experience and would stay here again any day of the week  
P => Wonderful We stayed at the Blackstone for  nights in ust  Overall we were pleased with the accomodations  The room was quite spacious the beds were very comfortable and the staff members were helpful  We picked this hotel because it had been recently reated and they did a wonderful job with it  Its not too big a hotel either which i think is great when you have kids with you  We had breakfast at the Mercat each morning and it was enjoyable and fairly priced There is  thing I did not like  The day we were leaving ust th was the beginning of La La Palooza  Prior to making my reservation i phoned the hotel to ask whether or not they could accomodate a late check out on the th  I was told it shouldnt be a problem  The day i checked in ust th i was told the same thing although they told me i should let them know the morning of the th  So i did  And the response I got was quotim sorry but because of the La La Paloozaquot taking place this weekend we are unable to accomodate your reuqest quot Well its not like the festival came as a surprise  I would have appreciated it if I had been told of this prior to confirming my reservation  If this is an annual event that sells out their rooms they could have been honest about it from the get go and told me so  The location of the Blackstone places it right at the center of the festival   i could have picked a hotel more north of Grant Park to have avoided this  So that actually annoyed me that day  Otherwise it you are looking for a comfortable clean and upscale place to stay the Blackstone would be it  
P => Best in Chicago I travel for work and sometimes leisure often  I try to stay in a new place each time until I find my favorite hotel in each city  I have to say that the Ive stayed in a number of Chicago hotels amp I can definitely say that the Blackstone is hands down my favorite  Heres what I like about the place conveniently located staff is friendly starbucks connected with hotel rooms are well designed and very very comfortable beds also conveniently set up for business internet and most importantly the hotel just has a pleasant and uplifting energy about it if you believe in that sort of thing  I just feel happy when I stay here  A good comfortable atmosphere thats stylish Cons paying for wifiI would definitely recommend  
P => Fantastic Great hotel great staff great location Great fitness center  Buy a  day transit pass  Well worth it  You can get everywhere by subway or bus from this hotel  
P => Avoid the Blackstone  King Queens  Bait  My wife and kids and I had a very disappointing experience at the Blackstone this past weekend  I had booked two rooms for two nights at the Blackstone  months ago for Lollapalooza this year and it turned out to be a very poor choice  When I had tried to book the rooms on the Blackstones website it would only let me book rooms described as quot King or  Queen quot Because my wife and I were traveling with four teenagers I called the Blackstones reservation number to make the reservation instead of doing it on line so that I could confirm that I would be able to get  rooms with  beds in each room  Given that I was booking the rooms so early I was assured by the person taking the reservation that this wouldnt be a problem  However when we got to the hotel we were told that there were no quotdouble queenquot bed rooms available  Obviously we wouldnt have booked the Blackstone hotel if I had known this would be the case and we werent alone in this experience  The couple checking in next to us was told the same thing and had the same problem  The Blackstone clearly knows how many King bedrooms and double Queen bedrooms that it has when it takes reservations  This quot King or  Queen bedsquot option was simply a quotbait and switchquot scam by the Blackstone  Dont be fooled by this like we were  To make matters worse from the time we checked in it took  calls and  hours for the hotel to bring up  roll away beds  And then to cap off our less than stellar Blackstone experience there was urine still in the toilet in one of the rooms that we checked into on Friday  While this didnt ruin our experience it certainly wasnt pleasant The Blackstone is a very nicely orated hotel and the rooms are very comfortable  From the stand point of the rooms they were fine  However at this point I cant imagine recommending the Blackstone to anyone staying in Chicago  If you want to experience downtown Chicago stay at the Affinia  My wife and I have stayed there several times and it is excellent  And if youre coming down to Lollapalooza next year Id suggest staying at the Hilton or perhaps even the Travelodge  They are both just as close to Grant Park and if you make a reservation you will know what youre getting  
P => Its all in the details We stayed at the Blackstone over Memorial Day weekend and it was a really perfect stay  Beautiful property in a great location  The bathroom was gorgeous and the bed super comfy  The room was compact but had just about everything youd need though no mini fridge  The biggest con is the exhorbitant parking rate but I spose thats to be expected in what can be an expensive city to visit  However I would suggest checking out one of the numerous lotsgarages in the vicinity  The hotel charges  per night for valet  That rate is also very similar to the garage rate just across the street at the Hilton which I believe is where The Blackstone valets park guest vehicles  Not sure if there are in and out privileges included but we found a nice new ish secure garage at the corner of th and State  Just a block away from the hotel  Its in the same building as the Lou Malnattis restaurant and the entry is on th Street between Wabash and State  The overnight rate was from    Cant recall the name of the garage but there is a digital sign affixed to the outside of the building above the entry that says  hour parking  There were two or three open air street level parking lots but the garage worked really well for our stay  Hope this little parking tutorial helps  
P => Superb in every way The Blackstone has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at period end of story  From the extremely comfortable feather beds to excellent customer service to turn down service with chocolates no detail is overlooked at the Blackstone  The staff is very friendly and helpful the hotel is as clean as any hotel I have ever stayed in  The fitness center is also excellent it has tall windows with panoramic views as far as Lake Michigan and fresh fruit available for the end of your workout  The compliments could just go on and on but simply put stay at the Blackstone and you will not be disappointed 
P => Exceptional service  Excellent Property  Fabulous views of the lake and park Hotel staff went out of thier way to take care of our room no matter what the request Maids were excellent  Houskeeping very well organized  Check in was fast  Sodasavailable in lobby for purchase  Valet Parking is expensive but there are much cheaperlots all around the hotel I usually see lots of things that need to be fixed or improved  I did not see one thing that needed fixing or improving I would recommend hotel to everyone Note There is not a pool but there is an excercise room  
P => Loved it I stayed at the Blackstone for two nights while attending a conference at the mammoth Hilton next door  The Blackstone is a lovely hotel   a much nicer place to stay than the impersonal rather tired Hilton  The welcoming helpful staff really set the Blackstone apart  From the bell staff who rush to help you with your bags or hail you a taxi to the housekeeping staff who keep the rooms spic and span they all did a first rate job  Its definitely worth reserving a lakeview room mine was on the th room and the views were spectacular   Lake Michigan with all its sailboats Grant Park and a view of the city from Navy Pier to the north all the way down to the Museum Campus and Soldier Field in the south  The room or was funky modern the bed was supremely comfortable and everything worked well including the flat screen HDTV with lots of channels  The bathroom was spic and span lots of fluffy towels were provided as well as bathrobes  No bathtub but an excellent spacious shower  As other reviewers have pointed out the frosted glass sliding bathroom door is a problem for those who are sharing a room and want some privacy  As I was staying by myself it wasnt an issue The only slight drawback was that the hotels excellent tapas restaurant Mercat a la Planxa was closed for reations during my stay   would have loved to try it  But it was fun to be right across the street from the Taste of Chicago event I felt so comfortable and pampered that it was hard to leave my room to attend my conference  Would love to stay here again on my next visit 
P => This is a great hotel I was in Chicago for business for three days and really enjoyed staying at the Blackstone  Everything was customer service related check in smooth and efficient all questions answered very promptly gave a late check out to  p m  It was a busy time in the city Taste of Chiacgo right across the street but the hotel was calm and quiet  I nenver heard noise of other guests which is something that really bugs me in many hotels  The restaurant is closed for  days while re tiling but the great food is available from room service  We had a drink there the night before closing and the ambience was very nice although a bit noisy  The room had a little view of the lake from a comfortablle chair  Great lighting for reading in bed and a very comfortable bed  Aveda shampoo etc my favorite brand  Really cant say enough about this great stay and it was very reasonable for the summer  
P => Excellent Choice My stay was excellent  Upon entering someone immediately asked to assist with my luggage and another graciously parked the car  Hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful  The room was a bit on the small side but very elegant  The only downfall is the bathroom door  Even when closed you can still see inside  If you are with a group or having visitors and do not want to use the bathroom inside the room because of the door I know that there is a woman s bathroom located on the th floor not sure about one for men  It is also across the street from Grant Park and one black away from where the trolley tours make a stop at Hilton  
P => Absolutely the Best Hotel in Chicago with the Nicest Staff We were in Chicago for my teenager to check out Columbia College  The Blackstone looked like the closest hotel and I noticed that it had recently been reated  It was beautiful The room was large the beds were so comfy and the staff were happy to help with anything we asked of them  Room service cuts off at  though   so order early or take a walk to a nearby restaurant  The location is superb  Its right across from Grant Park and about a  minute slow walker walk to Millenium Park  
P => Great area of town nice historic hotel We pulled up and they were on us like flys at a picnic one was helping with the luggage the other was parking the truck  We stayed two nights paid  on priceline which I thought was a good price  Asked several times during our stay for local information and the staff was very friendly and knew exactly where we needed to go based on our description of what we were looking for  This is within walking distance of several great Chicago landks  Upon check in I asked for a city view which they graciously granted This is a great property  Room was recently updated not the biggest room but plenty of room for my wife and I  We didnt eat in the hotel but the restaurant was packed most of the time we were there  Very classy place  
P => Beautiful hotel ok location personable but unknowledgable staff  My dhter and I went for a  day weekend for a wedding  We arrived on Friday afternoon  We felt welcome from the moment we arrived  We were greeted by friendly doormen who opened the cab door for us and took our luggage inside  We checked in went to our room which was on the th floor  Snacks and drinks were provided for an extra charge which we did not use  I noticed coffee and tea but found it strange that sweetner and creamer were not provided  We loved the actual room  Nice big bed great desk and chair but I can honestly say the bathroom designlayout was lousy  It reminded me of the MGM Grand in Las Vegas  Must be the same architect  You absolutely have no privacy with these bathrooms  Everything is all in one room  The bathroom door just slides over the opening doesnt shut  Therefore anybody sitting in the bedroom area can hear everything that is going on in the bathroom  You might as well leave the door open  There was no purpose in it at all  Very odd  The shower was nice and big but again no door which is ok except water gets everywhere on the floor  I think the toilet should always be arate from the rest of the bathroom  Never can  people get ready at the same time  Would be embarassing if you had a guest visiting with you in your room and then someone used the bathroom  You would hear it all  Poor design Blackstone  My dhter and I would joke about it and whoever needed to use the bathroom then the other would wait on the bed and had to turn the TV on to make some distraction noise We were happily surprised by the Blues Fest we came across at Grant Park which was across the street  Location was fine but noisy for sure  The staff was friendly but not well informed as they should be about directions and restaurants  We asked where we should go for famous Chicago pizza and we were given directions and never found the place  This happened  different times  I asked about Italian Beef sandwiches and nobody had a clue as to where to get those Chicago is famous for them and on my last day walking around there was a restaurant within one block of the hotel that had them  I would think they would know this  They told us how to take the bus which was  each person but did not inform us that for only   you could purchase a day pass and ride all you wanted to  We learned this the last day as well and wasted money because we were not informed of this  Its a college area and safe and fun  But next time I would stay some place else closer to the shops and I would make sure the bathrooms were a bit more private  Just my thing I guess 
P => Very nice but a little lacking This is a charming property with an interesting juxtaposition of modern orating on a historic foundation  We were delighted to hear a little of the hotel history while on our Gray Line bus tour of the city  I booked this hotel for  on Priceline  surely a good deal  but was disappointed to get short shrift on service  It is not the first time that I felt I have gotten second citizen treatment when dealing with a Priceline reservation  I called four times in the course of two weeks six weeks in advance of the trip to request a room with two beds only on the fourth call did someone actually put my request in the system  Upon early check in however I was given only a king room with the promise of a rollaway  Come our return to the room at  pm no rollaway had been added to the room  Upon visiting the front desk I was told that a rollaway would not fit in the room because of fire codes that there were no rollaways left and that there were no other rooms available  Finally I was given the use of a quotparlor roomquot  essentially a meeting room on another floor that had a fold out couch  I was happy for some accomodation after the broken promise but overall disappointed that we could not have gotten a two bed room to begin with  The hotel was clean and the rooms were comfortable  The maid service was only fair despite good tipping the half empty toiletries were not replenished after the first night  At checkout my room was given someone elses mini bar charges an error that was corrected with a phone call  Overall this is a hotel with great character that could use a little improvement on the personnel front  
P => Are you kidding me When we arrived at the hotel at pm the front desk staff informed us that our room was no longer available we had confirmed our reservation earlier in the day and made amp paid for the reservation  months ago  The customer service was much below the standards of a hotel that is affiliated with riott which follows the values of quotDo Whatever it Takes to Take Care of the Customerquot We were told that the Blackstone would accommodate us at another hotel however this hotel would be near O Hare airport  We live about  miles south of Chicago so this would have made no sense  Our night was ruined on the account of Blackstone Hotel  We were planning on spending the weekend in Chicago and this could no longer happen  The manager said we would be reimbursed for our room and we were given money for a cab ride home  The staff did not seem a bit apologetic for their mistakes  I was so angry and I couldnt believe when a security guard came to me and said he would escort me out if I didnt calm down Didnt I have every right to be angry UNBELIEVABLE 
P => Pleasant Annversary I booked this room for  through expedia com  I think by far the best deal I have ever gotten on a hotel  This is a very nice and elegant hotel with a great or  We stayed night in the city for our anniversary and had a pleasant evening  We were not there very long and did not require any service from the hotel so that is something I can not comment to much on  The hotel has a very good location next to Grant Park we took a nice evening stroll and heard part of a jazz concert  It has an excellent tapas restaurant   things people  want to know in advance are that on each floor the of the  or so rooms  rooms face the lakepark  The other thing is the bathroom is basically open to the rest of the room  There is a frosted glass door that slides shut to partially obscures the view  This is fine if you are with your spouse or alone but  not be what you want to share with your children  There is no shower door in the bathroom so turn up the heat while taking a shower I would greatly recommend this hotel but would just advise you know what you are getting  
P => Beautiful Classic Historic Perfect My wife and I stayed for a nice weekend the first part of   We had booked at riott com and saved nearly  by paying in advance  The hotel was in an excellent location just four blocks away from the Orange and Red line station  Our room looked over Michigan Avenue and had a terrific view of Buckingham Fountain and Lake Michigan  Buddy Guys Legends is a quick  minute walk and it is very easy to walk to such sights as the Sears Tower musuem Soldier Field and other sights There were only three negative that I can think of  The bathroom door is just a slider and doesnt provide the ideal amount of privacy    not a big deal but I can see how some people would be bothered by that  Parking was the other issue  As in most of downtown Chicago parking is expensive and it was day for parking with in and out privileges  We got lucky however and found parking in an open lot one block west of the hotel  day but it was an unsecured lot  We had a rental car so were not too concerned but in inclement weather or having a higher end vehicle you  want to consider the parking on site  The hotel did have a free business center which is great but it only has two computers and during our stay the printers were not working  
P => Absolutely first rate This hotel is classy luxurious and modern chic all in one  I loved it  The rooms are fairly spacious and the bathrooms are quite large although not really quotprivatequot  Showers are totally open and the bathroom door was more of mini blind  The amenities are nice but not over the top  It s a bit farther from the action of the River North or Magnificent Mile than I would prefer but it was close to the conventions at McCormick Place  In terms of hotels in Chicago this one has been the best I was hosting a morning breakfast at the hotel early in the morning and had a bit of crisis the night before  The staff stayed late until almost pm to accomodate my last minute changes to the meeting plan More on my time in Chicagohttpjustanothertravelblog blogspot comchicago illinois html 
P => Very Posh   just a little noisy  Not your average hotel  This is probably the best hotel Ive ever stayed at  Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Chicago  The fitness center had the newest and best equipment tv screens with ipod ports on every treadmillelliptical  
P => Very nice downtown Chicago hotel We stayed for one night a Sunday night at the Blackstone during a   trip to Chicago  Upon arrival we learned that the valet parking service at the Blackstone is slightly more expensive than the self parking at the Hilton parking garage across the street   which was still pricey but not as bad We found the staff at the Blackstone to be friendly and helpful  Our room a basic king bed room was very nice clean and comfortable  One of the lights over the bed did not work but we didnt report it  The bathroom is really nice ble and such but we werent too impressed with the modern shower head   just not enough water pressure for our liking I guess  The towels and bed linens were all top notch For wireless internet users its going to cost you   per day to use it in your room however in the lobby area it is free  We just took our laptop down to the Starbucks that is attached to the lobby and used it there with no problem Checkout went smoothly and there was no problem with storing our bags for the day while we shopped downtown before heading home We got an amazing rate on our room so I was MORE than happy to be staying at the Blackstone however when I looked up what the normal rates are I have to say that I dont think I would pay THAT much to stay there  But it was very nice and no major problems to report  
P => Great hotel in an ideal location After reading all of the great reviews my wife and I ided to stay at the Blackstone  As one would expect from a Renaissance property the hotel is well appointed and has a very friendly and service oriented staff  The location is one of the best features of the hotel  Located right next to beautiful Grant Park and Lake Michigan it is an ideal place to go for a stroll  Located as it is a little south of the prime shopping district the hotel is away from a lot of the hustle and bustle while still located in a fantastic area convenient to many attractions and sights As for the hotel itself the lobby is beautifully orated  Also the fitness center is simply the best Ive ever seen at a hotel and includes many state of the art cardiovasular machines  The rooms are likewise very nice  Though the historic nature of the property is evident    some worn areas on the wallpaper and molding etc     every effort has been made to create tasteful and luxurious rooms  There was a high definition flat screen TV a very comfortable bed and some nice touches including some books about Chicago  The only issue we had was with the bathrooms  be its picky but the door to the bathroom is a sliding door and doesnt slide all the way closed  Also the shower didnt have a door that closed all the way    causing water to spill onto the bathroom floor Overall though this is a great hotel that is convenient to a lot of attractions in Chicago  Hint request a lakeview room  
P => Great hotel but bathroom is not private No complaints except for the bathroom door in our hotel room  It is a sliding door and when the door is quotclosedquot you can still see in through the sides of the door   really bizarre great for voyeurs  I dont know who designed this door but they werent thinking of the guests privacy  
P => Great hotel great service My  year old dhter and I stayed at the hotel for two nights as we searched for colleges for her  The Blackstone is great  The location on Michigan Ave  is close to Grant Park it is only a couple of blocks from the El and if you are a walker you can walk to many locations  The staff was always friendly and helpful especially the bellmen  The rooms are modern and unique  they dont look like typical hotel rooms  The beds are comfy the TV is great  Having a Starbucks in the building makes for a quick breakfast if needed  All in all a great stay  
P => If I could live at The Blackstone I would WOW What a GREAT find I just returned from a wonderful trip to Chicago and staying at The Blackstone was definitely a highlight From the moment we arrived we received nothing but top of the line service     every person on the staff was over the top friendly courteous and helpful  The rooms were SPACIOUS and GORGEOUS  Obviously recently updated our room had a ble entry and bathroom the beds had down comforters a plasma TV on the wall and plenty of room to spread out It was quiet and very clean  There is a nice business center with two computers with free internet access and printers this was great to research directions or restaurants  It is directly across the street from Grant Park and there are a few eateries within a few blocks  One night we came back to the hotel late around pm or so and wanted to order pizza     the woman at the front desk provided us with three different brochures of nearby places that deliver Our midnight snack was delicious As far as getting around the subway is about  blocks away however we found that the buses were super convenient and easy to use     or we walked We were two single gals traveling together and we never felt unsafe anywhere around the hotel or anywhere in Chicago  We paid night in mid il for two queen beds     what a steal I even booked on the riott website so I didnt have to pre pay and could cancel up until pm on our arrival date if needs be  Luckily that wasnt the case We were told by a local that this hotel used to fall into the quotseedyquot category however it was recently purchased by riott and they are trying to turn around its previous reputation  So far I believe they are doing a FABULOUS job I would HIGHLY recommend this property to anyone staying in Chicago     a great hotel and great location 
P => Great stay Was staying in town for business and attending a convention at McCormick  This hotel was a  minute bus ride bus provided by the convention which stopped at the Hilton located next door  The staff was very helpful rooms were spacious and clean with a contempory feel  Had a wonderful view of the lake  
P => Interesting historic hotel with a funky modern update This is a great hotel if you dont want to be right in the middle of shopping and would rather be closer to museums universities etc  Do ask for a room with a view and you will wake up to Grant Park and Lake Michigan  Everything about this hotel is unique including the metallic gold tufted couches in the lobby  The rooms are very modern and have tremendous bathrooms  Theres a Starbucks in the lobby and a great tapas restaurant  Parking was expensive but its expensive everywhere in downtown Chicago  My dhter and I walked to shopping and restaurants and saw the Chicago River turn green  It was a great place  
P => Every staff member made you feel welcome I went to the AORN Congress this last week and stayed at the Blackstone  I purchased my room through Priceline so I feel the value was exceptional  The room was beautiful with a nice bathroom and rainfall shower  The service is what puts this hotel above many others  The staff was fantastic  I was made to feel welcome and valued as a customer  The location is great with most attractions within a  cab ride or within walking distance  Shedd Aquarium Field Museum the planetarium Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile  The food at the Blackstone was good if not a little expensive  I paid  for a sandwich via room service but what I got was so big it was lunch and dinner  I highly recommend the Blackstone when staying in Chicago I know I will go back  
P => Awesome historical hotel with a modern twist    This hotel was amazing  The location is right on Michigan Ave on one end so you can walk all along it for great restaurants shopping and sightseeing  In terms of the hotel itself the or is very trendy while still maintaining its historical facade  Everything seemed very new and well maintained  The room king size was nicely composed flat screen HD comfy chairs and shower but no bath The best part for me was the free internet in the business center I also liked the witty do not disturb signs that read instead quotPlease Go Away   I am debating with JFKquotOverall a very pleasant stay great location great hotel and at a ent price 
P => Very nice place and a great value  A nicely refurbished classic old hotel with elegant public areas and modern comfortable spacious well supplied and well operating rooms  Friendly staff in the lobby  Just three blocks to the Art Institute and a few more blocks to State Street shopping and some of the business centers  All in all a very pleasant place and a great value though the tapas restaurant inside was overcrowded and overpriced  Highly recommended  
P => A real gem My family of four stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago  We all absolutely loved the Blackstone  The room was very contemporary while the public areas of the hotel maintained the buildings historic charm  The bathroom was large the shower more than adequate and the entire room very clean and I am a very picky traveler when it comes to cleanliness  The location while a little away from the excitement of most attractions was right on the bus line and directly across from Grant Park  It was very easy to zip across the street each morning and catch the bus  The staff was accomodating and I dont think Ive ever encountered bell hops who were more pleasant and helpful  This hotel is a definite keeper and one that you dont want to miss if youre visiting Chicago  
P => First time in Chicago  Terrific hotel  I stayed two nights at the Blackstone and really enjoyed it  Check in with Brett was very welcoming  So glad I booked a lakepark view room   nt  Loved the orfurnishings  Found it spacious  Did not dine at the hotel but got coffee at the Starbucks which closes earlier than usual  pm I think  Convenient location  The Michigan Ave public bus stops are one block north and one block south  Quirks   The mattress pillow top was a little too soft for my liking    The noise of my neighbors doors clickingslamming shut was startling  
P => Terrific hotel location staff  wonderful choice Although we only stayed at the Blackstone for one night we enjoyed our stay enough to say that we will definitely be back  Our room was very roomy the beds were so comfortable and the bathroom was very upscale with the latest features and terrific bath products  The hotel is located on south Michigan Avenue right next door to the Chicago Hilton and Towers  This is an excellent location for anyone visiting the museum campus Field Museum Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium  Its near Grant Park and Millennium Park so its a good location for anyone visiting any of the large festivals such as Taste of Chicago Jazz Fest Gospel Fest etc  Its just down the street from the Art Institute of Chicago  Another five star feature of this hotel is their staff  very warm and friendly and courteous  My boyfriend and I ided to walk around the hotel and look at some of its features like the Art Hall and the ballroom  We found the door to the ballroom locked but an employee of the hotel was getting off the elevator and saw us trying the door to the ballroom  He asked us if we would like to go in so he unlocked the door for us and gave us some time to look at the beautiful room and told us a little bit about the reation of the hotel  When we walked back to the lobby an employee named Arturo asked if we were enjoying our stay  We told him that we had just been walking around looking at different places in the hotel  He asked us if we had seen the historic Smoke Filled Suite  We said quotnoquot so he offered to take us up there to show it to us  The Smoke Filled Suite is a beautiful suite that has been reorated to look pretty much like it did in the s  Back in  when members of the Republic party were trying to ide on their presidential candidate they met in this suite  When they made their ision then opened the door to the waiting press outside the press was enveloped in a cloud of smoke that came out of the suite  Thus the phrase quotsmoked filled roomquot was adopted  This is a beautiful comfortable hotel with many interesting historical features and it comes highly recommended from this reviewer  
P => First Rate Hotel in a Great Location Our four night stay at The Blackstone was first rate in every respect  Our room was ready for early check in on arrival  This heritage building has been beautifully restored  Our lakeview room was spacious and comfortable with modern or  Great beds and bathroom shower only  Spotlessly clean as were the hallways and entrance lobby  Friendly helpful staff  Excellent location close to the Art Institute and Symphony  An easy walk to the Chicago Architectural Foundation store where bus tours of the citys architectural heritage are available  Glad we elected to spend the little extra for a lakeview room  The view from the th floor over Grant Park to the lake was lovely at sunrise and through the evening  We tried the restaurant for lunch and enjoyed our meal  
P => Enjoyed our stay My husband and I stayed at The Blackstone from      We were celebrating his th birthday  We got a great deal through Sams Club Travel for about night We chose this hotel for the value and its proximity to they typical tourists spots  It was close to the Harrison St subway stop  It is directly across the street from Grant Park  We were able to walk to Millennium Park Art Institute and the Magnificent Mile  We could see Shedd Aquarium and Soldier Field from our window The pictures shown on the website are exactly what you will see when at the hotel  Our room was very clean and comfortable   especially the bed  There were down pillows and comforters which made it very cozy after a day of sightseeing in the windy city  There was also an ipod dock with several adapters so we could play our own music in the room  The bathroom had funky black and white wallpaper and was accented with pops of red  There was everything you needed    boot buffer small sewing kit mouthwash cotton ballsswabs etc  There were snacks and beverages available for purchase  I would suggest getting these elsewhere  The prices were outrageous  A small can of nuts for Cant really comment on the staff  We didnt really need much of their help except when checking inout  They did hold our luggage after we checked out at no charge We enjoyed our stay here and hope to visit in the spring or summer  
P => Too expensive for the services PRO nice room nice view pay extra or get brick wall viewnice beds CONS have to pay for things that low end hotelsmotels like the SUPER  give away free   such as   for wi fi  for local calls  per nite for parking expensive breakfast  Ill stay at a lower end hotelmotel next time  
P => Fabulous Great attentive front desk  From the moment we walked in we knew this was a hotel which is attentive to detail  The woman who checked us in was friendly and had a very inviting presence  She showed us where the museums were gave us a map and explained how easy the walk would be to the area we wanted to go  The lobby is a super mix of the classic historical era and new and modern  The room was even better  Comfy bed pillows great bathroom with nice products Super view of the LakeWe loved our stay and would return  
P => Fabulous Place and Fantastic People  I stayed at the Blackstone recently for business  The management has done a fabulous job of reatiing this quotGrand Damequot of Chicago  The lobby is a combination of trendiness and old world elegance  The rooms are simply superb crisp linen comfortable relaxing chair flat screen tv and the bathrooms are some of the nicest with the club level room Hubbard Place Room having a tv bulit into the bathroom mirror  The location is quite convenient and the staff extremely courteous and helpful  Special thanks to k and Tom at the front desk for accommodating my special room requests  I would like to stay nowhere else when in Chicago  
P => Convenience and comfort The hotel is the nicest Ive stayed in the downtown area ultra modern mixed with historical charm  The entire staff was very helpful and friendly  The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are big  Ill definitely stay here again  
P => The Blackstone is AMAZING The Blackstone was amazing  The room was large and beautifully designed  The bathroom was oversized and luxurious  All of the finishes were top notch The service was great too  From the front desk to the bell boys and doormen  Everyone was terrifically helpful They even arranged their hotel car   Lexus LS   to take us to our New Years event  An unexpected little luxury And which is highly unusual for a full service hotel   they offered free internet The restaurant   Mercat   was awesome too  Spanish tapas  The food and service were excellent  
P => Absolutely loved the Blackstone I cannot say enough good things about my stay at the Blackstone   was here on business in mid ober   absolutely EVERYONE working there treated us so wonderfully   I had stayed at the Palmer House back in ch and the service didnt even begin to compare   if you have a choice choose the Blackstone   youll be very impressed 
P => Perfect Location This hotel has recently reopened from remodeling  It is walking distance to Soldier Field and a short drive to the United Center  We checked in around  PM on a Saturday and had no problem  The room was very nice no complaints  The bathroom has only a shower no tub and the riott beds were very comfortable as usual  The room did have a snack bar but it was very expensive  It also had a flat screen HDTV with all four main ESPN channels the most important ones  There is also a Starbucks in the hotel and a candy counter  The hotel doesn t have a buffet and room service was way too expensive so we just went over to the Hilton which is just across the street and ate a very good buffet breakfast at The Pavilion for half the price  per person  Check out wasn t a problem either and they ll valet your car for you  They even let us keep our car there after we checked out so we could go to the Bears game without driving around forever trying to find a parking place  It is a lengthy walk to Soldier Field but it is worth it just to keep your car there  
P => Amazing Hotel great location This is one of the nicest riott or Hilton hotels Ive ever stayed at  This is a nice compliment seeing as I usually do about  nights year  I heard they finished the reation in  yrs and the Beatles Yogi bought this place and paid  million for the reation  it sat vacant for  years  As youll see in the pictures Ive attached the property looks more like a super trendyhip boutique hotel  The staff is super nice and the executive lounge is very spacious and super classy  The attached tapas restaurant was also phenomenal and highly regarded in the area I will definitely stay here again if I get the chance 
P => Excellent Stay I stayed at the Blackstone for work and pleasure  Got an excellent room with a view of the Lake  The room was very quiet the bed very comfortable the shower terrific and the bathroom very modern  The location is also excellent tho a bit of a walk from from Water Tower  I would stay there again and highly recommend  
P => Great Hotel I highly recommend I must say that I was just HAPPY to get a room on priceline at a price that my company could afford in downtown Chicago much less this one I had never heard of the Blackstone my ignorance but now I cant let it go I even extended my trip I enjoyed it so much The lobby and Art Hall are just beautiful The hotel was carefully restored and is just stunning  The rooms are bright and airy with nice finishings and great Lather products in the ble filled bathroom  The ipod docking station was perfect for my iPhone  The hotel is quiet a calm oasis in the middle of the city  I loved the leather Eames chair in the room as well  I would have liked to been a little further north on Michigan but hey we cant have it all right The service to me was what really made me go and write a review  Friendly professional and just eager to please  There is also a great Tapas place and a real Starbucks not just a kiosk with a thermos in the hotel on the main level if you are interested  I would   recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again 
P => Pleasant Surprise My wife and I had originally booked a room at the Hyatt but due to issues outside of the Hyatts control they reserved a room for us at the Blackstone  We were very pleasanty surprised  The rooms have all been nicely updated and are very modern  The location lends itself well to anyone wanting to visit the Grant or Millenium Park the Museum Campus or Navy Pier  If you were up for a little exercise you could walk to shopping on the Miracle Mile or take a short cab ride We had our two small children along but the hotel is probably best suited for couples  Wed love to come back for a weekend without the kids  
P => Really Enjoyed the Location and the Staff My husband and I stayed here for  days and  nights during the Labor Day weekend  We typically visit Chicago at least once a year and this is the first time weve stayed at the Blackstone  The location was great   we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan and Grant Park  We were able to walk to the Shedd Aquarium and some of the museums in though there was a free trolley available just steps away from the hotel on Michigan Ave  The staff was friendly and seemed genuinely concerned about whether we were enjoying our stay  The only disappointments were not getting the fridge we requested with our reservation until the second day of our stay and some issues with the room thermostat  The room never quite cooled off to the temperature we set and it was a little warmer than Labor Day usually is in Chicago  Those were not huge issues and the staff was very apologetic about them    we would definitely stay here again  
P => What a Great Place After receiving a couple of suggestions of hotels near the Auditorium Theater in Chicago I settled on The Blackstone  It was a birthday surprise weekend for my wife  All I can say is she loved itThe Blackstone has been closed for about  years  It was due to become condos but the deal fell through and the riott Corp  picked up the property  We were somewhat nervous when the hotel wasnt listed in any of the guide books we had  The reason for not being listed is the hotel has only been reopened for about  months  There was no reason to be nervous We checked in early on a Friday morning without any difficulty whatsoever  We were there at about am but our room was ready so they allowed us to check right in  We were told by the front desk that we had been upgraded to a lake view room  Our room was on the th floor overlooking both Michigan Ave and Balbo  It was a corner room that had its own entry hallway On the lake side we had  huge windows and a third smaller window  The Balbo side had one huge window  The or is very modern although the hotel dates back to the early s  The bathrooms are all ble with huge walk in showers and rainfall shower heads  Again the bathroom fixtures are all very modern styled  The king bed was super comfortable with lots and lots of pillows Our weekend package included breakfast so we ate both mornings at the Mercat restaurant  It was very nice but a bit pricey One floor of the hotel is called the Art Hall  While we were checking out the Art Hall one of the hotel folks asked if we had seen the ballroom  Of course we hadnt and he opened the doors of Art Hall which put us in the balcony of the ballroom  It was awesome  A brilliant flower patterned rug was the focal point of the room which had just been finished and was going to host their first wedding this coming weekend The hotel lobby is again a mix of old world hotel with a modern touch  All very cool  The staff was there whenever you needed them and everyone was very eager to please  Our package included Citypasses for the  of us  They had run out so the concierge just told us to go see whatever museums we wanted and save the receipts and they would reimburse us  That worked out very well as we did want to make the most of every minute we had in Chicago and waiting around for passes wasnt on our itinerary I would highly recommend this hotel  It is very beautifully restored and the staff is very eager to please  
P => What a Great Surprise for her Birthday I ided on a surprise for my wife in the city  Unfortunately like many others family life and children dont always allow us the opportunity for romantic getaways  I searched for the right place and I sure am glad that I found The Blackstone Hotel  Located sweetly on Michigan Ave across the street from Grant Park  This was ultra convienent because it was also the weekend of the Chicago Jazz Festival  First thing we noticed when we went in was the nostalgic lobby except of course the Starbucks downstairs  The employees were friendly and courteous and gave us our room on the th floor  The Deluxe suite was loaded with modern or an amenities that were hard not to love HD flatscreen TV iHome alarm clock etc  The bathroom was spacious with quite a unique in a good way shower  The only thing lacking was great water pressure  But probably the most important aspect the bed was right on point  Spacious and comfortable king with down comforter and down pillows  Whats not to enjoyI plan for us to go back again  It definitely left a k on us and we loved our getaway  I imagine you will too  
P => Didnt want to leave My husband and I had friends who had their wedding and reception at the Blackstone on   th  According to the staff it was the first wedding at the hotel since the reations  We were both in the wedding party and were privy to many of the things behind the scenes that the guests were not  I speak for both my husband and I when I say that we were blown away at the level of service and the quality of the stay over the course of the weekend  Our friends had hired a wedding planner but the staff at the hotel  especially Flavia were the ones who really made the wedding day as special as it was  All of the staff were very accomodating and attentive to the bride as well as the groom going above and beyond making sure that needs were met and that everything was taken care of  The rooms were wonderful modern touches but very comfortable  The bride had booked the quotSmokingquot suite one of the rooms with quite a bit of political history for her over the weekend  We have NEVER seen a room as spectacular as this  the view overlooked Buckingham Fountain Navy Pier and Lake Michigan there were  bathrooms and the master bathroom has a TV in the mirror and there was a bedroom a sitting room and a combined dining and living room  The crystal ballroom was where the reception was held  The room was amazing and the hotel staff including a manager was present during the entire night to make sure that things ran smoothly  We live in Chicago and could have easily gone home but wanted our time at the Blackstone to be extended as long as possible so we were more than happy to have stayed overnight  This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in this includes the Ritz Carlton in St  Thomas we stayed at for our honeymoon and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to have a wedding  
P => A Step Back into History Traveled back to Chicago to celebrate our wedding anniversary  After looking at numerous hotels on North Michigan Ave  we tried something different stayed on the garden side of South Michigan and are we glad we did Everyone from the front desk clerk to the maids were very nice  The room was Outstanding  Compared to the cost for the hotels on Michigan Ave  The Blackstone is a diamond in the ruff  After a  million dollar remodel this will be my hotel to stay for years to come  I cant find anything negative about the property and made a reservation as soon as we got home to stay again next month  The view from our room wasnt the best but walk out the doors and one block away is Grant Park a few more blocks is the Lakefront  You cant go wrong with the Blackstone 
P => Wonderful Hotel Great Staff There were  of us that stayed at the Blackstone on  for a Cubs baseball game  I booked  rooms through priceline and got a really good deal going that way  I was excited to see the hotel we got and was looking forward to my trip back to Chicago  At check in we were informed there were no double beds available which kind of put us in a bind since we had  couples sharing one room plus there were no cots available so we had  people in a king bed  I do have to say they were very apologetic and did bring us extra pillows and blankets plus upgraded us to the th floor  Unfortunately when you book with priceline you can not request certain types of rooms  The rooms are very well orated and very clean  Being on the th floor we had a ent view of the skyline  We did not eat at the restaurant but did stop in for bloody ys before leaving for the game and that was one of the best bloody ys I have ever had  The red line is only a few blocks from the hotel and not hard to find  There are a few bars within walking distance including Legends Buddy Guys bar unfortunately when we went up there on Saturday night they wanted a  cover  Since none of us are big blues fans we ided to skip that and walk up to the small bar on the corner that had very good prices on drinks and very friendly service  If you want to go to the Navy Pier it is about a     cab ride  We did go to Dicks Last Resort for supper  One of my favorite places in downtown Chicago  The rest of the trip was the Cubs Cards game so spent a lot of time around Wrigley and hitting the Cubby Bear  Checkout on Sunday was very fast and efficient  They made a point to make sure our stay was without any trouble  I would definitely stay at this hotel again  They definitely have done a great job of upgrading this hotel and the staff makes it    
P => Neat stylish retro hotel Just stayed a night at this hotel  Booked an oversized room and it lived up to the billing    Queens good sized desk lounge chair very large bathroom and lots of room between everything  Kind of felt like an apartment it was so big  orated in a chic retro or that works a lot better than some of the minimalist retro properties Ive stayed at elsewhere it really works here and gives the property a luxorious feel  Property overall had a neat feel too with good service at front desk and tapas restaurant in front lobby tasty food too  Property undergoing some reations something you might want to ask about but I was in an upper floor and it was a non issue for me  I really liked this hotel wouldnt change a thing and would definitely stay there again  
P => Unique and Hip while maintaining the historic charm I work for another hotel company but our hotels were full so I booked here as I had heard a lot about this recently reated hotel  I was not dissapointed They have kept the historic charm but at the same time it looks very trendy and cool  The hallways and public areas are unlike most cookie cutter hotels  My room had a wonderful view of the lake and Fountain and while it  have been a little small it made up for it with a large stone entry cooridor and expansive bathroom with the largest showerhead I have ever seen  Healthclub was great as well very large with windows and VERY hi tech treadmills  Staff was friendly and helpful  Only issue was that room service was quoted as  min and took well over an hour   hotel was pretty busy  
P => You will definitely like the Blackstone I just finished a four night stay at the Blackstone and just thought it was great  The remodel came out great the room was very large and the staff couldnt have been friendlier I searched a number of places before iding on the Blackstone and it is close to a  star hotel but at a much better price The new lounge and restaurant on site are also excellent  The restaurant seems to be a hot spot for locals probably because its new and has received good reviews and that just makes the whole experience that much better I stayed with my brother and father Cubs weekend and we ended up with a room with two queen beds   which as it turns out means the room is even larger huge even and the roll away didnt make any difference  The room was great and my dad thought it was a suite it was so big Cant say enough good things  Im sure people can have bad experiences just like any hotel but the Blackstone itself is definitely a good call  
P => Expensive but wonderful I stayed at the Blackstone for a work related event  It was really beautiful  Very nicely restored  If you can try for the Lake View rooms  I had one and had an incredible view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier  There are fire works at Navy Pier on Wed and Sat and I got a great view of them from my window  The staff was   helpful to me  Definitely recommend it especially if its a business expense 
P => Wonderful Stay Just returned from a four night stay at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago and had a wonderful stay I called the hotel a few days before arriving and asked if I was able to take the quotElquot subwaytrain to the hotel  The concierge told me that I can take the Blue Line from OHare airport to the Jackson station and grab a cab and it would only be a few minutes from there  If you dont have too much luggage you can easily switch to the Red Line at Jackson and take one stop to Harrison and the hotel is only a couple of blocks away  Train tickets only cost  a person so it can be a very cheap way to get to the hotel  The train ride will take close to an hour  Once you get out of the Harrison stop just look up at the skyline  It is very easy to landk the hotel with its red exterior and distinctive green top  The hotel is located on the corner of S Michigan Avenue and Balbo As many have noted staff are very friendly and greet you as you enter and exit the hotel  Check in was quick and we were given a room on the th floor with views of Soldier Field the Field Museum Shredd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium  The hotel throughout is beautifully and tastefully orated  I particularly liked that the room had a little collection of books on Chicago  I thought it was a nice touch  The alarm clocks also had an ipod dock so you could listen to your ipod in the room  There is a coffee maker in the room and a Starbucks downstairs so there was no problems getting your morning caffeine  We were in town just in time for Taste of Chicago and it took place in Grant park so we were literally across the street from all the action  It was an easy walk to many of the cities attractions  We walked all the way down through Grant Park Millenium Park to Navy Pier through the Magnificent Mile and to the Hancock Building Everything exceeded expections except for Housekeeping  They provided lush and comfy bathrobes and I wanted some slippers so I called for some only to be told they were out  Daily housekeeping I found was inconsistent and didnt go as good as a job as I would have liked  But that is a minor complaint Overall this was a wonderful hotel and I would highly recommend  
P => Beautiful and friendly The hotel is beautifully elegant traditional yet contemporary  Staff greets you at the door upon entry and exit very helpful and accomodating  My room was immaculately kept room service responsive even thought it was a very busy week for downtown hotels  My only regret is that my wife was not there to share it with me  I had a great view of the lake and parks across the street and enjoyed one night of fireworks from the st floor  I did not eat in the restaraunt I opted for the Hilton across the street but wish I had tried it  The only thing lacking was shuttle transportation to McCormick Place but the HIlton provided that  You will not be disappointed with your stay I highly recommend it David Gulotta New Iberia Louisiana 
P => Very pleased  location non smoking new refurb etc       Thrilled with location  only about  blocks from the Red line  Being on the back of the hotel th floor the noise from the El was noticeable  Had the noise been constant it would have drifted into the background and been more white noise than anything  In fact it almost sounded like the ocean  But since the noise came and went with each train it seemed to stand out a little  I usually travel with a portable fan but didnt this time  Had I had it on I wouldnt have been bothered by the El noise  This wouldnt prevent me from staying here again  Id just be sure to bring my fan Room was confortable if a tiny bit small  The large bathroom and tiled foyer in the room made up for it  or in the room was excellent The walk in shower had a glass wall arating it from the rest of the bathroom  The wall wasnt long enough as a little water pooled on the floor Getting back to our room one day at about pm discovered that the room hadnt been straightened up yet  After a quick call to the front desk they apologized and sent someone up while we were out at dinner  Really was a non issue for us but wanted to mention it as example of how quickly the hotel staff responded Didnt eat on property as prices seemed excessive  Prefer to eat in the localfamily run places anyway  Would recommend this hotel to friends  
P => Blackstone excellence Superb service and staff excellent room comfortable beds excellent internet  what more is there to day 
P => PERFECT If youre looking for an eclectic modern spin on a historic hotel then this is the place for you Known as one of Al Capones favorites and completed in  this one is one from the movies On Michigan Avenue within walking distance of nearly EVERYTHING in Chicago  Valet was exceptional check in was a breeze  The on site Tapas restaurant was wonderful  Our room was orated to the quotTquot for a restored hotel  Tiled floors down comforters bright colors and EXTREMELY clean  Our view in the day was nothing to write home about but the night view of the Sears Tower and Hancock was SPECTACULAR The other side of the hotel would face Michigan Ave and the Lake so it would be even more beautiful  We loved every minute that we spent in our room almost as much as our Chicago experience itself Would recommend again and again and again Well be back 
P => Beautiful hotel but not without a couple of gripes Stayed here in the th il   Was extremely luck as the night we checked in we were informed it was the official opening and were treated to explore the hotel and sip champagne  In the ballroom we ended mingling with Chicagos high and mighty  After a good start it got even better  The room was beautiful fantastic bed flat screen tv and tastefully designed BUT as much as I dont want to fault The Blackstone I unfortunatley have to  I brought to attention  times the fact that our bedside lamps were not working and nothing was done it was not a big deal seeing as we were only staying  night but still after  complaints even an acknowlegment would have done for me   I think they should also reconsider their windows  We woke really early from the sounds of the morning rushhour and L train  I understand its downtown Chicago but I never had to wear earplugs in a hotel before  Again under the understanding of location and prices etc     I still thought that the breakfast in room was ridiculously over priced  It cost nearly  for two unspectacular omelettes and a pot of coffee  for the coffee alone and not as good as the Starbucks at the front of the hotel  There was not much choice on the menu either  Ironically I really enjoyed staying in the blackstone  All the staff were very friendy  The location is perfect for anyone visiting Chicago as you are right in the middle of all the action  Shopping is  mins left as you walk out the front door tourist trails and spots are right on your doorstep  The gym has all state of the art equipment with beautiful views from the th floor  A hotel that is steeped in history and class somewhere I would definitely stay again 
P => Awsome Hotel Before my stay I heard some bad reviews about this hotel and staff  Upon my arrival there was nothing but top notch care and pampering from every employee at this hotel  The hotel is breathtaking and in a perfect location to transit for anywhere in the city  The rooms are all done in modern time while the hotel is like going back in time with the ballroom to the lobby  while there I could just go back in time to think of all the festivities that happened there long ago  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Outstanding Hotel   lots of hostory wrapped in a brand new look Dont normally like to stay in older hotels but the Blackstone is a brand new old hotel  Lots of history wrapped in a brand new look  Rooms are completely redone and modern  Hotel staff was very friendly and attentive  The hotel gym was larger than most I have been in and had brand new equipment  The restuarant on the first floor is also very good if you can get in and dont want to go to far from the hotel  
P => Great new hotel with central location Just got back from  nights at the Blackstone  Room was excellent and spacious   ble floors in entry and bathroom flat screen tv high end furniture  Really the service is what makes the hotel stand out  You could not walk by any employee without them saying hi to you holding the door open etc I would highly recommend the hotel if you are planning to go to the museums  It is about a   minute walk through Grant Park to the Field Museum Aquarium and Planetarium but you cannot get much closer in terms of a hotel  The Art Museum is about a  minute walk also the other direction If you are taking the train into the city get off at the Van Buren Station and its an easy walk to the hotel you can use this same stop to get to the Science Museum  Otherwise parking is night at the hotel or around the corner on Wabash you can overnight for a little under    we didnt go this route but we walked past this cheaper garage on our way back to the hotel one day  
P => Wonderful gem with few rough edges Our stay at the brand newgreatly historic Blackstone was a terrific experience  The reations have been very well done adding contemporary furnishings and gadgets to the classic structure  Our only issues were with some service aspects which appear to be not well worked out yet such as housekeeping not servicing our room until  pm and a clump of valet parkers who ignored us we ended up in the Hilton lot across the street ginally less exhorbitant  The hotel has a great future building on a spectacular architectural treasure in a perfect location  
P => The Blackstone   New Chicago Landk The Blackstone So  Mich  Ave    Balbo next to the Hilton Chicago has been beautifully rehabbed and updated by riott as a Renaissance property  Having stayed there in  when it was independently managed the improvement is impressive indeed  Friends and I booked  arate rooms and all of us were more than satisfied   especially given we had senior rates  My large ble bathroom had a walk in shower with a rainfall shower head and top of the line amenities  The staff to a person is eager to please  The location is hard to beat being within walking distance of Millennium Park the Art Institute Orchestra Hall and the El  Theres an on site Starbucks and a Spanish themed bar and restaurant which while pricey features well prepared and imaginative food  Being as new as it is the staff really goes out of its way to make ones stay as pleasurable as possible  
P => Beautiful Reation Amazing Hotel Went to the Blackstone following their major reation and must say it has to be one of the nicest hotels in Chicago now  Classic finish with some modern touches  The lobby is beautiful and the meeting rooms including the famous ballroom are exquisite  The hotel rooms themselves are quite nice   flat screens cool wallpapering done in the bathrooms  I prefer this to the Drake anyday  I received a tour of the famous room where they held the Republica National Convention The Smoking Room I believe they called it which is going to be converted into a suite and is still under reation  Also got to see the meeting room downstairs that used to be a barbershop where Al Capone got his hair cut  The staff here are very friendly and they also just opened up an amazing tapas restaurant in the building as well  HIGHLY suggested for Chicago  
P => Tr s confortable tr s beau propre et bien situ     mais bruyant

P => Couldnt have asked for a better hotel experience My friends and I stayed at the Drake from    We came to see the Oprah show and we also spent the weekend shopping  We had such a great experience  The hotel staff was super friendly especially Tom shall at checkin  We were upgraded for free from a room with a king size bed to a room with  bathrooms and  oversized queen beds  The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a great visit  The hotel was clean and very nice and quiet considering the Lights festival was that weekend  The location of the hotel was perfect   ideal for shopping and enjoying the Mag  Mile  I highly recommend the Drake  
P => Great overnight stay  Great overnight stay at The Drake on   I reserved the room at a great price via Priceline  I sent the manager an email requested a reated room and he made it happen I was pleased with the follow through especially since we were paying a lower rate  Yes the rooms are a bit dated but that is by design  If you are looking for sleek and modern stay at W  Parking was a bit steep at  but that includes in amp out which we utilized to pack up at the end of the stay utnil we were done shopping  Overall great stay and I would recommend to anyone looking for a night away  
P => Perfect Getaway My wife amp I stayed at The Drake Hotel this past weekend for the first time and we were extremely satisfied with our experience  We were celebrating her birthday and I had notified the hotel of this a month before our arrival  Upon check in we were graciously upgraded to a ior Lake View suite and the desk staff member wished my wife happy birthday  Which came as such a surprise to my wife because she had no idea I even contacted the hotelThe room was dignified amp charming with the best view of Lake Michigan we had ever seen  The bed was meticulously made and extremely soft and comfortable  They also positioned the bed perfect in the room so you could gaze out all the wrap around windows in the suite We spent the day relaxing and enjoying the room since it was rainy outside  To top off everything we got a knock from room service and the hotel management had sent us up a dessert plate sparkling water amp birthday cake My wife was elated and it truly made us feel special We will definitely stay at The Drake Hotel again and I would recommend this hotel highly based on our experience  Also I am a Chicago native and you cant beat the location if looking to shop eat or hit nightlife  Everything is in close proximity 
P => excellent we spent  nights at the Drake and enjoyed a superb experience  The room was large andincluded a mini fridge  the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in simply luxurious Check in and check out was quick and the hotel staff were most courteous I will definetly stay there again when I visit Chicago  
P => Old and Tired Ive always wanted to stay at this hotel due to the reputation and location  We were celebrating our th anniversary and I booked the room online  We had reservations at a fancy Italian restaurant right across the street and I thought everything would be perfect  When we checked in I realized I should have splurged on a suite and asked if I could upgrade  The agent as if reading from a script said since I booked online she could not do that  I explained that it was our th anniversary and my wife was looking forward to a special weekend  She barely looked up and handed me a key to a room that had not been touched for at least  years The bathroom had chipped tile and dull ble  I was shocked at the state of the place  We spent as little time as possible in the room and tried to make the best of it  For   Ive stayed at nicer and more plush Hiltons or riotts  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone The doorman was very nice however  
P => Top Ratings Across the Board for this Very Top Hotel   THE BEST My friends and I were elated when we got tickets to the Oprah show but our stay at The Drake was the icing on the cake  The location couldnt be better    steps from Chicagos historic Water Tower the John Hancock building and all the fabulous shops and restaurants of the Magnificent Mile  The convenience factor was a saving grace for us as we were able to walk everywhere minimizing cab fares and could easily stop at the hotel to drop off shopping bags or relax between sites  Our two bathroom double queen room was perfect for the four of us  We especially appreciated the extra bathroom when we had to get up early and all prep at once for Oprah  I would imagine that the same room configuration would be perfect for a family    the room was so spacious that it even had a living room area and arate office nookEvery corner of the hotel exudes elegance from the spectacular floral arrangement in the lobby to the recently reated hallways and comfortable upscale rooms  The staff was welcoming helpful and polite  The saltwater taffys on our pillows were a nice touch If you want to make the most of your trip to Chicago stay at The Drake  It truly offers the best of everything  
P => Check out the room carefully My wife and I stayed in The Drake earlier this month  For the first couple of nights we had a room which could interconnect with two neighbours  Sound proofing is minimal and a group of tennagers arrived in the room next door  They  as well have been in our room  Sleep was impossible and the hotel completely failed to shut them up  Having relocated to a second room the following day the stay improved Gym and leisure services are basic  
P => velous Stay at The Drake My girlfriends and I recently stayed at The Drake Hotel during a visit to run in the Chicago athon  I had booked the room using Priceline and was thrilled when The Drake Hotel popped up as our hotel  However after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor I became a bit worried that we might end up in a small room needing reation  I emailed the manager Tom Thomas to request the best possible room during our stay  Within a few hours I received an email back from the Executive Assistant welcoming us in advance and assuring me that we would enjoy our stay  I kept my fingers crossed We arrived a bit early for our stay a and inquired about check in but the current guest had not checked out yet  We left our bags and went out for a bit  I called back at p and the clerk who politely remembered me said our room was now ready Upon entering the hotel you can truly feel the emphasis they put on luxury  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful from the front desk clerks to the concierge to the bell man  Everyone had a smile on their face and friendly things to say  The enormous flower display in the lobby fills the room with a lovely fragrance When we checked in to our room I could not have been more pleased It was an enormous room with two large beds and best of all two bathrooms  Perfect for three women The beds were incredibly comfortable with plenty of soft pillows and soft sheets  There was a large sitting area nice TV and even two large windows with a view  Everything was exceptionally clean and to a very high standard If you are considering The Drake Hotel I would suggest you book the hotel with confidence and simply email the manager to ensure your room meets your expectations  We were thrilled with our stay and will definitely consider The Drake Hotel for future visits to downtown Chicago  
P => Great Time I stayed here for several nights  Granted we didnt spend too much time in the hotel it was a great experience  I reccomend upgrading to the Executive Floors if you can  
P => exceeded expectations we live in Chicago but wanted a weekend to just quotgetawayquot and ive always wanted to stay at The Drake so he called and booked a weekend there a week before we went  We checked in around pm that friday after work of course to find that we were upgraded from our ior suite to an executive suite The hotel is a historic hotel a classic with old skool furnishings  It truly is a beautiful site to see for those looking to stay at a  modern  hotel this is NOT the place for you unless you can appreciate what some have called quotgrandma furnishingsquot in other reviews     The elevators have little couches in them which gave me a good lh and i forced us to sit down on them every time we were in the elevator alone no man in his right mind would do this publicly    Each design in the hallway all the way down to the room was so detail oriented you can tell the craftsmanship was of great quality  The hallways were nice and wide no need to struggle getting down as you pass others on the way to the room  The room was FANTASTIC It was a corner room with a lakeview  The parlor was huge with a couch armoire tv inside large desk and a table with  chairs  Then in the next room was the bedroom which had a king size bed that was SOFT and lovely full with at least  pillows  Next room was the bathroom which had ble stairs leading up to a jacuzzi tub that could probably fit  people in it a erate standing shower and a double vanity  It was def a spacious romantic room and we were pleased  Lots of towels available for use too big towels not the small ones that barely get around your body The only thing I noticed was that the TVs were very outdated had to at least be from early s as well as the telephones    however I can be see why as it keeps the quotold characterquot of the hotel intact  I can appreciate that kind of stuff esp when its creating the old Chicago feelLocation wise the Drake really is centrally located within the Mag Mile  Its one block north of the Hancock Tower and Water Tower Place with ample shopping a stones throw from the beach and a good walk to Navy Pier if youd really like We ate at the Drake Brothers Restaurant in the Drake every morning as it was part of our package  Without the package a breakfast buffet for  would cost  just to serve as an fyi  Some  say over priced but why would you expect anything less from a   star hotel The food was delicious with a wide variety to choose from Concierge service in the lobby was nice very informative to the people in front of us at least and was able to provide me with a bandaid when I asked for it   thanks AndreaI loved this hotel and would suggest it to anyone coming in for a visit that wouldnt mind splurging on a nice hotel   
P => good time at the drake We just got back from our trip to chicagostay at the drake  this was our first trip to chicago  we agree with most of the previous hotel reviews  a beautiful hotel with an incredible history  the lobby and upper restaurantbar are amazing and elegant  the food and service was great  we had one of our best meals at the Coq dor bar downstairs  we stopped for there for a drink almost everynight and they had live music every evening  that was wonderful  everyone that worked at the hotel was helpful and friendly  it is also a good location  right across the street from bloomingdales  macys is  blocks down the street and the john hancock building is next door  we only encountered two problems our entire stay   we prepaid for our hotel room  usd for an executive suite room th floor and it wasnt ready when we arrived at  pm  they said it wasnt cleaned yet and then a few minutes later they said they was a maintenance problem  so they put us on another floor in a smaller room with a lake view  which I felt was a down grade from what we had initially paid for  the next morning we went to complain and they did immediately without hesitation put us in the room we had previously requestedpaid for  the executive room was very large with a couchsitting area king bed desk and chair and  closets  we were very happy with the room  the private lounge was also very nice  it had a lake view   with a cold breakfast buffet included with the price I guess the main point I want to make is that PREPAID  PRESELECTED ROOMS DOESNT GUARANTEE you anything  I was under the impression that the room we had prepaid for would be held and ready for us upon check in   not the next day   my other problem is that my hotel room card was deactived the morning we were leaving  I left our room around  am and I couldnt get back into our room at  am  check out isnt until noon  luckly my husband was there to let me in  what if I was alone and stepped out for a second in my PJs   how embarrassing that could of beenoverall we enjoyed our stay  the rooms were very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable  if you appreciate history and elegance this is a great hotel  a must see p s  we give it a   instead of   due to the room issues we had  
P => Loved our stay at the Drake Hotel My husband and I traveled to Chicago for our th anniversary and stayed at the Drake Hotel after doing some searching for a great hotel at a reasonable rate  We received exactly the deal we were hoping for and more We took the train from Milwaukee and arrived way before check in time but they person at the desk said they gave us a free upgrade and were happy to keep our bags until the room was ready and even took our cell phone number so they could call  That worked out perfect as we were going to walk around the area anyway and were happy to have our bags taken care of  The location was within walking distance of restaurants shopping and Oak Street Beach     beautiful And anything else was just a short cab ride away  We went to the beautiful Palm Court for drinks after dinner and there was a great dance band playing that night  We had breakfast at the Drake Brothers with amazing views of Michigan Avenue and the lake  Our room was huge and had  walls with windows  Im sure it was one of the older rooms that hadnt been refurbished yet but it was beautiful none the less This is a beautiful historical hotel that should be on everyones quotgot to stayquot list  I hope they continue to offer specials for rooms at reasonable rates or we  have ended up at some run of the mill hotel chain and missed this wonderful experience 
P => Horrible NO HEAT NO HOT WATER The Drake greatly disappointed me  Valet lost my car and made me late to work  The rooms dont have heat until the temperature is below  in your room  The hot water is intermittent no hot water often during a shower  Management not interested in their problems  Trash in the hall ways  No wireless only ethernet  TV system is very dated doesnt work well 
P => Had a fabulous price   that made it a fantastic vacation We had the most incredible price and the front desk seemed a bit put out by the low price that we were paying  However they were the only ones who didnt seem overly friendly  The wait staff in the restaurant the staff at the lounge and the bellmen were wonderful  Our room didnt have a view of the lake but it was a very nice room and it almost seemed like suite with the entry sitting area and bedroom lay out  We had family in the area who came to have dinner with us and when we took their teen dhters up to see the room the  year old said it was like walking through Titanic  And that does seem like an accurate description of the old money feel in the or  We were going to go on line at the business center but the price seemed ridiculous and were Hilton gold  I thought we have had free use as this is part of the Hilton chain  
P => Dont miss the scary butler My kids got a complte hoot out of the scary butler whos outside the flower shopgift store on the ground floor  Hes motion activated and will speak when you come in Be sure not to miss it 
P => Great location in a historical gem  The Drake hotel in Chicago IL is a historical gem  We went in ust and got a great deal You cant beat the location right on the shore of Lake Michigan The hotel is steeped in tradition and is an old fashioned elegant hotel  If you like tradition then this is probably the hotel for you If you get a room with  beds they are kind of small  However the room was clean and the view was great  It was a peaceful hotel and the staff was pretty friendly  The hotel is surrounded by great shops and we loved the cafe downstairs  They also have tea time which is really nice  
P => The Drake is like home My wife amp I have visited the Drake twice in  years for a mini vacation  Since we rarely travel I was reluctant to go to another hotel because we know the Drake familiar territory  I have described it as a quotmiddlequot hotel not too expensive but not the cheapest either  i am amused by the complaints for different hotels and the mini bar prices etc  This is Chicago everything is expensive  The liquor is in fact cheaper or about the same in the min bar as in a regular bar not the Drake bar  The rooms could stand upgrading especially the carpets and the furniture  I feel a good portion of their income is from conventioneers lots of those going on  The hotel is beautiful in the lobby and the tea room service is great  They have a nice Espresso shop now and a neat art gallery and other shops  There is access to the beach right across the street if you are so inclined  The concierge has never steered us wrong yet and we used them a lot  We went out on my bday and he said just stroll over to Rush street and there are several places which we did  Great time too and very simple one block away  I have read reviews about the maids rattling in the linen closet but we stayed next to one a closet and it wasnt a problem  I also have read about problems with water pressure but ours was fine both trips Our view wasnt anything special but we didnt come for the view and I feel we could have specified one but the rate might have been more not sure  We didnt eat in the restuarants but did have a burger in the bar  The guys out front always remember us when we need a cab and are helpful  The bellhop took the time to point out features in the room for us which we knew already but it was nice  Finally did everyone notice the Manager commenting on negative reviews on this site I feel that is good follow up  We will probably go back again next year you can have a bad experience in any hotel  Our stays went very well  
P => A great hotel in a great city We could not have had a better time at the Drake  It is obvious that we were in one of the recently refurbished rooms because it was perfect in every way  The room looked out onto Lake Shore Drive and the lake  An unexpected bonus was being able to watch the professional volleyball tournament being played on the beach  We have stayed at the Drake several times in the past and have always gotten great service  This stay was no different  From the bellman to the concierge to the doorman to the front desk staff to the waiters in the restaurants the service could not have been better  The Coq dOr is one of my favorite bars in the world  The or is very romantic and the bartenders are very old school and lots of fun to talk to  We also had excellent breakfasts in the Drake Brothers Restaurant and a memorable dinner in the Cape Cod Room  The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was perfect  The bathroom was not large but it was very well maintained  We also loved the fitness center  It was complete with cardio weights etc  The common areas lobby and tea salon are very European and some of the most beautiful in Chicago  We have previously stayed here during the Christmas season and they had a huge Christmas tree and trains running through the lobby   incredible  We are already planning a return trip next ust  
P => A grand opulent hotel from the s that still struts its stuff well My wife and I recently stayed here for two nights as the base for our first real vacation in some time  I booked our room on Priceline com  and we were given a nicely reated room on the th floor  albeit with a fire escapecity view down to N  Michigan Ave  below  The room itself however was quite large and luxurious with a wonderful bed and bedding luxury toiletries in the bath and very nice or  However the real attraction here is the hotels public spaces from the well attended curbside reception area to the opulent lobby and Palm Court mixed use up a half flight from the lobby  There are many interesting nooks and crannies in this hotel and a very nice shopping promenade within  High Tea is served each afternoon in the Palm Court which was delightful and there is live music and dancing here in the evenings  A bonus they were serving  Dom Perignon by the glass in the Palm Court  Where have you ever seen this before This is our wedding year and we were surprised when we were presented with a complimentary chocolate torte dessert and half refill of the Dom when the staff heard this We were made to feel quite special by all the staff which is not at all the case in many mid tier chain hotels  Finally we had an excellent breakfast in the Drakes own restaurant opulent and fairly priced  We did not have any of the ancillary charges that seem the basis for many of the preceding less than stellar reviews  Overall we were simply delighted and hope to return soon to this ideally located grand old hotel 
P => HMM   if I had all the money in the world The Drake is a elegant hotel that you better bring your money too  The room we had was nice and elegant  We avoided the snacks and the mini bar since who can afford any of that  We never did eat at the Hotel since it was too price and not worth the value with so many restaurants near by  The Drake was nice to visit ONCE to say you have been but I find it hard to imagine a family staying there unless you are not concern about cost  In this economy who isnt  The location of the hotel is awesome  It is close to a lot of shopping and nightlife  Would I spend the money to go there again   NO  I will find a more modern hotel where I can lounge and enjoy a good breakfast and not just sleep there  
P => Wonderful Experience My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a Sunday night at the Drake in   The elegance of this property is the first thing that impresses you  The Palm serves tea every afternoon which is a great bonus  Upon our arrival we were professionally greeted and offered a room upgrade to a recently remodeled suite  The room  was clean spacious and tastefully remodeled  The best attribute of this room is that if overlooked North beach and had an amazing view of lake Michigan  We will request this room on future visits to The Drake  For dinner we were able to walk to Rush street and have a nice time at the Tavern of Rush  The walk was only three blocks so it was a perfect stroll there and back  In the morning we ordered the american breakfast from room service and it was excellent For lunch we walk on block south on Michigan avenue and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory which has a very nice outdoor seating area at the foot of the Hancock building  We shopped a bunch on Michigan ave and complete our stay in Chicago  We would recommend this trip to anyone for a refreshing romantic getaway  
P => Old School Elegance and Great Location Visited our friends who moved to Chicago and stayed down the street from them at the Drake for the weekend  The location of the hotel is fantastic   near great shopping the lake and wonderful restaurants  We were able to book a great rate   When we arrived early after our flight we were allowed to check in early but for a price additional   It was worth it to unpack and regroup  We had a handicapped room which was very spacious  The showertub combo was not ideal for us and had only a hand held shower head  While the room was very elegantly appointed it was showing signs of age   old floors and carpet window casings drapes etc  The bedding and towels were nice and pretty new  The furniture was nice and the tv was rather large and flat screened  The bar area of the Palm Court is just beautiful   had tea there on Friday afternoon and drinks later that evening  We had only one complaint   one afternoon after a long day walking around town we returned to our room and discovered both of our key cards would not work  We had to return to the front desk to get replacements and it was right as most folks were checking in  All we wanted to do was get inside and relaxThere are so many aspects of the Drake which reminded me of the Ritz in Paris including the shopping areas on the ground floor  If you are wanting a new and hip hotel this is not it  If you are traveling with children this isnt your place either  No pool no activities   really not a great place for kids  If you want to have a great weekend of shopping dining and exploring Chicago with another adult this would be a good choice  
P => Grand and Charming you will not be disappointed  Great location and view of Lake Michigan  We stayed at The Drake for our  year wedding anniversary in ust   The hotel is located just north of The John Hancock building on Michigan Avenue  The hotel is very grand and charming  They recently went through an extensive remodeling project and everything looks great  They even upgraded our room because of our anniversary  Our room was perfect and overlooked Lake Michigan  You can walk out the front door of The Drake and you re at Lake Michigan  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  We were greeted curbside by Ben with a smile  He helped us unload our luggage and was very friendly  We used the parking garage a few doors down on Walton  It was less expensive than the hotel parking  a day verses   The location is perfect and you re walking distance to the entire down town attractions  You can also grab the red line which is close by on Chicago Ave  The buses work out well too  We took the Michigan Ave Museum Campus Bus to Shedd Aquarium  The historic hotel is packed with stories  The book inside your room tells a lot about the hotel especially the history  The Cape Cod Lounge is really neat because it s basically the same as it was in the  s  The bartender was very knowledgably about the history of the Cape Cod Lounge  Ask him to look at the  MM  that Joe DiMaggio carved into the bar for his wife ilyn Monroe  The Gold Coast Room and the Palms Room are very elegant  You will not be disappointed with The Drake  
P => All you can expect   is there  Just one word spectacular  The Staff classy and serviceable  All tops  
P => Okay but not great  I stayed at the Drake for  nights  The service was friendly and its not a bad locatiion but way too salty for what you get  Actually Chicago is the quotsecond cityquot for a reason it just cant hold a candle to New York  One bright spot was the Rosebud Steakhouse just down the street excellent restaurant  
P => Faded   but great location and great value The Drake should be a world class hotel as it has so much going for it  Location is the best in Chicago   opposite Bloomingdales near Rush Street overlooking the beach  It has history and a definate sense of granduer  That said it is now looking a bit tired  The public areas are OK but the rooms have a little wear and tear but are still certainly very acceptable  Service is also a bit surly at times  That said the price seems to reflect this  We paid about  per night for a ior suite  To me this is excellent value  We tend to stay in more expensive places than the Drake   but the location and style of the Drake make it our regular stop in Chicago  
P => Updated Elegance The Drake is a lovely historical hotel in Chicago  Recently reated the hotel looks fabulous  My room was very comfortable with a great bed a big bathroom and windows that opened allowing for some fresh air on the first nice day of spring  The staff is very professional and gracious  In the lobby a harpist plays music in the afternoon during tea  A very nice touch for those who enjoy this type of service  There is a great coffee shop in the ground floor that I recommend for breakfast or lunch  The location is excellent as well  
P => No service no manners no style   relying on its historyformer reputation We arrived at midnight on Thursday still here but only because prepaid  Bed had not been changed from previous occupant   pubic hairs etc in the bed no top sheet  Informed front desk  Informed them again after  minutes and no sign of anyone  Maintenance man came to see what the problem is  Came back  minutes later with sheets which were in fact duvet covers  Told the duty manager the next morning  No apology no statement of embarrassment   nothing  I would highly recommend NOT staying here  
P => Beautiful hotel resting on its laurels As a Hilton Gold VIP HHonors member for the past few years I generally have been very happy with the serivice I have received from the various Hilton hotels in Chicago New York City Washington D C and San Diego  I was looking forward to staying at the Drake we had visited the hotel in the past for dinner and drinks  Unfortunately after my recent stay I doubt I will go back again  We travel there at least     times a year so weve stayed at several comparable hotels and know that Chicago has many other options The Pros  Wonderful location You are a close walk to Mag Mile Gold coast and River North shopping and dining  Lincoln Park is a short    minute   cab ride drive away  The Oak Street Beach is within walking distance for running   Terrific conferencecatering services The food and service was wonderful during our meeting  The staff in catering was professional and very accomodating this further highlighted the discrepancies in service in all other areas please see below  I definitely would return to the Drakerecommend it to others for their meetingcatering facilities   Beautiful lobby bar and dining areas barrestaurant staff professional and prompt   Heavenly Beds and linens were extremely comfortable  some of the best hotel beds I have slept in recent memory LaSource bath amenities also are very nice  Room was very clean althought the carpetupholstery was a bit worn The Cons  As a Gold VIP HHonors member I requested an upgrade  I have never had issues with this request which is a part of being a member at other hotels i e  Hilton Gaslamp San Diego Chicago Conrad Millenium Hilton NYC    terrific service in this regard  I was told that I could not be upgraded to an Executive level room because quotthey were not availablequot yet other folks in our conference party who were not HHonors members did get rooms on the Executive floors  In addition since I didnt require a complimentary breakfast I asked twice if there was any way I could receive complimentary internet instead  I was told this was not possible unless I quotdowngradedquot my room which seemed unreasonable since the room I was in was on a lower floor    th floor    with only a partial lake view but a great view of the heating vents  I was told I could speak with Hilton HHonors customer service  The customer service representative contacted the manager Tom Thomas but I never received the courtesy of a response  I really would have liked to opportunity to make what I thought was a small request free internet versus an executive floor upgrade   Cleaning staff On two consecutive mornings the cleaning staff entered my room    AM without checking to see if I was still there  Luckily I am an early riser    Front desk staff seemed professional enough but clearly not particularly warm amenable to moving beyond the cursory motions of helping see above  They also made an error of charging me for a mini bar item when I had not taken anything from it  They reluctantly removed the charge  Overall the Drake has many great qualities  It is a beautiful hotel in a great location with wonderful facilities and a terrific catering staff  in addition the rooms are clean and the beds are terrific  Unfortunately the front desk staff lack of response from the General Manager despite my attempts to contact him and the lack of basic courtesies as a Hilton HHonors member left me a bit perturbed  I do hope that the Drake can rectifiy these issues  Until they do I would look elsewhere first at other hotels in the area i e  Hotel Burnham or Monaco Hotel Intercontinental Historic tower Swissotel Conrad  
P => Couldnt be Better The Drake really has it all   youre across the street from Oak Street beach can walk to many great rstaurants John Hancock is  blocks away Service was impeccable room was very nice   paid extra for a Lakeview the lobby amp restaurants were all so grand Thought also quite economical   considering all you received Look forward to staying again It was a   
P => Great Historic Hotel A group of us stayed at the Drake Hotel over a weekend in il  It is a great historic hotel  If you stay here you should be because you like historic hotels not because you want ultra modern  The rooms are nicely appointed but you can tell it is a historic hotel  The lobby is beautiful and has some interesting nooks and crannies  The breakfast brunch buffet is also very good and a ent value  The location is also great making it an easy walk to get anywhere in the city  I would stay here again the next time I am in Chicago  
P => The more you pay the less you get  This is the quotfanciestquot hotel that I have ever stayed in and I was expecting much more  I was told that all the bathrooms had erate tubs and showers but when I got there that was not the case  I paid for a king room with a small sitting area and they were not kidding when they said small  It was actually one chair and a small table in front of the window  Nothing special  The bed was the best thing about the room but there werent any sheets to sleep under  Just the comforter  No phonebook in the room no pool no free breakfast and the prices for the mini bar were outrageous  I mean really   for a snickers My sister in law paid   for an individual kid size box of cereal and some milk  The self parking was full so we had to park down the street in another parking garage which ended up being cheaper  Basically we paid for the bed and the name  When my parents went to Chicago they stayed at the Holday Inn and had better reviews  Unless you are just looking for a good nights sleep I would not recommend this hotel for the money  Also they did not offer us any transportation suggestions except when we asked about the red line  They told us that it was seven blocks away and gave us a map of how to get there  The Holiday Inn offered to shuttle my parents to the Navy Pier when they asked about it  One more thing we got stuck in a room that was  a night with the ice maker right outside in the hallway and the rooms have metal ice buckets  Lets just say they tend to make more noise when the ice is dropping compared to a plastic bucket  
P => My Chicago Favorite Grande old dame of Chicago    my favorite hotel lovely staff impeccable brilliant foodstuffs all in all one of the best in the nation  
P => A true classic If you can   stay at the Drake  This place can be expensive but I got a good price and I am glad that I did  The hotel is just amazing inside  You will feel like you have walked into a different era when you enter  The rooms are smallish but normal for Chicago  The service is spectacular   this is the standard against which other hotels should be judged  Bottom line   if you can get a good price stay here  If you cant get a good price but everything in Chicago is expensive then stay here and at least enjoy the cost  If you cant stay here then stop by and walk through the lobby so that next time you visit you will know where to stay  
P => Classy Historic Hotel great hotel in the North Michigan Mile area  you can walk to Navy Pier and Chicago Riverwalk about a mile hike and then a little further than that is Millenium Park  Bed is very comfy  Toilet is nice with super flush Shower has good water pressure  CFL bulbs in lighting fixtures to help save energy  Concierge is very knowledgable  Very close to a local beach about  blocks away  
P => Beautiful Historic Hotel Stayed at The Drake for  days in ember  We got a last minute deal on the internet an extremely ent rate considering it was Christmas time  The hotel is beautiful particularly during the holidays  Large Christmas trees orate the lobby and there are carrolers walking around singing  The rooms are pleasant  High ceilings an entertainment armoir  The bathrooms are spacious and clean  The location is at the north end of Michigan Avenue   very convenient to tourists visiting for the holidays  For visitors in the summertime the Oak Street beach is across the street  
P => Good Value   Nice Staff   Enjoyed our stay We got a Super deal from hotwire at first I was concerned because of the other reviews on tripadvisor but it was a great stay  The location of the Drake is awesome if you are coming for shopping and to see the North Shore  It is a little ways from downtown a few blocks from the red line The first room we received had a nice view of the wall so we asked for an upgrade and got a beautiful room with a lake view for the rest of our stay  The first room had some peeling wallpaper in the bathroom and the toilet was in a strange location plus the air conditioner popped and banged  Overall the first room was a nice size not small The second room with the lake view was nice and quiet and LARGE  The bed was large and soft  The pillows were really nice as well  It came with a coffee maker full sized ironing board and iron along with a hair dryer and a safe  I have to say that they must put   of their attention and money into the lobby because it is beautiful but the rooms really aren t as regal as you d think they might be  Don t get me wrong they were nice but if they were as nice as the lobby I would give this hotel  stars  It appeared that the guest rooms were sort of an afterthought The desk staff was nice and accommodating If we hadn t received a screaming deal from hotwire I m not sure it would be worth the standard rate  
P => Rooms need updating big time Definitely a Chicago classic with arguably one of the best locations in the city  We came in for a wedding rates were still about  a night with group discount  I hadnt been here since my H S  Prom in   The lobby and common areas are still elegant and classic  Staff is efficient and professional Room was really dirty dumpy and needed updating big time  Carpet was seriously  years old and needed to be replaced  Bed was OK TV was an old POS  I really expected more but I was willing to sacrifice for the rest of the place The wedding was great cant remember which room but it was awesome  Food was good and the service was stellar  If youre thinking about having a wedding here your guests will not be disappointed 
P => A truly classic hotel with very helpful and friendly staff Given The Drakes reputation and having read some reviews on this site we were unsure whether we should be excited or not  We were bowled over with the quality of the hotel the helpful staff and the tastefully orated room  We have stayed in many places in many countries and would rate The Drake as one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had  
P => What a treasure We so enjoyed our trip to Chicago and the Drake   everything is just beautiful   its lavish lobby and cozy rooms   the bar and tea time are wonderful as well  The Drake is truly a gem to the Chicago area and I recommed it to all guests who can afford to stay there  Its not cheap   but it is memorable 
P => Great Deals right now I am a suburban Chicago resident and had a last minute invite to a conference at the Drake  Since we were meeting for early breakfast we ided to come down the afternoon before and live it up a bit The hotel did not dissappoint but i was upgraded upon arrival to the th floor  Our room was very nice in all respects but I did hear other attendees complaining of room size  I didnt have the heart to tell them my internet rate was better than the attendee rate but that is the nature of last minute booking  sometimes you win and sometimes you sleep in the carI enjoyed the or the staff and the check inout  Some hotels are operating on such skinny staffs that it is noticeable  This property had good staffing for the guests and even better for the conference services My only heartburn came from something the Drake has no control over  our ors quotrevenue eyesquot with regards to fleecing the tourists  I would happily make   more overnight trips to Chicago every year and actually buy something on the Mag mile if the tax add ons didnt make me so foul mooded and ornery  ors office are you listening Olympic organizing committee are you 
P => favorite hotel in chicago This hotel is fantastic Close to everything beautiful  Attentive staff  Rooms well appointed and prices very reasonable  
P => Fulfilled a dream but at what a price My first trip to the Drake was  years ago when a college friend and her boyfriend picked me up in his Rolls and took me to the Drake for Sunday brunch  I was wowed then and I told myself that some day I would stay at the Drake  I have made many trips to Chicago over the past  years but somehow never stayed at the Drake  One of my professional societies had its annual meeting in Chicago this past week so I ided that this would be the time to do it  The location is in my favorite part of Chicago  Excellent shopping is at your doorstep  On the downside it is pretty far away from McCormick Place  Even with the express bus lanes you had to count on a minimum of half an hour travel time to the conference  I had requested a king sized bed and got it  The bed was really very comfortable  There were extra pillows in the closet along with a blanket that was useful  The room was extremely warm when we arrived  When we activated the ventilation system it turned the air conditioning on and it stayed on the entire time we were there  We were comfortable but it made us question what was going on to make the place so hot Our room was on the th floor on the Michigan Avenue side and we did not experience any problems with noise  The blackout shades did an excellent job of darkening the room as well as keeping it quiet  The staff are absolutely outstanding  They really bent over backwards to help us  We did do the high tea on a Sunday afternoon meeting some British friends of ours who had been relocated to Chicago  They brought their infant twin girls along since we had not seen them  The staff were incredibly accommodating about finding us a place where we could park the monster stroller and providing high chairs and then taking pictures  Their willingness to help really helped me when I paid the bill for tea scones little sandwiches and some sweets   including tip  So I check quothaving high tea at the Drakequot off my list of things to do before I die  The thing that really irritated me the most was the incredibly poor internet service  No wireless internet service was available in the rooms  The land line service was incredibly expensive and incredibly poor It had intermittent failures every hour for five to ten minutes where it could not connect  And then suddenly it would reconnect  I could never get a satisfactory answer for why this occurred  It was maddening because I spent more in my four days at the Drake than what I spend in a month at home on my high speed internet connection  They are not oriented to business travelers who want to work from their room The Drake is an institution  As our British friends mentioned this was the place that the Royal family stayed when they visited Chicago  I put it in the same category as the Plaza in New York as it once was  It is an experience to have had but not necessarily a habit to acquire  I look fondly on the experience but the next time I am in Chicago I will find one of the better value hotels  
P => The Drake Fading Beauty I have stayed at the Drake  times in the past  years  Typically using Hilton Points Im a platinum member  The rooms have varied tremendously from tiny boxes to beautiful suites overlooking Lake Michigan  This last stay they put me on nd Floor quotoverlooking Michigan Avequot  In reality I could hear the traffic from Michigan Ave all night  If you are a light sleeper forget it ROOMIn serious need of upgrading  Old carpeting small bathrooms and tiny TV  Desk work area was very small LOCATIONThe location at end of Michigan Ave is nice  Easy walk for good shopping and access to run path along the lake EXTRASThe executive lounge has gone done in terms of food offerings as well as quality of food  On a Saturday morning only two newspapers for room of about  guests  No newspaper delivered to room  The fruit bowls they had by elevators on each floor are a thing of the past  Overall its a nice hotel but definitely has seen better days  If money s not an object then Park Hyatt or Peninsula are much better choices Using Hilton points consider the Conrad Hotel 
P => Grande Dame of Chicago Hotels My dhter and I spend  days at the Drake in Chicago  What a fantastic hotel  I was surprised when it came up on the bidding site particularly at the rate I bid  Check the bidding for travel sites for more info  Arrived and parked across just across Michigan Ave for  for  hours and checked in hotel valet is very expensive as is standard at this level hotel in Chicago  The self park is   Go across the street Front desk staff moved us into a two twin bed room on a refurbished floor and were generally friendly and helpful  The lobby is phenomenal a piece of another age  The room was more pedestrian It faced Walton Pl and was on the small side not tiny just small  We had a huge flat panel tv and an internet connection  day but there is wireless from somewhere else for   a day if you are a cheapskate  Beds were comfy and the bathroom small but the shower was divine Just the ticket after a long cold walk on Michigan ave  We did not eat at the hotel as there are many options close up on Rush and State streets  Great place for breakfast is the Original Pancake House  Bell staff kept our bags efficiently after we checked out  Overall a great stay at a great hotel  
P => Grand and elegant old hotel I am in Chicago frequently and generally stay at the Drake even though my meetings are in other hotels scattered around the downtown  I have been staying at the Drake for longer than I care to remember  I will keep coming back as long as they continue to maintain this elegant grande lady  The staff is tops the place is clean and it has some elegant history  Sure the Fairmont is nicer but sterile with little history  Just take a few minutes to wander around late at night and you can just feel the stories oooz out of the walls  I just like to sit in the lobby for a few minutes before heading to the airport   it is so quiet and elegant  I hope the managers keep their careful eyes on this hotel as I would hate to have to give it up  Just one minor issue   the internet is expensive and slow for business purposes  and not wireless  
P => Definitely a mixed bag  My wife and I stayed at the Drake over a weekend in ruary  There were some very good aspects and some very disappointing ones First the good ones We had a room on the th floor overlooking Lake Michigan  It was a beautiful view The room was large and nicely furnished   The Drake Brothers restaurant was excellent for breakfast   great food and great service  And we got a  per person voucher for being Diamond members  Yes you do need the whole  each The location of the hotel is great  In addition to the view you can easily walk to many shops and restaurants  You dont need a car to experience this part of Chicago  We took a cab from the airport   After our two days at the Drake we simply walked across the street to the Hertz location at the Westin and rented a car for the rest of our trip  That allowed us to avoid the  per day parking fee  There are several great shops in the hotel  The Mangel Florist shop provided a small bouqet of beautiful red roses for only   There was an art gallery with beautiful paintings and a very freindly owner  Dont miss the Lavazza Coffee Shop in the shopping area of the hotel   great coffee super friendly service translated not snooty   see below awesome sandwiches and a relaxing atmosphere And now the disappointments The executive lounge is closed until quotlate chquot due to quotlack of businessquot  So definitely dont pay extra for a room on the executive floor hoping to use the lounge  As noted above the substitute breakfast vouchers work well for breakfast  But check your bill   we were charged for breakfast the first day  The lobby area is undergoing reations and much of it is covered with scaffolding and giant sheets of plastic  I notice thats disclosed on their website now but wasnt when I made my reservation  The Palm Court Lounge was a disappointment on Saturday afternoon  We did not feel welcome at all and the staff was quite snooty  We got up and left and had a wonderful time in the Lavazza Coffee Shop  Id recommend the same choice for others  Check your bill closely  We were charged for breakfast one day when it should have been free and were also charged for some mini bar items  And that was before I even realized there was a mini bar  The bathroom was small and in need of updating  I guess at the end of the day an old hotel is still an old hotel While Im glad we had the experience of staying in this landk hotel we probably wont be back  
P => Loved it I need to come back Stayed at The Drake at the end of a business trip  It was fantastic Located in downtown Chicago just  block away from the John Hancock Building next to Lake Michigan  You could see the beauty of the hotel even though a large part of it was being restored to its s glory  The staff were extremely friendly knowledgeable amp nice  The rooms were fantastic amp beautiful A regular room is like a mini suite The bed was comfortable too  I need to come back here once the hotel is completely restored  I would recommend it to anyone  
P => The Drake LuxuryService Stayed at the Drake just for the weekend for a quick getaway in Chicago knowing that the weather would be horrible snow amp cold Check in went great  Due to low occupancy front desk gave us a free ugprade to the executive level  Normally this gives you access to the executive lounge for cocktails and breakfast however due to the low occupancy rate the lounge was closed  I did ask if there was anything else we could get instead and the front desk gladly gave us two free breakfasts at Drake Brothers  Pretty good deal so farRoom was great  Very large with four closets We couldnt remember where we put everything we brought  All the restaurants at the Drake are very nice  Cape Cod Room is our favorite for seafood  Drake Brothers is a steakhouse however they do have a very nice breakfast buffet  Coq DOr is their small loungerestaurant where we had lunch  It was very good also  The Palm Court is their other quotbarquot however is also the tea room  They have afternoon tea while a harp plays  It is always very crowded  We went in the evening where they have jazz and it had loads of dancers and was quite crowded also  That evening we ided to try the new Trader Vics which has just opened up after being closed for two years prior at the Palmer House Hotel  It is just a three block walk from the Drake by Rush St  It was pretty good however service was spotty and the food was just so so  That being said they have a great lounge serving fabulous Mai Tais so it is good for cocktails and hors doeuvres for sureWe have stayed at the Drake previously and always love their ambiance and great service along with excellent gold coast location  I would recommend it to all looking for an upscale lodging offering good restaurants and service  
P => Still a classy place to stay Booked our stay at the Drake on Hotwire so I didnt know we were staying here until after Id paid got an excellent deal though   over   off the going discount rate  I was a bit skeptical about it after reading through the reviews but thanks to you all knew the potential pitfalls When we checked in I asked for a room on a reated floor  The clerk asked me if I wanted one bed or two and I asked for one  As shes figuring out which room to put us in she says quotOh well youre not only getting a reated room youll be the first people to stay in it quot We also got upgraded to a lake view room  No complaints there The front desk staff was very polite on the several occasions we visited them As stated in a lot of the other reviews the concierge staff was extremely helpful as well  They booked our dinner reservation as well as helping us get two spa appointments at the same time on a Saturday morning with only a couple hours notice My only complaint is about the parking   its valet only and its expensive  Just be aware of that if youre driving in  We stayed for one night and the parking charge was  Your best bet would be to find a self park garage in the area   realistically you shouldnt pay more than  per day to park so at the very least youre saving almost  if not more  Still its a great location right on Michigan Avenue near all the shopping youre within walking distance of the Rush St  nightlife and when the weathers nice youre right across the street from the beach and the lakeshore  Definitely glad we stayed here  Would stay here again 
P => A Great Experience We stayed here over the New Year period  and experienced their New Year Ball a lovely black tie event  The hotel service was excellent and the elegance and age was just what we hoped for  Its location is also superb for a stay in the city  We walked everywhere and no walk was too long Our room faced the front South which was fine if uninspiring though the rooms facing North offer spectacular views of the coast  I found the hotels bar ordinary and expensive there are better ones just around the corner Try the Grill on The Alley for a great meal and a wonderful bar I believe there is a major refurb planned for    
P => Grand Old Hotel The Drake is realy one of those timeless hotels  Even though it is dated in age and now one of those chanes that tend to strip all personality from a hotel The Drake Stands out  Its location is superb right at the tip of lake michigan and Michigan Ave  The food is great somewhat pricy but the Cape cod room is worth it  The atmousphere is splendid  It was the first time I took my now fiance home from Ireland and it was perfect  I can not compliment them more on the quality  I am in the hotel industry and I tend to be picky  I dont think this quite makes one of The worlds top type hotels but as far as a not about to spend a grand a night hotel it is top of the league  
P => Fabulous Drake Lavish but not overdone this hotel makes the average person feel like a member of royalty if only for the night  Wide hallways and rich elegant d cor add to the charm and old world luxuriousness of this grand old hotel  Great dining and even good shopping choices make this one of Chicago s most elegant palaces  I ve stayed at the Palmer House and the Ritz Carlton  Both are great but The Drake tops them hands down  
P => Better than expected given reviews I was looking to stay here on pleasure but thought Id wait till experiencing on business given the relatively lower rating given the reputation of the hotel  I must say at Christmas time the hotel is beautifully orated and majestic  The rooms are a bit outdated but its a historic hotel  Carpet a bit dungy is my only complaint  Bedding and comfort are top notch  Service I find very good  Id search for internet discount rate as this hotel is only worth  a night tops compared to what youd find at Sofitel or Affinia for comparison of updated room and arguably better or same service  
P => Refurbished perfection My latest visit to this grande dame hotel allowed me to see first hand how the reations are coming along  I had a ior suite on one of the revovated floors and the results are fabulous  Everything brand new but the old flavor of the hotel still remains  Our room had two very large flat screen tvs great bath completely restored woodwork detailing and a tremendous view of Lake Michigan  All of the old details of the hotel were perfectly restored allowing none of the old character to be lost  I do not know why anybody would stay any place else other than this place  The Palm Court was absolutely hopping on the weekend with great jazz music and dancing and the timeless feel and elegance are just so palpable They are redoing one floor at a time so make sure you ask for a room on one of the reated ones  
P => Finally got there Stayed at the Drake during the first week in ember in fact arrived Chicago just a day too late to celebrate Obamas victory  I once worked in Chicago and have been back a few times but somehow never got to stay in this wonderful timeless landk   until the opportunity presented itself to whisk my partner away for  days  It did not disappoint  The ior lakeview suite was spacious classy comfortable and well equipped   the bed was to die for the quotHH Collectionquot topper douvet and Egyptian cotton sheets now rival Sofitels in my opinion  Heating was a little on the lowuncontrollable side and the bath and bathroom incredibly small for a suite  And forget watching TV from the bed   you will need the eyes of an eagle until the Drake goes widescreenAlthough the d cor looked just a little tired this hotel has class real class  Chicagos  great  answer to the London Savoy or the Ritz or indeed the Chicago Ritz  Our only complaint was that front desk and bar staff were OK just OK  This is where the Drake lost one star for us  Concierge and bell team were however humorous helpful and very prompt   The Drake is still steeped in nostalgia and stories where else can you rest your cocktail where Joe DiMaggio carved ilyn Monroes initials on the bar  So I reckon this hotel is still the only place to end up after lugging your Saks and Bloomies shopping bags down the Magnificent Mile 
P => Nostalgic Hotel The Drake is a nostalgic hotel located just a block from the Water Tower  The lobby is beautiful and continues to hold the grace of which has made it famous  There are breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and a myriad of upscale boutiques  The hotel Christmas tree was erected in the middle of the lobby during my stay and was absolutely gorgeous surrounded by animated Santas and angels flying overhead  During lunch in the Palm Court restaurant a harpist played adding a bit of magic to the overall ambiance  Overall the rooms were nice and clean  One bit of information for Hilton Honors guests that difers from other HIlton properties is that you must be booked in an executive suite in order to be allowed onto the concierge level  no matter if you are Diamond VP or not  Although it did not impact my stay I found it interesting  Overall a great stay  
P => The Drake  Classy Chicago  I have just returned from The Drake  I stayed there for a wedding this past weekend  I loved this hotel  Very elegant  Just walking through the lobby is amazing  Hotel has a wonderful charm  Service was excellent  Staff very helpful  It is in great location Plenty of restaurants  A harpist plays during the tea hour near the lobby Just an amazing hotel  Best wishes    yRichmond VAAt Drake hotel      
P => Classic Chicago The Drake is a classic Chicago hotel  Best location on Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Ave this hotel has it all  The hotel has never been ruined with some sort of modern update  Has a classic and logical feel with great rooms and character The lobby is wonderful and drinks by the fountain are a must for an elegant experience at this classic hotel  
P => Time for a reation While the Drake is an classic old hotel it is long past its prime  The lobby is still very elegant but the rooms are long in need of reation routine maintenance has been deferred too long  Old carpets with stains peeling wall paper dirty windows  Great location  I have stayed here twice for business meetings our group is not coming back  They seem to have problems getting people the rooms they had booked  
P => A Wonderful Experience I have had the good fortune to stay at the Drake each of the last three years and Ive had excellent experiences each time  The common areas of the hotel are wonderful  The furnishings and or make you feel as though you could be sitting in the lobby a century ago  Its great to have tea or appetizers in the bar and just watch people come and go  There are several dining options and though Ive heard that Drake Brothers is great for dinner Ive only ever eaten breakfast there  The breakfast is wonderful though   you can have the buffet or ala carte  Ive been to a few banquets and business meetings at the hotel as well and the food is always better than you would expect for that kind of thing so I think you can safely give the catering service high ks  Over the years Ive stayed in three different room types   a city view suite a city view double and a lakeview king  The suite and king were both great  I will say that the city view double was showing its age but I figure that is to be expected at a grand old hotel  If you want trendy new furnishings and plasma televisions go stay at a new hotel  If you want history grandeur and tradition stay here  Youll also get REKABLE service which I think is the best reason to stay here  Ive always had great service at check in and check out with both the bellhop and front desk staff the housekeeping service is great the room is always spotless and the concierge cant be beat  She was able to get tickets to some very hot shows the day of and got great seats  Some folks have complained about the location   saying that its not central enough  Admittedly it is at the end of the magnificent mile rather than in the middle but I think the lake view and the proximity to some of the higher end boutiques on Oak Street are the perfect complement to the hotel  Also some of the best restaurants Spiaggia etc are within a block or two  For the overall package of location room or and GREAT service I really dont think the Drake can be beat  
P => Very Nice My husband and I stayed at The Drake Hotel for  nights in tember  It was the best time to see Chicago because the crowds were minimal  As for the hotel        it is super fancy and the or is AMAZING They had fresh flowers in the lobby and the design was fantastic  The staff were extremely professional and approachable not like in Ontario  The only things that we were not impressed about were the extra charges  If you want to use the fitness center and it is tiny there is a fee for it  The internet must be bought even if you bring your own laptop  With the amount of money that we paid or would have paid if we didnt use hotwire com you would think they would include the above items at no extra charge  But    overall it was a very nice stay  I would not pay the  that the room was advertised for but if I could get another deal I would stay there again  
P => Gorgeous hotel   great rates available if you look in the right place We booked this on Hotwire and what a pleasant surprise  In the middle of summer we got a room for  and then when we arrived at about pm on the day of check in we were given a free upgrade and ended up in a suite with two queen beds and two bathrooms a sofa and armchairs and two tvs   it was HUGEWe really got to enjoy being in the city centre and at the head of the Magnificent Mile  The people at the hotel booked us onto an architecturesightseeing cruise the next day and we really had a wonderful stay in the city thanks to the Drake This hotel is highly recommended and the location is perfect  The staff were all courteous and there is loads of history to read about connected to the Drake If you get a good deal on this place it is a real treat 
P => Beautiful Hotel convenient location The Drake Hotel is an excellent choice for anyone interested in staying along the Magnificent Mile  We arrived at the hotel about am and were very pleased when we were upgraded to a jr  suite and immediately given our room keys  Our room was very large and very beautifully orated  The hotel is convenient to all of the best shopping as well as the Oak Street Beach area which was fun to visit as well  My only complaint was that there was no where particularly close to walk to and grab a cup of coffee but this was a small price to pay for such a beautiful hotel and location I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Great Location Grand Hotel Great location on velous mileThe Drake has retained its charm and character with a recent room reation My room was large recently reated clean and quiet  Hallways were well lit I didn t have any of the problems noted in some other recent reviews  I was on a non smoking floor the furniture and linens were obviously new  
P => Perfect for a family weekend My husband and I brought my mom to the Drake in ch of  to celebrate her th birthday  The great thing about The Drake during the winter is youre able to get fantastic rooms for unbelievably reasonable prices  I believe our two club level rooms overlooking Lake Michigan were less than  a night The rooms were de rigeur for the Drake   well appointed and ample in size  We love staying at the Drake for the quotold Chicagoquot feel we always get but are always shocked back into Hilton reality when it comes to service  Most of the Drake employees always seem rather put out and the biggest example was when the three of us rather than venture out into the freezing snow opted to have dinner and drinks in the Palm Court  Our waitress literally had a scowl on her face every time we asked her for something  Im not a travel snob but Im never a fan of servers just being downright rude to people who actually are quite nice and friendly  The tip we left reflected our dissatisfaction But we dont go to the Drake for the service we go for the history and the fun and the location on Michigan Avenue  
P => Totally eiving There are so many problems with this hotel its not even funny  First the rooms are horrendous  Theyre lime green with wallpaper from the s  Not at all what you see on the website  Its like checking into the Four Seasons and then staying in a room at the Motel   The room that they show on their website is one of their suites not one of their standard rooms  Second guest service is rude and pointless  Im not just talking about the people behind the desk  Im talking all across the board  The parking attendants  The restaurant servers  The managers  My wife and I couldnt believe it  For example when we checked in they put us in room    Thats on the first floor on the corner of Michigan Ave  amp Lake Shore Drive  It is so loud Its a room that shouldnt even be offered to guests  So we asked if we could switch rooms and instead of giving us another room they asked if we would rather check out I asked if the hotel was sold out that evening  They said no  Huh So the hotel is not sold out you have a comparable room available but you wont let us switch It was only after asking for the manager that they put us in a smoking room  And besides the horrible smell it was just as ugly and old looking as the first room  Very nice people My advice to anybody traveling to Chicago who wants to stay in a nice hotel on Michigan Ave stay at the Park Hyatt riott or Four Seasons  Ive stayed at them all and The Drake doesnt even come close to comparison  Oh and dont even get me started on the restaurant  Lets just say its a step above McDs but will make you take out a bank loan  
P => Lovely hotel lots of character Stayed here  nights while in town for a convention  This is a lovely old school hotel with large guest rooms and plenty of history see the press kit on the hotel website for a list of past guests  The or is quite old fashioned as youd expect from a place like this but that gives it character   if you want shiny minimalist and modern then book at one of the many chain hotels in town instead  Room was very clean and quiet had a nice bathroom love the Crabtree amp Evelyn toiletries and the bed was extremely comfortable my only complaint would be the lighting but dim lighting is fairly standard for hotels  Internet access is quite expensive but theres a cheaper weekly rate if youre staying more than a few days  Yes the minibar is expensive but thats to be expected in a high end hotel   theres a  hour Walgreens a couple of blocks south on Michigan Ave where you can pick up snacks and drinks quite cheaply so i didnt find this a problem  The location is excellent   near the lake just off Michigan Ave a block north of the Hancock building so great for shopping dining and sightseeing  The buffet breakfast at the hotel was really good with an excellent selection of healthy and not so healthy items  I found all the staff I talked to to be friendly and very helpful  I would definitely stay here again next time Im in Chicago  
P => Amazing I was visiting Chicago for the first time and had heard so much about the Drake hotel  I told my boyfriend that I had wanted to stay there so he surprised me and booked us a room there  I must say the service was excellent  The check in went very quickly and smoothly  The staff was very helpful and considerate  The room was large well lit the linens were beautiful  We ordered some room service and it was a bit pricey but very tasty  I do recommend people to stay at the Drake and enjoy the wonderful hospitality they have to offer  I would definitely go back 
P => Wondreful grand dame hotel Recently stayed at the Drake in Chicago while attending a conference  the staff from top to bottom was polite cheerful and attentive to our needs  The room was well appointed and maintained quiet and comfortable  The in house restaurants are pricey but comparable to others in the area  The combination of a delightful staff with this grand dame hotel made for a great stay 
P => excellent all round loved this place This is a lovely hotelI was here on business and will go again some time in the future  I was a single female alone and nothing was too much trouble staff were attentive and rooms were lovely and clean well located 
P => Classic Drake Experience We had a wonderful stay at the Drake Hotel  The facility is in impeccable condition and the service is top notch  We both agreed that the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in As a suggestion park in the Drake Tower Garage to the East of the main entrance for night  
P => Excellent hotel The Drake Hotel did not disappoint We felt like home from check in through check out  The staff is extremely pleasant friendly and helpful  We got a ior Suite with a Lake view  The room was huge well appointed and well maintained  The bathroom was really nice as well  The room was cleaned twice a day but we were never disturbed  The breakfast choices were great  And I do recommend having lunch at Coq dOr   tasty tasty tasty food  Location is great as well  We really loved it at the Drake 
P => Exceptional location wonderful service My mother and I booked a  night stay at The Drake  What can I say First off the hotel is right off of Lake Shore Drive conveniently off of I  Michigan Ave  is just blocks away close to a wide variety of shopping and restaurants We ate at Mike Ditkas place only   blocks away  Wonderful food The check in process was speedy and efficient all of our requests were accomidated  The consierge desk is open until pm which is helpful  The only thing is self parking is  per day and the valet parking is  per day  TAKE MY ADVICE AND JUST SHELL OUT THE EXTRA  The parking garage was full before we checked in and we wasted an hour driving around downtown looking for parking  We finally just went back to the hotel and all of our luggage was brought to our room and quite quickly might I add  The few requests that we did have additional towels wine glasses were also addressed promptly  But the best part is the bathroom  SOOO spacious Two women with their belongings strug out everywhere and still lots of space to move around  Bottom line clean rooms attentive staff close to Michigan Ave  Shedd Aquarium Contemporary Art Museum of Chicago and much much more  LOVED THE DRAKE 
P => Historical Chicago at its best This is one historical hotel and a great place to stay if you want to be in the Miracle Mile  The Drake is a Chicago landk  Our room was a handicap access room and nicely appointed our room was on floor  and had two bathrooms with a large living area  This is an older property so keep that in mind  If you want modern this is not the place  Everything was grand and the rooms have updated furnishings  But  for a nice glass of wine was hard to swallow  Not asking for a list was my mistake  But its disappointing and the bartender made me feel less than just another person in line for services  And   for Internet is another Hilton gouge  Dont forget to price these items in when you consider the Drake  Otherwise it was a comfortable stay at a nice albeit quothistoricalquot read quotoldquot four star hotel  I would gladly stay there again for the historical significance but avoid the bar and rally for fair Internet prices  
P => STAY AWAY FROM SMOKING FLOORS I attended a conference at The Drake and reserved my room several months prior  The hotel is beautiful but I requested a non smoking room and guaranteed my late arrival  When I got there at midnight  travel delays I was told there were only smoking rooms available  nothing else  I was assured I would be moved first thing in the morning  I stayed in that stinky room because it was so late and I had nowhere I could go  I woke up several times to the smell of stale smoke  All my clothes smelled and my hair smelled and I had to attend a conference I wasnt relocated until about my th visit to the front desk at  the next day  The second room was beautiful and I have absolutely no complaints  However I was not compensated for my having to stay in the smokey room and I had to pay for it when I left even though I stated my disappointment  Well see if I even hear from them  I will NEVER stay in a smoking room again And for the price of the Drake I shouldnt have to 
P => Hot room and non caring staff My wife and I arrived for a getaway two night adventure and all was OK  The bathrooms are NOT what they should be for what they are charging but the room was clean tidy and had some savoir faire  The room was quothotquot tho about  degrees and would not cool down in the approximate  minutes we were changing for our first night out  I called management and they said they would take care of it  When I returned at  AM after a night on the town having had a few drinks the room temperature was unchanged    hotI called and management was totally unresponsive basically giving me the blow off After cleanliness this temperature is the most important part of a good hotel room and cannot be compromised  For the money stay somewhere else    like the Sofitel 
P => Nice hotel I stayed here for business and the hotel was just nice  I rooms were a bit old but very comfortable bedsThe food is excellent and the staff is very friendly  But their interenet connects stinks  
P => Could use a little work I recently stayed at the Drake Hotel for a business meeting  The public areas of the hotel are absolutely beautiful  The architecture is just stunning and the floral displays are perfect  The sleeping rooms could use a litlle work though   there was paint peeling off the ceiling the carpet was filthy  And the housekeeping wasnt the best   cobwebs in the room and hair   that wasnt mine   in the tub when I checked in  These are things I would overlook in a cheaper hotel   but with the prices you pay at The Drake you expect it to be better  
P => Good  Century experience The location is great for a touristbusiness trip  Michigan Avenue is right there  The nearest subway station is about  blocks away but the bus runs right next to the hotel  The service is great thou the hotel is quite old which has it pluses and negatives  The rooms are spacious and we had a great lake view however the or itself is just what I would call quotgranny likequot  You can tell the hotel was the quotitquot place  years ago I just think it needs some bringing it to the  century Room service was fairly quick I was there because of a conference my partner was attending but for the same money I probably would stay somewhere less quotold flashyquot and more substance such as a place with a good gym or wireless internet in the rooms  Again nothing wrong with the hotel just personal preference  
P => Beautiful hotel full of history  The Drake is a gorgeous hotel located less than a block away from the quotMiracle Milequot so if you are looking for a historic beauty and great shopping youve found the perfect place The staff members were very knowledgeable about local dining and when the power in our room went off they restored it in less than  minutes 
P => Fantastic stay at the Drake Went to Chicago for a  night holiday and the Drake was quite simply the best hotel ive ever had the pleasure to stay in Check in staff were friendly and helpful  our room was a very reasonable rate and the room was enormous with a large walk in wardrobe flat screen tv and extremely comfortable double bed we had a free box of chocolates and bottle of mineral water delivered to us when we arrived and the housekeeping service was excellent   the room was always spotless and the free chocolates each night and weather report for the following day were nice touches we were on the th floor which was very quiet and comfortable all the staff at the hotel were friendly and ready to help out the coq dor bar on the ground floor was great   friendly bar staff and the drinks werent as pricey as we thought they would be the hotel is located at the top of the magnificent mile across the road from bloomingdales and close to the john hancock centre macys hampm borders and victorias secret  its also right by the beaches on lake michigan  there are lots of bars nearby i dont have a bad thing at all to say about this hotel it was wonderful and we didnt want to leave the only problem now is that any hotel i stay in in the future will be compared to the drake and i dont think anywhere will beat it for price luxury and service  i cant wait to go back to chicago and stay again  
P => Pricey   But Very Nice Im a regular at The Drake  Been staying there every couple months for the last two years LOVE this hotel The lakeview rooms are to die for Nice airy and roomy  Most comfortable beds in the city  Staff is ultra pleasant and helpful at all hours  Check in and check out are efficient and friendly Restaurants serve delicious food at all hours Location is perfect  Right off N  Michigan Ave  Walking distance to all shopping and restaurants A bit pricey but well worth the money  The Drake gives you a nice pampered feeling while away from home  
P => Too Big for Their Britches I stayed at the Drake for a business event  The event went smoothly and the staff was accommodating  However the room was less than I expected for the price  The reduced rate was night  k fees amp taxes which was acceptable for downtown Chicago in the off season  There where several things that seemed out of character for a hotel of such notoriety  Charging for Internet Service   I travel extensively on business and I expect free internet as much as I expect clean sheets  To charge an additional  day is insulting  No Fox News Network   I did not stay at the hotel to watch TV but I expect the most popular channels to be available when I do have the time to catch up on the news  FNC is the leading cable News Network and to not provide it is crazy  The tub did not properly drain so by the time you are done with your shower the water is up to your calves   They charged me for something from the mini bar that I did not use  They removed it from my bill without any problems but it never should have been there to begin with  Charging for a local call seems silly in this day amp age as well but I admit I never even thought about the cost when I made the call  The   to cancel dinner reservations was my fault  I should have known better  Generally speaking the hotel service is well above average  The hotel itself is a beautiful old hotel that while a little worn around the edges it basically well maintained  The one bright side was the concierge service  They made great recommendations and got us dinners reservations when we wanted  
P => A mix of history  The Drake has been around for many ades yet the hotel still exudes elegance amp sophistication  We had a beautiful room on the th floor overlooking the northern view of Lake Michigan  The room was very clean and quiet  The hotel staff was very accomodating and knowledgeable  The location of The Drake is very nice however I prefer the location of the riott on the Magnificent Mile  Overall my stay at The Drake was above average and I would recommend it to any of my friends or family  
P => Disappointed We booked a ior suite with lake view and expected what was shown on the web site    a big open large suite  What we got was a small bedroom and a small sitting room  We were on the rd floor and our lake view was red by a view of the roof of the portico and the HVAC pipes There was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom and the hair dryer died during the first use  We had a man from maintenance in the room for about an hour  Who wants that They took out the dead hair dryer leaving us with a dinky little piece of k hair dryer  There is very little counter space in the bathroom There was a leak from the toilet pipe through the wall in the bathroom onto the floor obviously of long standing  All of this was reported to management on the form they requested us to fill out  Yet not a word from them apologizing for the problems The guys at the front door were first rate  People you talked to in housekeeping were just as nice as can be  But the room itself was a disappointment and Ive already steered two people away from the hotel for a visit nest month  
P => beautiful lovely and very kind staff My husband myself my son and my grandson stayed for three nights the weekend of uary     We booked two family rooms The rooms were large and spotless the hotel itsself is so clean i could not see one speck of dust on any of the  plus chandeliers  My grandson became a friend of Carlos the doorman who remembered him every time we came back to the hotel from some great museum My grandson is special needs and the kindness they showed him will always stay with me  Thank you Drake hotel and Staff p amp j brochsteinDetroit 
P => Drake a great hotel Just stayed at the Drake on business and had a great experience  The location is fabulous and the lobby is breath taking  My room was very large with  bathrooms however dont expect to see much if you have a city view  That was fine with me as I was mostly there to sleep  I would definitely stay there again  
P => Terrific Hotel The Drake is an absolutely wonderful hotel  It combines old world elegance with all the modern day amenities  Add a terrific location and room views and this hotel is clearly one of the best in Chicago  The restaurant overlooking Lake Michigan was great the lobby bar upscale and the rooms unbelievable  The room was the largest I have stayed in on any business trip  This also includes the size of the ble bathroom  The bathroom itself had both an oversized tub and ble shower  My coworker and I were completely impressed and excited about making a return visit sometime soon  
P => Grand Dame Still Has It My husband and I stayed at the Drake for one night during a weekend visit to Chicago  Weve stayed here before in a variety of rooms and have always been pleased  The Drake has always had a certain mystique to me who grew up in the area and aspired to stay here so theres always the element of having quotarrived quotOf course quotarrivalquot means one of the grandest hotel lobbies around with lush furnishings huge flower arrangements ornate fittings and all the other accouterments that a Grand Dame hotel requires  They are all in spectacular form We didnt upgrade to an executive room or lake view as we sometimes do because we were doing little more than sleeping here this time  The room was nevertheless attractive and comfortable with all the expected amenities though the bathroom could use a touch of updating  The bed was quite comfortable and the room temperature was right on    important when the outdoor temperature was in single digits and windy The Drake is not the most modern of hotels but for a comfortable stay with all required amenities plus a touch of history and old world charm its a winner  
P => loved the Drake We stayed at the Drake twice recently   uary and ruary  after not staying there for several years  I love the Ritz Carlton and usually stay there   but it is pricey  We got an excellent bargain at the Drake    last weekend   and a good price in uary   both for a quotroom selected at check inquot  This seems to be an out of the way room with a terrible view  I did ask to move but was politely told that other rooms in the category I reserved in would be very similar  The rooms however were lovely the beds supremely comfortable the bathrooms small but very nice and we were in a great hotel in a great location  Loved tea at the Palm Court  Breakfast at Drake Brothers was fantastic   my uary bargain included free breakfast   this is the best buffet We had dinner at Drake Brothers because the weather was so cold we didnt want to go out   and it was great  I read the reviews from people who reserve through Priceline and were unhappy with their rooms   I think when you get a good bargain you cant expect to get their best room  That was a trade off that I was happy to make to stay at this lovely hotel for a rekable price  
P => Best stay in Chicago     We stayed at the Drake for our Anniversary last weekend  We were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to the Vista Suite  The view was spectacular  erate living room and bedroom  Wet bar as well We were then surprised with a bottle of wine appetizers and small cake from room service  The Executive Lounge was closed  We were given vouchers for appetizers in the Palm Court as well as the full breakfast buffet for the next moring in the Drake Bros  restaurant  We dined at Drake Bros  with excellent service and the food was wonderful  One other table was seated although it was late for dinner  We then danced in the Palm Court to some great Jazz    All in all a fantastic weekend  We have to thank the entire staff for making this wonderful  
P => Its just right What a great place Spacious comfortable room amp bed considerate service outstanding restaurants trouble free high speed internet access  Nice location with many good restaurants within walking distance  A classic glamorous hotel  
P => Best in Chicago I only stay at the best hotels and when I am in Chicago its the Drake dhter and I stayed two nights  The treated me like I deserved to be treated  I would have only fired one staff if I owned it  Best suite in the house and didnt charge me what can I say  Good service and luxury are a standard of this world class hotel as its stood the test of time will return 
P => Experience The Drake Hotel Chicago  We did a  week tour of the USA over emberuary  with  older children girl  boy  and boy  going to San Francisco  Omni Hotel  Miami South Beach  Beacon Hotel  Orlando Disneyworld Pop Century Resort Chicago  Drake Hotel  New York for Christmas  Beacon Hotel  Boston  Omni Hotel  New York again  Roosevelt Hotel  including New Year s Eve at the Renaissance Hotel overlooking Times Square and a day trip to Niagara Falls  It was sometimes very cosy   sometimes downright stressful   with the kids Anyway here are my accommodation reviews  I ll mention side trips and tours too  Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct  I chose The Drake purely on its reputation history celeb status etc  I did not expect this to be a cheap or budget stay and was not disappointed but I did try some cost saving measures which The Drake was happy to accommodate see below  Put simply I wanted to stay at the famous Drake Hotel in Chicago regardless of cost I couldnt seem to get a travel agent who could organise it so I ended up contacting the hotel itself  I tried email from their website several times early in  for a ember stay but received no response  As I really wanted to try this hotel I ended up phoning it from Brisbane and made the booking that way  The girl I spoke to was very helpful with room options but despite a promise that I would receive email confirmation none came  It  have been my quotStreinquot accent  However when I sought confirmation in ember by email I did get a favourable response promptly by email and when we arrived at the hotel for our  nights all was in order One thing to note   we couldnt pre arrange transfers from Chicago OHare airport to the city the only place in many countries and cities that I havent been able to but it was simple enough to arrange a return transfer door to door from the transport desk near luggage collection at the airport and phone in a booking for the return journey The Drake is an old and impressive building with views of Lake Michigan  Great foyer  It was all Id hoped for in that regard  It is very well located   close to shops including Macys and restaurants some great and reasonably priced Irish pubs   we ate twice at the close by Dublin Pub it was so good   and it is also close to a great pancake place   The Original Pancake House   where we had breakfast every morning  Some of our best meals were in Chicago  The Drake is also virtually next door to the enormous John Hancock Centre you can view The Drake from the top  Very convenient location We had a ior Suite with two bathrooms which would have been superb for less people  It had  comfortable queen sized beds couch and chair desk and chair TV unit with drawers closet room safe minibar ethernet and two enormous bathrooms Id say the best bathrooms on the trip  As there were  of us we also took  trundle beds my cost cutting measure at no cost that Im aware of  The staff were helpful in that regard  That meant everyone had a arate bed but it was cosy and the two extra beds which stood upright during the day took up a lot of floor space at night  We had windows but were too low down for a good view  The room was quite austere   very Hilton   but nothing to complain about Receptioncheck in was fine as was check out and the staff helpful with maps etc We did a city tour with an ex Chicago cop as a bus drivertour guide which was very entertaining  We later changed buses to go to the John Hancock Centre which was the last stop on our tour  Both drivers were happy to stop the bus and open the doors to let me take photos  Afterwards when we were supposed to be returned to our hotel remember   just around the corner from the John Hancock Centre that bus driver was kind enough to take us all the way to the Sears Tower even though he was under no obligation to do so  Just us  in the big coach   he earned his tip for that At the Sears Tower the bus driver at his own suggestion got out of the bus lay on his back on the sidewalk and took photos of us  with the Sears Tower towering above us  Very friendly folk in Chicago  One girl passing in the street offered us help to find the Dublin Pub without being asked simply because shed heard us mention it  Lake Michigan was an awesome sight in winter I recommend the free zoo at Lincoln Park Chicago was great and though expensive Im pleased that I stayed at The Drake  
P => Adored the Drake Hotel I have stayed in hotels around the globe and I can honestly say by far The Drake Hotel in Chicago is my favorite  It is vary clean and well kept  There are several restaurants and bars  The food is the finest  The staff from Ben the black doorman who is preacher to the General manager who is beautiful pampered me with everything I needed for a comfortable stay from cosmetics by Gilchrest and Solmes of London to Fresh news papers  Dont loiter in The lobby because you  be offerd a coffie and a copy of the Chicago Tribune  They dont miss a beat  They have a mall or arcade in the basement with many great stores even an art Gallary  I adored their Restaurants and I dont remenber all the names but the restaurant which is a straight walk from the lobby through palm court has the finest views of the lake in all of chicago  I have stayed at most of the hotels in chicago and no hotel has better views  The Drakes Chose the location in  as the place to build way before any of the others  They did pick the best spot in all of chicago Back then Wicker park was a farm where the Scandinavians retreated to  And as a matter of fact The Drake Hotel is in the Movie Wicker Park  Its purely a grand classic from the wooden elivators with the cushy couchs and fresh fruit at every stop to shoe shines in the lavatorys  The Hotels grand lobby is orated with fine Italian furnature and everything is always spotless and in perfect shape  The only I can compare it to is Buckingham palace  Its a classic I promise you will love it When in Chicago if you happen to be visit this grand hotel over a drink or dinner and you will learn that it is the best  I have stayed in it many times and I loved every minute of it 
P => Beautiful hotel   low class accomadations My wife and I stayed at the Drake in e  The hotel is old and beautiful and well cared for  Our only complaint was that the gift shop sells hardcore pornography magazines    right at eye level with no cover  We thought it very tacky of a quotclassyquot hotel that is supposed to be family friendly  So if you travel with your kids I wouldnt recommend staying there or if you do dont take them in the gift shop unless you want to do some serious explaining  
P => Glamour Location Location Lion  At the lake end of quotthe magnificent milequot you couldnt get a better spot for a shopping trip  Large rooms clean large bathrooms excellant staff on reception and in the bars and restaurants and a stunning entry way into the hotel as it was orated beautifully for ChristmasThis is not a cheap hotel but worth the money Ill be back 
P => The Drake is Lucky For an expensive hotel the Drake is pretty cheap and cuts lots of corners  It is properly only a four star hotel in spite of its tradition  Its policy of charging for an unused final night of your reservation is understandable since there will be many things that make you want to leave early But on my first stay a large ensemble of child violin students at a convention serenaded the lobby and the memory of that brought me back This time as my wife and I were approaching dark and cold Chicago expecting a storm on the hours late California Zephyr I got a Drake concierge named Andrea on my cell phone  She arranged for a car to meet us  What she did extra was to inspire confidence in her and the arrangements she would make and to convey friendly reassurance to us in the snowy Colorado desert  quotSee you tomorrowquot she signed off The Drake has been lucky  Im not sure I would play the odds again  
P => think twice Got a great rate on Hotwire   The hotel is an old city landk at the far end of the mag mile  The lobby is ornate with fabulous holiday orations  The bar is old school with live music and dancing  We requested a room with  beds because we were traveling with children  The room was small   the beds were larger than a twin but smaller than a full  When we asked for a larger room we were told that all the  bed rooms were the same  There were no roll away beds available  The room was very hot with windows that did not open  We shut the heat off but it continued to cycle on and off all night long  The shower head in the tub was fixed at an angle toward the wall making it impossible for a tall person to shower  I would definitely never stay here again if I needed a room with more than one bed and a comfortable temperature  Complaints to the management were initally met with arogance Eventually we found someone willing to compensate us for a horrible nights sleep with a gift certificate to one of the hotels restaurants  
P => It is what it is We booked on Priceline for  per night an absolute bargain for Michigan Avenue on the weekend of the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival  While The Drake is old and I prefer newer hotels the price couldnt be beat  The room was acceptable the hotel location is fabulous and the staff was great  We were even able to extend our checkout time by one hour without any issues  All in all I would highly recommend The Drake if youre on a budget and want to stay on Michigan Ave  If you prefer newer hotels you should consider something else  For  a night booked on priceline I would definitely stay here again This place has charm and character you wont find in other cookie cutter hotels  
P => Old style Chicago Great hotel paid night which is at the top end of the spectrum  The room was large clean and well orated and perhaps most importantly it is in a very good location  I stayed for  nights and found the checkin staff very helpful   checked me in at pm with no wait   straight to my room  The lobby is fantastic and this is reflected throughout the rest of the hotel  The one area the I would say they could imprve on is the style of the rooms which are good but look dated in the schemes that have been chosen  
P => The urban myth is true The Drake is everything the urban myth says it is   I absolutely loved it The hotel is old school luxury   sumptuous velvet amazing service and a small ornate bench in the elevator in case you get tired during the ride Other reviews that I read had a few negative comments   personally I could not fault the Drake in any way  My room was spotless and very comfortable with easy chairs and ample room  The location the breakfast the Palm Court Lounge   all just fabulous and I was sorry to hand over my room card  Special mention must go to John Dowd the head concierge who was my guide to Chicago  His service extended across the Atlantic Ocean and was super efficient in making sure that I had the best time in Chicago I am now a loyal fan of the Drake and recommend it to everyone  Staying at the Drake is the perfect treat in the perfect city  
P => Best Hotel Room EVER My room at the Drake Hotel in downtown Chicago was absolutely the best hotel room Ive ever stayed in  It was huge    it had lots of windows and was very regal  The staff was great the hotel was beautiful  And for the price given downtown Chicago prices it was actually a great value  Highly recommended to anyone    its also a Hilton network hotel which is why I chose it  
P => Pay Full Price or Dont Stay At All Booked thru Priceline for night yes I know cheap  Upon check in my only option for me and my buddy was a King smoking room  I went round and round with the front desk clerk  He went to talk with his supervisor and came back and said that was my only option for the first night then they would move us the next day  He said and I quote quotThats what you get for booking though Priceline quot I was just so tired and had gotten so much attitude from the guy that I gave in  Went up to the room and it smelled TERRIBLE  Quite possibly the WORST room I have ever stayed in  Of course it smelled like an ash tray but they also used this spray to diminish the smke smell and that was even worse    think about what a port o let smells like  Plus the cooling system didnt work so it was way too warm despite the fact the window was open all night  The room they moved us to the next day was only slightly better even though the inside of the lamp shades had brown stains how does THAT happen  Overall the hotel is worn with frayed carpets and wallpaper thats coming off the walls  Both my rooms had stained celings in the bathrooms Upon check out my bill was wrong because they incorrectly charged me for mini bar items I did not consume cmon who really pays  for a bottle of Evian  And parking is night but Im ok with that because thats anywhere By the way half of our group also used Priceline to book their room at the Intercontinental also on Michigan Ave for night and got a fantastic room without the hassle and attitude All in all it seems as if the Drake is wonderful if you pay full price  For the rest of us who are travelling for pleasure and who find it difficult to pay more than night dont have high expectations for this hotel  To me it seems as if once they learn you booked through Priceline youre a nd class quotguest quot 
P => Nice Old Hotel Just back from a stay at the Drake  While it is an old hotel I was completely satisfied with the room the service and ammenities  Bed was excellent as were the linens and internet service was good which is important to me  Downtown location is great I always book through Hilton com and had a very nice room  I dont know what happens if you use other websites but I can understand why they would not get a high priority with the hotel  There is a great benefit to hotel loyalty  I highly recommend the Drake but if you are looking for quotbargainsquot its probably not the place for you  
P => Wonderful Repeat Trip This is our go to hotel whenever we are in Chicago  Try to get a corner suite overlooking Michigan Avenue  Great views and service turn down every night with cookies and milk for the kids super soft robes and wonderful location I could go on and on about this great hotel   I would leave every morning before six a m  for a jog along the lake  The doormenvalet were so supportive singing the Rocky theme and even timing meWe stayed with six people two adults and four kids  Great time all around  
P => Old World Charm Stayed there for my birthday weekend and was taken back in time to Old Chicago Great High Tea service and unbeatable lake views from rooms on that side of the hotel  Although its showing its age a bit theres still so much history amp charm around every corner  A wonderful departure from the normal tourist hotels  While youre there head up to the th floor of the Hancock Tower for a cocktail and one of the best views youll ever see  
P => Exactly as it says on the tin Stayed at The Drake for five nights in ober  It was recommended to us as an quotold classic Chicago hotelquot and thats exactly what it was  We booked a king lake view room and got an excellent large corner room with a lovely view  The hotel is full of its old character nice bar good food and staff and overall we had a very enjoyable stay  Its in a great downtown location right next to the John Hancock on Michigan Ave  Dont book here if youre looking for something modern or trendy  Its an old world hotel and it met all our expectations  
P => Historical  Yes  Needs Update Yes the Drake is a very historical hotel in Chicago and that is why I wanted to stay there  However historical you have to remember also means quotoldquot and that is exactly what the Executive Suite on the th floor that I stayed in for a week was  The carpet was so old that what used to be an embossed design was evenly smoothe to the floor and discolored  The bathroom although it had a granite countertop still looked really worn by the wood trim and cracking around frames  The so called DSL you had to pay   a day did not work and I had to keep going down to the lobby in order to use the wireless connection  If you are going to put  beds in a room at least make sure that they are full size and not just an oversized twin   the towels felt like sandpaper   The staff was very accomadating and friendly  
P => Love theDrake I took vacation during y  for a few days in Chicago  I ided to stay at the Drake for its view of the Lake  Also I dont want to look out the window and find myself staring into the rooms in other buildings  I stayed in one of the lake view rooms at the executive floor and it was exactly what I wanted  It had a fantastic full view of the lake and the Lake Shore Drive see photos  The room was large clean meticulously orated and you can tell the hotel paid attention to every detail in the room  My luggage arrived promptly  Then a hotel staff brought water and a box of chocolate free in case you wonder  I ll definitely return next time I return to Chicago  The only drawback was that the parking at the hotel costed day but you can park elsewhere and take the CTA train or walk  
P => Lovely Hotel   great location My husband and I spent last weekend at the Drake Friday amp Saturday night  We were in Chicago for the weekend with friends  Very pretty hotel fantastic location  Close to great shopping Nice views of the lake from our room  We had high tea on Friday and it was really wonderful  Conceirge was fantastic  The only complaint I would have is that the its impossible to close the door to your room without making a loud bang  So if you like to sleep late just be aware that other people leaving their rooms earlier in the day will probably wake you up when they close their doors  I would stay at this hotel again    it has a great old time elegance 
P => Nice just not my style  We visited Chicago courtesy of our in laws who surprised us by springing for a suite  The room was HUGE  Like too huge  It would have been nice were there not so much wasted space  Our suite was on a corner which  have made some of the difference and it was quite oddly shapen  There was a large sitting area and large closet and wet bar  Additionally there were two pulldown beds that sprung from the wall  It was a bit odd and it wasted a lot of space as we did not need the extra beds  The bathroom though well appointed was quite small and that extra space would have helped there  The bed and furnishings were nice and well taken care of  Super comfy bedding with a nice duvet  Unfortunately the armoire that contained the tv was in a location such that you could not see the tv from the bed which is rather inconvenient  Our room had a view directly into the Louis Vuitton store and you cannot beat the location  Immediately adjacent to the hotel is a large mall containing a Bloomingdale s and several other high end boutique shops  The staff was incredibly friendly and professional  The hotel is older but it is maintained well  The Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries are nice One thing I did find rather annoying  you have to pay  to use the gym facilities  That is absolutely ridiculous  The gym is nice and new but that should be included in the price of stay  We had brunch at the Sofitel Water Tower which was wonderful  That hotel is a bit more modern and I think if we return to Chicago we will be staying there but there is nothing wrong with the Drake  Just not my taste  
P => Chicago great    Drake old and in need of a facelift With so many awesome hotels in Chicago I cant think of any reason to stay at the Drake  Our room was old the furniture was beat up the shower didnt work properly amp the carpet had seen better days  On our way home the cabbie told us that most people he picks up at the Drake say the same thing  We had a great time in Chicago  Next time we will do more research and make sure we book a nicernewercleaner place  
P => Shes still a grand old dame We got the Drake for  for  to  from Priceline At such a low rate we thought theyd put us in a closet  They did not  No mention of Priceline at check in  We did have to wait a bit for a NS King to be available so we went down to the Coq DOr for some cocktails Our room was L shaped with the bed in an alcove and a couch two chairs desk and chair small table and a mini bar in the other part of the L  The TV was positioned on a bureau such that you could turn it to view from either the bed or the sitting area  We had a great view of the beach and lake  The concierge desk is quite useful  We had a lovely site seeing day thanks to the advice of John who has a lovely British accent The entire staff was top notch  We were very well treated  
P => Love the Drake Stayed at The Drake with  other couple for  nights and all of us could not have had a more enjoyable experience  The beauty and charm of the hotel is evident as soon as you walk into the lobby  Unlike many older hotels in the city all the rooms we were given were very large even though we booked through Priceline  The service we received from everyone on the hotel staff was efficient and first class in every way  Of course the location could not be better with it being within a short walk to Water Tower Place Oak St  beach Rush Street and all the stores and eateries along the Magnificent Mile  The Drake certainly deserves its  star rating and all of us would love to stay there again  
P => Fabulous and chic hotel Had to go to Chicago and stayed at the Drake  The hotel itself was really beautiful and what you would imagine a grand hotel would be like  Our room faced the water which was very nice  Good size and clean  Obviously the location cannot be beat youre close to everything Concierge friendly and made us dinner reservations  Its not super deluxe but there is a distinct charm that cannot be replicated in some of the newer more modern or fancier hotels in Chicago  Loved that Chanel was located in the hotel 
P => Outstanding My wife and I and another couple traveled from California to Chicago to tour the city and visit with some local friends  We booked the Drake and each couple had an executive suite with a ent view of the Lake If you want a super modern hotel this isnt it  If you like old world charm with dark wood class and lots of history this is the place We enjoyed the lobby bar area as it functioned as a living room when we met our local friends  Nice to have a drink in a nice setting with a harpist  Very relaxing and you could have a conversation We ate dinner at Drake Brothers Steak House  It wasnt very busy but the food was excellent  We are from wine country and were amazed that you could get a very nice Pinot Noir for  a bottle Lunch and cocktails at Coq de Or were also fantastic The staff was excellent with a few exceptions as there always are  Clara in the Executive Lounge on the top floor was wonderful  We felt like were in her home   lots of stories of past guests like Prince Charles Sophia Loren etc  She is a  year employee    that should tell you something The doorman Carlos was the best  To say he is very attentive is an understatement  When I inquired about the impending taxi strike on the day we were to leave he said if it wasnt resolved he would take us to the airport as it was his day off  He actually called our room the night prior to departure to schedule to pick us up  The cab strike was on and we were able to get a shuttle  But how many employees would offer to pick you up  Carlos has been at the Drake over  years Pretty close to everything we wanted to see and do but we like to walk as well  Magnificent Mile John Hancock Tower bike rentals on the lake Rush Street clubs   all within a few blocks We met several other travelers and many make an annual trip to the Drake  We will probably join the list  
P => Old School Charm nice hotel Nice hotel  I got a deal through priceline so for the cost of my hotel stay it was definitely worth it  Very s s feel to the hotel  The  elevators in the hotel was a nice feature  We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to either go up or down  The room was very spacious  It had multiple closets and a arate closet for the minibar  The bathroom though couldve been a little bigger  The small CRT tv definitely needs to be updated  The bed was nice and firm  No problems sleeping at all  The AC in the room worked well  Overall no real problems with the room  The conceirges at the hotel were definitely the most friendly people Ive ever had to deal with in a hotel  Knowledgeable and funny  They knew their stuff and offered many tips that helped us out  The hotel is close to the Mag Mile and the Navy Pier which is great for anyone coming to visit Chicago  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Exceeded my expectations  I stayed at the Drake y th for  nights  I booked on Priceline and was very surprised to have gotten the Drake  I read quite a few negative reviews on this site and was very worried I would get a dumpy room because of booking through Priceline  I called the hotel a couple weeks before arrival and asked for  beds  I was told hotel was sold out for the nights I was staying but theyd do the best they could etc  I wrote an email to reservations indicating my Silver Hilton HHonors status and again requested double beds with upgrade request  Response came promptly indicating sold out nights again but to inquire at check in for upgrade Upon arrival valet took car with a smile  Check in was smooth  I asked for upgrade  Again told hotel was sold out and rooms had been assigned by superviser according to requests  I asked how big the rooms were  sq ft   Clerk did not know but said room was comfortable  Was given room   Walked down long wide hallways with great anticipation  Opened the door and was very pleased  Room was nice size  View was very good  Faced Michigan Avenue  Extremely clean  Luxurious bed linens  My standard room came with  bathrobes  Large tv channel selection  Crabtree amp Evelyn toiletries  Awesome deal considering I got this for a steal on Priceline  Turn down service was prompt  Received excellent service throughout whole stay  Only qualm was valet was per day but it is downtown Chicago and because I was traveling with a toddler for sake of convenience I didnt look into nearby parking garage options   rate includes inout priviliges  Took car out several times  Valet guys were quick in getting the car I would definitely stay here again and would pay out of pocket direct to hotel if I got a good rate  Location is awesome 
P => Heart of Chicago Elegant A nd so close to many graet restaurants  
P => Very nice   but needs some work on service Im just back from  nights at the Drake  The hotel is beautiful and pretty well maintained  It is very large and I wondered if all the elevators were working since you had to wait a very long time for them to arrive  My friend and I had a twin double and the room was a good size although the bathroom was very small as part of a bounceback weekend package  The package also included breakfast  The area is great  Lots of activity and shops restaurants etc  Areas for improvement were all around service  Check in took very long since there were only  people at the front desk at  pm and one ofthem attracted a lot of attention with her demands  We didnt receivethe right number of breakfast coupons and the restaurant was not flexible about this and so had to go back and wait in line again The breakfast buffet was very nice especially since it was includedbut dont think Id eat there if I had to pay the full  fee  Once you sat down and they collected your coupon you never saw your waiter again so had to really work to get a coffee refill     
P => One of the best This hotel is great I went to Chicago for spring break in ch in  and stayed at the Drake hotel  The hotel is nice and big so if you want to explore then you better get your walking shoes  The room was nice and the lobby was too My room was facing Lake Michigan and had cable TV  There was a fridgeand king sized beda closetand a bathroom which include batrobes to wear  There was even a bed that you could put into the wall if you need more space  Next time I go to Chicago Im staying at the DrakeOh yeah and you can buy the bathrobes for   
P => A Pampering Oasis in a Frantic City I was visiting Chicago for the Neocon exhibition and my wife and I came a few days early to enjoy the weekend and some very cheap for Brits shopping  We had some concerns about mixed reviews but this was my th visit to Chicago and I thought it was about time I experienced the famous Drake We were allocated a nd floor room right on the corner over Michigan Avenue  This would have been ideal except we are English quotcountry peoplequot who like to sleep with the windows open Chicago drivers and cab drivers in particular use their horns extensively at any time of the day and night  In addition the fire service use their sirens constantly and those jarring bull horns at every ction  There were  fires that night With the windows closed this wouldnt have been an issue Next morning we requested a room change to the back of the hotel and without fuss all our luggage was moved whilst we were out shopping and we were upgraded to an excellent room with two bathrooms two queen beds two TVs and a partial view across the lake  Thereafter we slept with all  windows open and had no further problems  Both the rooms we used were in excellent orative order We had afternoon tea a couple of times in the Palm Court a full evening meal in Drake Bros with a table overlooking the lake and a quick meal one evening in the Coq dOr  In all cases the food was excellent with prompt and courteous service  The portion sizes in Drake Bros  were a little overwhelming but this is something we have encountered many times in the U S  over the years   we just always feel bad about so much good food going to waste The Drake is an ideal location for quotMagnificent Milequot shopping  
P => Very pleasant stay despite endless hiccups I recently attended a conference in Chicago and stayed at The Drake Hotel for  nights  The hotel lost my booking found it and then lost it again on my arrival  I had pre paid the full amount and confirmed this before arrival but unfortunately the hotel managed to lose the documentation then found it and then managed to transfer the full amount on to someone elses credit card  I was also given the wrong level of room from the one I had booked  Despite all this I really enjoyed my stay  I hired a bike and cycled every day to the conference centre along dedicated paths beside the sea through parks  Wonderful  Staff happily stored my bike every day  Breakfast was a treat though the staff  have been more helpful if they had stopped me after my th course  Very pleasant staff lovely bar area which had a great camp feel  restaurants both I thought were rather poor  So despite the hotel appearing to try their best to ruin my stay I really enjoyed it 
P => Just Great What a wonderful hotel I spent  days at the Drake in   and have rarely experienced a better hotel  My room and its amenities were great staff were welcoming and helpful and I found all aspects of my stay to have been a delight  The Drake will certainly be my hotel of choice when Im next in Chicago  
P => Historic Hotel in need of a reation I stayed here during a yearly business trip in ch  This was my first stay at The Drake  While the lobby and the hallways are very clean and shiny my room was not  The carpeting was a dingy green that was matted and stained from years of use  I would not walk on the carpet without at least wearing shoes  The lighting in the room was dim and not helped by the fire escape located right outside my window on the fifth floor  That did not really matter though because the windows do not open anyway and they had the kind of glass that is frosted with chicken wire embedded in it on the bottom half  It was best just to keep the curtains closed  Oddly my room door was approached by turning into a very narrow hallway off of the main hallway  The hallway was about ft long and only wide enough for one person to fit at a time to enter the room  I did not have neighbors so I cannot comment on the noise  Rather my room felt very isolated and I did not feel completely safe in it being down the little hallway and with the fire escape door right next to it  I would not choose to stay here again  I gave it two stars because the hotel outside of my room was quite lovely and they clearly spent time and money on it  Its just a shame I could not say the same about my room  
P => Disappointing experience due to The Drakes infrastructure problems This review is based on a stay from  to   The hotel has some nice features but my spouse and I reluctantly give the Drake two thumbs down  The Drake has two major infrastructure problems so avoid this hotel   The party walls between rooms are crackerbox thin  There is no sound insulation  At the Drake we heard our neighbors cough sneeze belch pass gas and rustle plastic bags  We heard their conversations and their TV sounds even when the neighbors were reasonably quiet and considerate  This problem goes both ways This is not a romantic hotel since your neighbors will hear all of your lovemaking sounds   If you are in Chicago when room heating is required including early il bring a portable space heater or stay elsewhere  The Drakes ancient ductwork blows cool air directly onto the bed  be the ventilation feels OK in the summer In sumy The Drake has good employees and a handsome cosmetic veneer  But the positive aspects are overwhelmed by the flawed infrastructure  A plea to the owner Hilton Hotels Please devote the neccessary tens of millions of dollars to a major infrastructure makeover  
P => Fantastic tourist or business location Great for a weekend getaway  Management upgraded us to a ior suite overlooking Michigan Ave  for  a night  We had a low corporate rate to begin with so the value was excellent  Front desk and bell service made us feel welcome  The suite was really one very large room with two pull down murphy beds which would have been good for small children  There was an enormous wedding whose masses detracted from the ambiance and overall experience of the common areas  Our room was surrounded by wedding guests and late night smoking infiltrated our non smoking floor bathroom  I bet the conferencewedding scale is not an unusual experience  We checked out much more expensive Penninsula and their service and client base were more sophisticated  Overall the Drake is a great old school hotel  
P => Maginificent Mile Rave A surprise th birthday gift of an overnight stay at the Drake was the beginning of a lovely lovely weekend  I have lived in Chicago all of my life and have never stayed at this wonderful hotel  Location of the Drake is outstanding the lobby is elegant the Coq dOr Lounge had lovely musical entertainment my room had a wonderfully comfortable bed and linens the hallways and room were quiet  The occasional honking of an outside car was part of the urban ambience for me  Others might not appreciate that  In that case request a room with a Lake Michigan view It is a pricey hotel but special pricing is sometimes offered I would stay there again in a heartbeat 
P => Attentive and caring The Drake Hotel is in a class of its own  Last month I had a reunion with four dear friends at the Drake  One of them misplaced her coat somewhere in the hotel  We asked for help in tracking it down  The concierge and housekeeping staff went above and beyond  While we were at dinner a few blocks away Cynthia from the housekeeping department delivered the coat to the restaurant  This was truly a considerate thing to do and something you dont expect unless youre staying at the Drake By the way the rooms are beautuful and everyone on staff is helpful  
P => A Grand Hotel I stayed at the Drake with my husband for a get away in ember  This was our second visit the Drake and we were not disappointed  When we checked in they said welcome back  Let me say up front we a Hilton Gold members and each time we were upgarded to a large room might be a ior suite on the executive floor which might color my review  The room was lovely and elegant    crown molding rich fabrics a sofa and chairs bathrobe and slippers and about every amenity you can think of in the bathroom  The heating was a tad bit noisy  The bed oh the bed  I usually look forward to my own bed after a hotel stay but the Drake beds are truly heavenly at least for me  I slept so well Overall the room and lighting were just sooo comfortable just visiting for a second time felt like home  The staff were all gracious and in the morning at the executive lounge the hotel manager came by to see how we enjoyed our stay  When we were checking out as our parking was being validated he came by again to make sure we werent delayed  Great Service  The executive lounge has an absoutely wonderful view of Oak St  beach and Lake Michigan  Its a great place to unwind for appetizers and drinks  After dinner we we there again for a nightcap  Lovely furniture and muted lighting  The food was of high quality salmon good cheeses fruit amp veggies and the service was great  The only drawback if you need a pool there is none  We will be back for another get away  
P => Nice Hotel We booked  rooms for  nights ch   Each room was a very comfotable size with ent size bathrooms  The hotel is old and not modernized as the big name and boutique hotels you usually find in big cities With that in mindIf you go to the hotel with realistic expectations you will be pleasantly surprised The views each room had were outstanding That is when we could seevery foggy week  On the down side of the rooms were the fact that you could not control the temperature I could never get comfortable The temperature was set on  the entire time and It was more like  We had the window open  inches as far as it would open and never cooled the room One of our friends finally ordered a fan for each room and that helped with sleep a little The rooms were clean and housekeeping did a nice job and the rooms were cleaned early I had one complaint to my friends that my glass globes in the bathrooms had one inch thick dust on each of them When they looked at the ones in their rooms it was the same Easy to cleanas they could have been lifted right off and wiped down That hadnt been done in years  Oh well The concierge is useless Go to another hotel for the use of their conciergeit would be quicker and more helpful He was on the phone the entire time and never looked up We finally left the line to go find our destination on our own  Terrible attitude on another stop by another time in the lobby I also would mention the horrible service in the Coq dor Restaurant We ordered drinks and  minutes of trying to stop the waiter for our orderswe finally paid and left Pretty bad that we left the property to go to another property to spend money because we couldnt get someone to wait on us Regardlesswe had a good timewe probably would stay here again If only for the weekend  
P => A Very Special Place This hotel is wonderful  Yes some of the other reviews talk about the size of the rooms but this hotel offers many things you cant find anymore  The lobby is amazing the staff is wonderful the service is great but more than anything else this hotel oozes elegance There are many four and five star hotels to choose from in Chicago but this is the only one that makes you feel like youve stepped into another time and place  It is a real treat  The front desk has umbrellas the bar and lounge area is wonderful its recommendations for dinner were outstanding Dont miss this one  
P => Not much tops this ol Grand Dame hotel    Let me say that I am very high maintenance about hotel rooms   I pick them apart from top to bottom so trust me I scour TripAdvisor reviews when choosing a hotel  My boyfriend thinks I am nuts but that is another story   haha In all my experiences at the Drake this doesnt happen   I have to search for flaws and if found they are minute The Drake is a wonderful hotel that is comfortable very clean has the old world elegant feel to it  I tend to stay in mainly at   hotels Westins Sheratons etc  and I will pay a premium for location comfort amp amenitiesluxury I stayed here once on business for  weeks in  and thoroughly enjoyed the service level of comfort amp location  I love these old Grand Dame hotels   hotels like the Plaza in NYC amp the Royal York in Toronto and such  Ones that were built in the early s and that are chock full of beautiful architectural details and have hosted Kings and Queens  The Drake is no exception I ided to take a quick trip to Chicago this weekend and despite the fact I knew Id get a much newer room with a glitzier lobby amp perhaps more trend at the Ritz or Four Seasons or Park Hyatt but I opted for the relaxed old school hotel with good service with a smile from the staff at the Drake  There is nothing to compare it to in Chicago  Take a look at my picturesA few highlights  we got a great deal on a Deluxe King room    per night versus  for the   hotels in town  great location on the quotMiracle shopping Milequot on Michigan overlooking Lake Shore Drive and the lake  Our room had a view onto the lake one block away from the John Hancock Tower  super comfortable Hilton beds this is a Hilton hotel after all elegant yet comfortable room furnishings the bathroom was OK but large and slightly uninspired BUT the towels were I think the softest I have used in any hotel in the past few years the bath towels amp bathrobes were sooo soft amp comfortable which was a nice surprise the concierge couldnt be nicer amp went out of her way to help us with finding a local hair salon for my partner amp getting me an umbrella so I could make a after dinner run to the Cheesecake Factory a guilty pleasure of mine for some dessert  free breakfast with the Hilton Honors program was included in our reservation   though the buffet was   out of  though the French Toast was delicious it did include all the basics including a chef preparing fresh omelettes If youre going to stay at the   in Chicago the Four Seasons or Ritz go ahead because the Drake wont surpass them in terms of luxury or swankiness  Can some of the in room furnishings be updated yes can the bathroom have heated towel racks yes  But if you want a beautiful historical   hotel with beautiful public spaces excellent restaurants solid service with a smile very very affordable luxury very comfortable and elegant rooms and an unbeatable location stay at the Drake  
P => Very good but not up to par with other  star hotels in the area Comparing this hotel to other  star hotels in Chicago as well as the  star Palmer House I found the Drake to be very good overall but lacking in a few areas On the positive side the lobby is beautifully and tastfully orated and the hotel is in good repair despite its age  The front desk was well staffed and the hospitality level was fairly high  And the rooms were well sized and nicely furnished On the negative side the air conditioning or thermostat did not work which was not that big of a deal in the winter but the room get too hot for my preference  Also there were some ugly stains on the curtains and wall paper  But most disappointingly when I was checking out and needed some shipping tape to seal a box the first concierge and desk clerks that I spoke to told me they didnt have anyway  Later I spoke to a second concierge and she found me some but I was a little unhappy that several staff members turned me away so easily  Other four star hotels would have made more of an effort in little matters like this So overall the Drake is a fine hotel  If you want an immaculate room and top notch service youd do better at some other places such as the Sofitel but you cant go that wrong at the Drake  
P => Staying at the Drake is a Treat The Drake is a beautiful hotel with old world style and charm at the same time encompassing modern ammenities  It is especially beautiful to stay here during the Christmas season   the lobby looks exquisite with the ornamental Christmas tree and the sound of the beautiful harp music coming from the Palm Court where they serve excellent and delicious afternoon teas  Checkin is usually at PM but we were graciously checked into a room at AM having arrived from a long flight  Stayed in a Deluxe King room facing Michigan Avenue   very spacious comfortable and charming One of the best advantages of staying at the Drake is its fantastic location   walking distance from luxury boutiques and department stores restaurants and city attractions  I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel  
P => Wonderful hotel My husband and I stayed at the Drake Hotel in Chicago   th and th  We had a wonderful stay  The hotel lobby was orated for Christmas which made it even more beautiful   We booked a Bounceback Package which included an excellent breakfast buffet  There was an extensive array of choices which included fresh fruits omlets sausages hot and cold cereal etc  Everything was great  I would highly recommend this package  Our room was large  We had a king bed and a wonderful lake view  We even had time to walk along the beach  The location is excellent  We could walk to all the stores Rush Street and even to the Navy Pierwhich is a little far  Cabs are plentiful   We used the mass transit system too The doormen and concierge were extremely helpful and friendly The people at the front desk were a bit too formal and stiff I would highly recommend staying at the DRAKE  The hotel is older  which I liked because it gave you a nostalgic feeling  Everything was CLEAN and polished  I will return again and again  The Drake is our hotel of choice when we visit Chicago  
P => Everything was wonderful I stayed at the Drake for  nights from   through   while attending a conference at the hotel directly accross the street the Millenium Knickerbocker  I had read the negative reviews about the Knickerbocker and ided to stay at the Drake  What a delightful experience The Drake is truly a classy place in the tradition of grand old hotels  The lobby was beautiful and the rooms were exceptionally comfortable and very large  Although the carpet was just a bit worn everything was clean as can be and in excellent repair  After venturing outside in frigid temperatures it was great to slip into the plush robes that were provided then later crawl into the extra comfortable warm bed I ate at the Cape Cod room in the hotel while there which was perfect  Also ate away from the Hotel at The Chicago Chop House wonderful Carmines delicious and Ginos East perfect pizza  The staff at the hotel were very helpful and pleasant  I would definately stay here again  
P => Is the Drake resting on its laurels i recently stayed at the drake for four nights i have to agree that the property   once you get past the grand lobby area   is in need of a good steamcleaning the bathroom while large felt outdated and dingy the beds and furnishings have seen better days my overall feeling was that the property needs one giant upgrade however the workout rooms were very nice airy and well appointed  
P => Couldnt have been better    After visiting the hotel for tea on a short trip to visit friends in Chicago as a college student I ided one day Id come back to stay at the hotel  I booked a room for a romantic weekend with my husband and really looked forward to it until I read several reviews on this website that left me feeling pretty nervous that our room would have threadbare carpets tired furniture etc  Nothing could have been further from the truth  Our room was absolutely lovely   a deluxe room which was quite roomy and had new carpet linens and drapes  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  The lobby was gorgeous  The best part for me was the hotels historic feel  It felt like something more than quotJoe fancy hotel quot I highly recommend enjoying afternoon tea in The Palm Court  The food is delicious the setting elegant and the harp music will soothe even the most stressed out traveler  Well be returning to The Drake the next time were in Chicago  
P => Terrible service Nice lobby and the lobby restaurant  But rooms are old sound isolation is bad rooms are erated each other by doors and you can hear the next door easily  But above all service is very very very very bad Was there on business trip but I would not spend my own one penny there 
P => Awesome stay at the Drake I was at the Drake from ember    and I have to say that it was the best hotel Ive ever stayed in  I was in Chicago for an engineering conference at another hotel  I got a great deal on airfare and hotel through hotwire  The rooms were good sized and exceptionally clean  The beds were great and the lobby was like something out of a movie  The best part about our stay was the complimentary limo service within a certain number of blocks from the hotel  Our driver PJ was awesome I cant say enough good things about the Drake  
P => Charming Visit The Drake is always wonderful  Physically it is not the most modern hotel in Chicago but the charm and level of service is excellent  We stayed in a deluxe king overlooking the lake and the beach  What a view The bed and linens were excellent  The bathroom though quotvintagequot was sparkling clean  Actually its look and fixtures are back in style again  The doorman truely remembered us and would start up our conversation where we left off previously  The concierge also was very helpful with restaurant reservations and finding the appropriate plug adapter for my cell phone charger  We go to Chicago three or four times a year and stay at different hotels based upon our activities but my dhters and I always have tea at the Drake  It is very relaxing after a long day  In my opinion the front desk at all Hilton Hotels could be better staffed and more efficient  This is also true for the Drake  However this is the only negative about our whole experience and is easy to overlook by all the other good points  An overall excellent place to stay  
P => The Drake is wonderful Just returned from a  night stay  With just one exception everything about the Drake was absolutely wonderful  Reading the TA reviews I have a very difficult time accepting some reviewers negative comments as referring to the same hotel as the one in which I stayed  The only exception to an absolutely wonderful experience was the drainage in the bathtubshower I did experience very slow drainage which meant that there were   inches of standing water in the tub by the time I completed my shower  But other than this which is somewhat understandable in an  year old hotel I found the Drake charming spotlessly clean and in a wonderful location  My room was beautiful spacious and had a lovely view of Oak Street Beach  The bed was the most comfortable that I have ever experienced  Staff were universally friendly and helpful  I will look forward to the opportunity to stay here again  
P => Wonderful Great location Wonderful rooms and Outstanding service  
P => Wonderful Stay         We stayed at the Drake the weekend of t   while in town for my cousins wedding   First off what a great location   We stepped into the hotel and were greeted my wonderful staff  We were up on the executive level and was well worth the gt   Unlimited cocktails in the afternoon along w appetizers  Our room was enourmous almost the size of  rooms we had a large sitting area couch coffee table erate dressing room and a large walk in closet  This was just the King Deluxe room not a suite   We had room service the first nite the food was good and it was fun eating off a table set in nice linens they wheeled in the room   All in all what a great stay and look forward to staying there again  
P => Definately do the Drake My dhter and I recently stayed at The Drake Hotel for a week  We not only fell in love with this grand hotel but it was just one reason to go back to Chicago again and again  The Drake is situated right on beautiful lake Michigan and is walking distance to many stores as well as the quotelquot station  We enjoyed above average service at the Drake including complimentary champagne and ice cream at The Coq DOr beautiful plushy robes and a staff with a real sense of humor after my dhter overflowed the stately but small tub  We had more fun enjoying details such as benches in the elevator and fragrant bouguets in the lobby than we ever would have with another sterile pool or cookie cutter room  We will definately go again  
P => Great Location   a Historic Hotel I just returned from a  week stay at the Drake and was pleased that the hotel has retained some of its grandeur  My husband amp I were ried there  years ago  The lobby is still beautiful exceptional flower arrangements as well as the Palm Court which serves afternoon tea and has a harpist playing there most afternoons  We were also there on Saturday night when they had a small band amp singer for those that cared to dance  Breakfast was quite expensive in the Drake Brothers but on Tuesday nights they have buy  steak get one for    A group of us went Tuesday night and had great steaks  The service at the hotel was excellent from the front desk to the doorman to the great concierges my husband used them extensively to book several dinners for large parties at the last minute  The hotel also offered complimentary limo service book in advance to area places as well as to the airports  The only downside that we saw was that the rooms could use a little freshening up  Our carpet was a little threadbare as was the furniture  The bed was wonderful and the bathrooms were clean altho there was a little problem getting a consistent temperature in the shower you could get scalded  While in Chicago we had some great meals including Coq dOr piano music at night and the Drake Brothers at the Drake  We also ate at Shaws Crab House the Saloon Hugos Frog Fultons on the River Ballo  a part of the Rosebud organization Carnivale wonderful latin food igold the best Indian food I have ever had Tuscany in little Italy Heaven on  for ca and the best meal we had was at Catch my husband actually had dinner there  nights great fish and on Sunday nights  priced wine on select bottles  I have heard that the Drake property has been sold to an investment group but that Hilton will still manage the hotel  I hope that they are able to retain its elegance and update the rooms in the process  I would stay here again  The location is wonderful and the staff is great 
P => Wonderful hotel I was attending a conference at the Drake  The hotel was very elegant  The staff were so very helpful and knowledgeable  I was traveling alone so I was a little apprehensive about seeing the sights by myself  The staff gave me wonderful advice on where to go and what to do  The room was beautiful with an old hotel feel  The meals that were provided for our conference were delicous as well  I also took advantage of room service which was quickly delivered to my room and was piping hot and very tasty  I had an awesome  days and nights at the Drake  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the quotOld Hotelquot charm that for the most part seems to be long gone and forgotten  
P => Excellent Hotel My wife and I redeemed some Hilton points for  night at the Drake and were not disappointed  Ive stayed any many Hiltons and must say that this is the most historic hotel Ive ever been at  While the room was enough for me and my wife it wasnt the largest weve been in as we usually get upgraded for being a Hilton Diamond member  However we had a lakeside view which was very impressive  The living room was spacious and the twin beds were very comfortable plus the closet was very big  Also the consierge at the Drake was extremely helpful and knowledgable about the Chicago area  This hotel is very convienent if you are going to look around the north area of Chicago  It is a stones throw away from the John Hancock building and across the street from the Chicago Harbor and Lake Shore Drive  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago  
P => Grand Old Hotel My sister and I met for a weekend in Chicago and used Hotwire for a  star hotel near the quotMagnificent Milequot  We were pleased to get the Drake and I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again  It has an old fashioned elegance  Our room was very satisfactory  We had  beds and felt like they were bigger than twin size but smaller than full  Not sure this is possible so be they were just extra long twin Very comfortable with nice bedding  We were on the east side of the hotel could see a little of Lake Michigan from one of our  windows  I think if you were on the North side you would have a better view  Crabtree and Evelyn bath products  Staff at the bell desk and concierge were very pleasant and accomodating  Excellent location for shopping and many nice restaurants nearby    expensive ones but also more neighborhood type places  The carpet looked like it was from the s or s but actually still in good shape  No complaints  We peeked into the room across the hall from us when the maid was cleaning and it looked much smaller than ours so like many older hotels I would guess there is a lot of variation in rooms so you dont know what you might get  We paid  on Hotwire more like  with taxes and felt like that was a great price  
P => Great Hotel I stayed  nights and booked  rooms for a family girls  of usweekend  The rooms were very spacious beds were extremely comfortable from the king bed full beds to the queen murphy bed and the pullout sofa  We had the quotFamily Roomsquot one with  bathrooms which  girls aged  to  shared and they loved every minute Afternoon tea was outstanding   I felt like I was in London again  The entire staff was smiling pleasant courteous and extremely helpful  We had to wait  mins for one of our rooms to be ready but they gave each of us a complimentary card  each to use in the bar  The food is outstanding especially breakfast  The entire hotel is beautiful and elegant with the largest floral displays Ive seen  The location is perfect and the view of the lake was outstanding  Weve ided to make this an annual trip and will certainly stay at the Drake next year  
P => Great place to stay Reading all of these reviews made me very nervous  I lived in Chicago for many years so the idea of staying at the Drake for our recent visit was exciting  it is a famous and historical hotel  In my opinion the reviews on Trip Advisor are very harsh  We stayed for  nights  Had a room on the th floor facing north view of Oak Street Beach  The bathroom had obviously been recently redone  ble tile and very clean  The only thing I can nit pick about is the carpet  it was a little warn  The bed was so comfortable and clean  white linensduvet cover  Everything was clean and fresh  We usually stay at hotels such as the Sofitel or W and the Drake was comparable  We paid a very competitive rate of  and for this hotel I imagine I would pay up to  a night  Very nice stay overall  no complaints 
P => So Romantic My husband and I celebrated our th Wedding Anniversarry at The Drake Hotel Chicago  At first after reading reviews here I came close to cancelling my reservation and just rebook at a different hotel  Since The Drake is a well known romantic hotel we gave it a try anyway  For a  year old hotel the Drake has preserved its elegance The hotel was lovely  My husband and I love how the lobby was set up and orated  Our room was nicely orated clean and had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan  And staff   very very nice and welcoming  The Doorman Jay was so helpful after giving us our luggage claim tickets he directed us to the Front Desk  Bell attendant avio right away asked if I needed assistance with my carry on luggage and welcomed us to the hotel  Check in was fast and smooth thank you to the wonderful receptionist Valarie who welcomed us right away with a smile and a faboulous room  Housekeeper was friendly  Room Service staff and Restaurant Staff were nice and friendly  Everything was great  Concierge was indeed knowledgeable and helpful  Express checkout was a great convenience for us as well The room was lovely more than we expected  The bed was so comfortable and the room was well cleaned  The Restaurants especially the Cape Cod Restaurant is my favorite  Breakfast Buffet at the Drake Brothers was reasonable   pax because the food was just great Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Drake Hotel  We will return to Chicago and certainly stay here again  
P => Great location wonderful stay My fiance and I just got back last night from five nights at The Drake   our first time in Chicago  As for the location we thought at first that The Drake was far away from the heart of the city but were from Boston and were not used to such a far reaching city  We based that assumption on the distance half a mile be more between The Drake and the touristy hotspot Navy Pier  We soon learned however that theres so much to do right around the hotel   the beach the upscale restaurants on North Rush the less upscale bars at Rush and Division  So while The Drake is a good walk from Navy Pier and the river area its still in a great spot  The hotel itself is elegant and classic  There are many new trendy boutique hotels in the city but it was cool to stay in such a Chicago landk  Our room was on the small side but it was still lovely and we think it was abnormally small compared to most rooms our friends were in a very standard room that was good sized  In the past weve stayed in very nice hotels   The Ritz The Fairmont the St  Francis in San Francisco   and the Drake measured right up  We had a great stay and look forward to going back 
P => Highs  In from Toronto amp spent a week combined businesspleasure w my wife  High points breakfast buffet was fresh  Service at F deskconciergebellhopcleaning staffdoor staff all acceptably good Great locationgood florist amp quality bath extras Impressive banquet foyer amp Palm Court areas Bed amp bedding comfy Cape Cod Room staff amp dining excellent  Historical feel comes through certainly  Low points tired room carpeting amp furniturepoor bath drainageamp we felt The Drake is asking top dollar for what is given you will not come away thinking quotwowwhat great valuequot  NOTE The Palmolive Bldg is in the process of becoming condos  Because Walnut is a very narrow street those condos will have a great view into rooms on the Drakes SOUTH side so at some point I think it would be advisable privacy wise to try your best to get rooms on the north or west side  P S  This was my second trip to Chicago which is my fave US city as it is now for my wifetoo amp many thanks to the Chicago people who have made both trips all the better  
P => This should be a Two Star Hotel The Drake quotusedquot to be one of Chicagos finest hotels  Well its not today  Hotel rooms are dirty and very tired  The first room I checked into had long hair in the bath tub and the carpet had stains on it  I checked into another room to find it clean yet very in need of touch up  Details like caulking in the bathroom needing a bleach pen  The tub didnt drain and I ended up showering with four inches of water  Carpets needed to be replaced  If it wasnt during the Neocon convention I would have changed hotels The entire place needs a face lift  Housekeeping staff woke me up every morning talking so loud it was almost shouting  The worst part was the lady was discussing getting her tubes tied to her friend that was down the hall    at am  In addition the walls are paper thin and I could here the couple having sex and talking next door Its a shame that such an amazing landk has gone downhill  I wouldnt recommend staying at The Drake  The only benefit of staying here is its close to everything  However there are tons of hotels in the area  
P => Drake Hotel Stayed for  nights at the Drake supposed to say  but checked out early and move to The Penisula  The only thing nice I can say about the Drake is the that view is spectacular otherwise the place is an overpriced dump  
P => The Drake Hotel did not impress me For the price we paid the Drake Hotel did not impress me  This hotel has a lot of history  There is a little display on the ground floor next to the elevator about how Queen Elizabeth Prince Phillip and Lady Diana have all stayed at the hotel  Each room has a history book in it too so that you can read about the history of the place  From that aspect it was interesting to stay at The Drake  But I have paid a lot less and gotten better service and nicer surroundings elsewhere than we had at The Drake  We had reserved a king bed and upon check in we were offered two over sized twin beds  When we were unhappy we were offered a queen bed  When we were STILL unhappy they quotfoundquot a king room for us  The rooms were spacious  The shower was incredibly difficult to figure out  The handle that we thought turned it on would not move  After pounding it and nearly breaking it off the wall we got it to turn on  We never ate at the hotel because it was overpriced   for breakfast buffet I would not bother staying there again  There are too many other hotels in the same area  
P => Unbelivable location location location The Drake hotel what can I say  Unbelivable  We travel oftentons  for pleasure and this was one of the best  Definately as nice as the Ritz  Seasons etc  but with years of history  We like top of the line hotels and this was it  The beds were so comfy  Goose down duvet  Nice large baths wgranite tops and floors  Gorgeous lobby great door people great staff  Most beautiful and huge flower arrangements that I have ever seen in the lobbies  I will never again go to Chicago without staying at the Drake  One block from the beach   mile or less from Navy Pier  Also on Michigan Ave which is the best street  Take your walking shoes  We probably walked at least  miles in  days  Rooms are nicely updated  Large closets  No balconies or jacuzzi tubs but thats the new stuff  If youre looking for the best location in town and a hotel with a quotpastquot definately the DRAKE is the place to stay  Its good enough for the Queen of England and Al Capone its good enough for me  
P => Happy New Year Love it Love it Love it Go for the unique and historical  The Drake is just  classy It takes you outside the modern world  although it is modern  Classic is timeless  and so it doesnt need to change  And I hope it never does We stayed over New Years for  nights and had a lovely room  very spacious and elegant  The bed is by far the most comfortable I have evef slept in  We wanted to take it with us  We bought the robes  those were very fine  If you can stay on the Executive level  It added so much to our experience  You can access it all the time  but breakfast is available and also pre dinner apps and cockatails  all included  The room has internet access for free and supplies the perfect atmosphere for intimate conversation and meeting people  The drinks include all cocktails soft drinks and various wines and the apps were great   veggies and dips fruits cheese and crackers salmon nuts a variety There is something about this hotel that makes you feel quotSomewhere In Timequot  just happy walking in and out  The restaurants are all awesome and have actually been there for many years  Many of the employees have also been there many years which I think adds so much to the charm and timelessness of the hotel  The seafood is great  the views of Lake Michigan  the staff very nice  When you have afternoon tea which is pricey  but worth the experience  it is so cute to see little girls with their moms and their American Girl dolls   such manners Most everything on Michigan Ave is in walking distance  very convenient and I also jogged each morning  safe and nice to jog around  even in winter I highly recommend this hotel if you appreciate by gone eras  America in her infancy and heyday  and classics   and just luxury This would be a great place for a wedding  
P => Wonderful You could feel the history in this wonderful grand old hotel  The service was top notch and classy  Include the breakfast with your room  The location was great  Shopped on the Miracle Mile  Walked to Old Town to Second City Review via the brownstones  Took the el train around the city etc  Yes it is pricey but it is an experience out of time  
P => Pleasent stay in this landk hotel I visited Chicago a dozen times since  and always admired The Drakes location and architecture  During my latest visit to the town I finally stayed at The Drake  You cannot really beat the location  I stayed in an Executive Room with Lake View    actually I would not have stayed there if no rooms with Lake View were available The hotel was clean and comfortable    I particularly liked the bed    and the size of the Executive Room is generous  As in previous reviews the hotel could definitely do with reation    it reminds me of the house of a widowed aunt who used to be rich but not any more and living on old glory  I did not really mind that The consierge proved to be very helpful my only problem was with the front desk staff upon checking in they claimed I had cancelled my reservation  This was not the case since I booked online  days before my arrival    and obviously had no reason to cancel  I insisted THEY had a problem with their systems and wanted to talk to the manager     surprisingly the matter was settled a few seconds later    I wonder why the issue in the first place  
P => Overpriced and in need of a major facelift I recently stayed at the Drake for  nights on a business trip  My experience was bad from the very start  The staff at check in was very inexperienced and unprofessional  The doormen and concierge were helpful however  The rooms really need updating  the bathroom was filthy paint chipping off scuffs on the doors dirty bathtub  Its never a good sign when I dont want to take off my shoes or sit down when I enter a hotel room The walls are very thin  we could hear snoring from the room to our right and tvtalkingphones ringing from the room to our left  to the point that we had to go buy earplugs   and I live in a city  They dont enforce quotno smokingquot floors  we constantly smelled strong smoke  The restaurant was mediocre I only ate there for breakfast and the servers were again unprofessional and not the least bit helpful  The drinks in the bar are very overpriced and one person in our party ordered a glass of white wine and it had gone bad  She asked how long they keep there bottles open and he said up to a week which is ridiculous when you are paying  a glass for a very average wine  I got the impression that this hotel makes all their money from private parties  Every time I walked through the lobby there was a wedding or function of some kind and on more than one occasion there were obnoxious drunk people in the lobby  One night there was a girl a bridesmaid presumably passed out at the bell desk and no one seemed to mind  At the end of our stay when I paid the bill  for  nights  I realized I would have been furious had I been paying this out of my own pocket  and no one asked me how my stay was  This hotel is in a good location but there are many many better options in Chicago  
P => Why I prefer the Drake I left Chicago  years ago to move to London and return regularly  I always stay at The Drake not only because it holds a part of the Chicago I left behind but because it has provided us with the location which was only down the street from our former residence  We are still members of The Club International the private dining club within the hotel and have always received wonderful personal service throughout the many years that we have used the hotel while living in Chicago and living abroad From the minute we arrive from the airport we are greeted enthusiastically by the front door staff and the bellman  We dont always get the same people at the reception desk they seem to be always changing or training new people but still as Club members and Diamond Hillton Honors card holders we have experienced a wide range of rooms that the hotel offers generally and to those with Hilton Honors cards  The best rooms face the lake and the executive rooms offer the best bedding  Yes the hotel is tired and yes the bathrooms need to be updated  But the personal service has made up for this over and over  All the staff is friendly  The food in the Executive Club Lounge is excellent and you would be hard pressed to find a better view  anywhere enjoying a light breakfast or early evening cocktails  The breakfast in the restaurant is always consistently good and the friendly restaurant staff has always greeted us personally  Where the hotel falls down is the constantly changing reception staff and many of the rooms need to be updated  But the location is fantastic the rates are excellent compared to some trendy hotels especially in the winter off season months and little Coq Dor bar and restaurant offers a great informal menu  It was always a great neighborhood bar for those who lived in the Streeterville area and it continues to be that and more to those staying in the hotel  it offers great burgers light music and good cocktails  Although there is no health club within the hotel one only has to cross the street and use the gym in the lower level of mall that houses Bloomingdales  I hope the hotel continues to keep up with the times  I will always hold it in high regard  
P => Not worth the money Ive stayed at the Drake about  times over the past  years  Here are my positives and negatives   Positives Great location day for the Equinox gym Lake Michigan View Breakfast Buffet was delicious but pricey ppNegatives Bathrooms are in terrible need of a makeover Service in the tea room is not what I expected very slow  No gym available inside the hotel its across the street Its not worth the money anymore  The Palmer House has better rooms 
P => Loved the Drake From the moment we arrived at this lovely hotel until we leftthe staff could not have been nicer or more helpful  Check in was easy and as diamond HH we were upgraded to an executive room with a beautiful lakeside view  the room was spacious very clean and the bed was so comfortable  The free water each day was appreciated Breakfast in the executive lounge was good and the free drinks in the evening were a nice surprise The hotel has a lot of old world charm and the entrance and lobby are spectacular  The position is goodespecially for the shops and there is a lovely lakeside walk We had absolutely no complaints about the Drake and look forward to another stay  
P => drilling hammering and cold water for  bucks a night Saved up my dollars and was really looking forward to some old world elegance and charm at The Drake  Im sorry to say I was sorely disappointed  Yes the lobby the bar and the elevator areas are absolutely stunning in terms of or but thats about as old world charm y as it gets  I had booked in ember for a  night stay in   per night is not to be sniffed at and having reserved a quotking room deluxequot I was expecting something relatively posh   I got a bog standard hotel room with some fancy lighting  The mattress was hard the water in the shower all mornings was luke warm at best cold at worst  Clearly the hotel gets v busy at the weekends so on my second night I had guests in rooms either side of me and in one case I could hear what these people were saying and what TV channel they were watching  Not so much fun at am when they arrive back from their night out  On my last morning before departure I neednt have bothered organizing an alarm call   drilling and hammering started directly beneath my room at am sharp  I have to say the staff at the Drake were extremely friendly and courteous but the service levels are very poor  Its really annoying when you get all excited about a hotel stay which falls far short of your expectations  Also the room service was extortionate   how on EARTH is a seafood salad a side of fries and a bottle of average red wine  
P => Traveller alert Beware new reservation policy at Drake Hotel This is a heads up for all those planning travel to Chicago  Busy professionals often need to change their travel plans  Those who like me occasionally find themselves in this situation should be aware that the Drake Hotel now charges the full rate to ones credit card months in advance of the planned visit and then refuses to refund any of the amount if a cancellation is necessary  This policy is mentioned in the fine print at the bottom of the reservation confirmation and is not announced on the phone at the time the reservation is made  Busy travellers should band together and refuse to patronize any hotel that follows such an inflexible and frankly confiscatory reservation policy  
P => Exceeded expectations We stayed at the Drake for one night on uary    Having recently moved from Chicago to Arizona and back visiting family we had one quotkid freequot night to enjoy downtown  After checking rates we found the Drake for tax on a Friday night   a great deal given the location and the fact that other hotels in the area   Four Seasons Ritz Park Hyatt Peninsula   are in the  nt range  After reading the reviews and knowing a bit of the Drakes past we expected a grande dame but showing a bit of her age Well she does but dont let it discourage you  First the hotel exudes old world charm of a bygone era   from the beautiful lobby with its enormous floral display being replaced when we arrived with an abundance of lillies reminding us of our wedding day to the classic fountain in the Palm Court to the classic furnishing in the rooms  As for the room we showed our Hilton Honors card sign up online before you stay and were rewarded with an automatic upgrade to a deluxe room with a sitting area  We asked and we were told that the room would face the Drake Tower  In other words a view of a brick wall  We instead used the quotupgradequot for a standard room with a lake view and were given a beautifully appointed traditional room looking out over Lake Shore Drive and Oak Street Beach  The night we stayed there it snowed a magnificent   inches of heavy wet snow clinging to the tree branches and light posts and the view was truly wonderful  The bed was comfortable with lots of down pillows and a comfortable duvet  The only downside   no flat sheet  As a traveler wary of hotel bedspreadscomforters having seen too many Datelines on the subject it was a little unneverving but the linens were crisp blindingly white and appeared to be new so no hesitatation  The bathroom is also a bit of the older type but good water pressure standard Gilchrest amp Soames products and perfectly cleaned not a streak on the mirrors or polished granite floor tile Another bonus of signing up for the Hilton Honors program was the free breakfast vouchers for the Drake Bros  restaurant  Skip the buffet   we ordered off the menu and it was delicious scrambled eggs with smoked salmon on an english muffin and lox and bagels with fresh tomato slices ripe red onion and abundance of fresh deliciously salty capers  We expected to be charged for the fresh squeezed OJ and coffee we ordered in addition to our meals and were pleasantly surpised when our waiter smiled and said quotno sir we appreciate you staying here it is all taken care of quotIt was a wonderful albeit too brief stay at a wonderful old school hotel that still has it all together  Yes the walls  be bit thin the neighbors were quiet although we got back into the room late   remember we only had one kid free night to enjoy ourselves and the chair rails and furniture  be dinged here and there but the location the oozing charm and the value cant be beat  Well be back 
P => Classic and elegant   stay at The Drake My wife and I stayed  nights at The Drake in uary   As Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to an Executive Room with a lake view  It was our anniversary weekend and we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and a small cake in our room  Very nice touch from the General Manager The hotel is truly beautiful   much like the Waldorf Astoria in NYC  Location is unbeatable right on Michigan Avenue and incredible lake views  It is an older hotel but I didnt see any signs of wear  For the price we paid  a night it was really hard to beat We had access to the Executive Lounge for free breakfast each morning and free cocktails in the evening  Everyone was friendly and the rooms were good sized and clean  Bed was really comfortable All in all a great stay   no real complaints other than the key not working the first time we arrived as the front desk had told us the wrong room number Definitely worth a visit to this classic gem  
P => Classic elegance We loved the Drake   rich in history and still beautifully elegant  View of the lake from our th floor room was breathtaking and we loved the bar in the Palm Court  Have stayed at other older hotels in Chicago were from here and do a hotel stay at least once a year and was pleased with the room size for an older establishment  
P => I like the Drake My boyfriend and I stayed here for  nights in ember    I was a bit worried after reading the reviews here and nearly changed my reservation but I am glad I didnt The hotel is beautiful  The room was ok but the bed was the most comfortable bed Id ever slept inThe weather was incredibly cold and snowy during our stay in Chicago but the room was just the right temperatureThe location is ideal right on the Magnificent mile  We didnt eat in the hotel preferring to wander the street to see what took our fancy  THe ole pancake house is worth a tryStaff were friendly and helpful I would stay here again 
P => Dowdy Comfort Stayed one night seeing friends nearby and to experience quothigh teaquot in the Palm Court Room The room was average sized on the seventh floor with a lovely view of Lake Shore Blvd  swinging around to the north and the beach beyond  The HVAC system is quite adequate and you have to turn on the fan to get the solenoid valves on the radiators to open The bed has very soft comforters on it and a simple silk sheet as a spread  The interior is very subdued and I felt that my grandmother Drake no less would feel very much at home here Oh and follow the warnings on the window latches and DO NOT open the windows  They are a quotbreak awayquot types for quick evacuation in the event of a fire  
P => On par with the best of the best     After reading the reviews here we were a bit skeptical    but the Drakes historical elegance cleanliness friendly service and opulent furnishings were on par with the many  star hotels my husband and I have stayed in  The High Tea in the Palm court is a must for romantic couples or a ladies gathering  The ble floors  foot flower arrangements fountain harpist  foot oil paintings and classy furniture all work to create an atmosphere of tasteful wealth that you cant experience for the same price at the other expensive hotels in Chicago  Its right on the Lake near all the restaurants and shopping and the concierge was very helpful to help guests get on the right bustrain to go to the museums  We felt very safe pampered and not ripped off by their rates We look forward to staying there again  
P => Beautiful Hotel So So Stay The Drake is a beautiful historic hotel no question  It reminds me a lot of NYCs Waldorf Astoria which is also now a Hilton property  The lobby ambience restaurants and stores are impressive but the rooms  at least the standard one we stayed in   are not  The rooms or was attractive but it was quiet small  Our bed had a thick duvet and no other choices for blankets so we were very hot The bathroom was attractive but it was really small too  And the towels amp toiletries were disappointing  Basically you would think the Drake would give you luxury but it just doesnt deliver  We had a far more luxurious experience at the Fairmont in Chicago which we had stayed at a few months earlier  So if you want history amp ambience go to the Drake  But if you want luxury amp extras look elsewhere  
P => Wedding itself wonderful hotel just O K  I was Maid of Honor at a wedding at the Drake in y   The handling of the wedding and reception by the Drake was very well done  food was excellent and staff other than valet were exemplary The hotelrooms functions were not so good  I was given an extremely unfavorable room low floor overlooking a tar covered roof with absolutely no view  I am from Chicago and used to seeing the spectacular skyline so the lack of view was not a big deal but I did realize that I had one of the worst rooms in the entire hotel which was dissapointing considering the rest of the wedding party were given upgrades and many of us checked in at the same time  Additionally the bathtub in my room stopped up and overflowed twice in two days  My bathroom sink drained extremely slowly  My air conditioning only worked if I set the thermostat at  degrees the average outside temperature was  The hotel despite being allegedly reated recently seemed very tired and dated  I agree with some other reviews noting a long check in time  There were lines for check in throughout the weekend  Guests at the wedding were subject to lengthy delays at valet parking also The negatives at this hotel were mostly cancelled out by the amazing room rates obtained for this wedding compared to nearby hotels Four Seasons Ritz Carlton Westin however it is sad that such a storied hotel seems to be struggling to keep up with the newer nicer and much better managed hotels around it  
P => A True Classic If you like old world charm and style the Drake in Chicago is for you  The Drake is beautifully orated and appointed  The classic architecture of the s harkens back to a less hectic time  The flowers in the lobby and elsewhere throughout the hotel were magnificent  The Cape Cod Room offers tremendous seafood dishes and the Drake Brothers has a fine selection beef  Enjoy tea time in the Palm Court while a harpist lulls you to relax  In the evening a pianist plays a wide variety of tunes in the Palm Court  The Coq dOr is a fun place to go and meet friends for a drink Even though The Drake is over  years old you can enjoy the convenience of wireless connectivity in the hotel  If you dont have wireless capabilities the hotel also provides high speed internet access in the rooms The staff throughout the hotel restaurants and lounges are all pleasant and attentive which made my stay all the more enjoyable  
P => Gorgeous views are worth an upgrade  Romantic If you love hotels that represent the character of a city the Drake is Chicagos equivalent of the Plaza in New York  Ask for a view of Lake Michigan and Wacker Drive  Youll end up in a larger room on a higher floor and I promise you wont regret the extra cost  At twilight when the city lights up as a cloud of fog rolls in from the lake you couldnt ask for a more romantic sight  Our room was elegant spacious and spotless  Service was formal but not stuffy and the concierge was a wizard  Even the elevators are romantic  With loveseats no less The hotels Coq dOr bar was the first to open at the end of Prohibition and is still a great place to meet for early evening drinks  The bar at the Palm Court feels surprisingly intimate despite being only a few steps up from the iconic lobby   which was orated to the nines for Christmas with carved Venetian angels near the ceiling and a magnificent tree  There are times when I enjoy sleek modern spaces like the W or the Peninsula but for an experience that couldnt happen in any other city you cant go wrong with a lakeview room at this grand hotel  
P => Low grade service at an High Class Hotel I was at the Drake for a conference and the service was TERRIBLE  As far as the sleeping rooms go    The standard rooms were much smaller than I expected for the room rate we were paying  I did not receive my wake up call two mornings in a row  I was compensated with a bottle of wine in my room  BUT    I had to switch rooms because my toilet was stuffed up with a hairbrush from a previous guest  I left the water running a bit too long before getting in the shower and my tub nearly overflowed The conference service was even worse  The hotel doesnt keep all the boxes delivered in the same place so it took almost two hours to locate anything  Unfortunately the location cant be beat  It is right in the middle of the best area in town    ide what is important to you before reserving a hotel room There were a few exceptions of course  Jesse at the front desk was incredibly helpful and the engineers fixing my toilet were very friendly 
P => Disappointing  We arrived five minutes after check in time but the room wasnt ready for at least another half hour  There was an interminable line at the check in counter which really wasnt prepared to handle the quantity of guests that they had Housekeeping was very disorganized  They were still making their rounds cleaning the rooms at  oclock  When I got back from dinner at about  the door had been left open at the supplies station on my floor with various cleaning products left lying out in the hall  There was also a bed yes a whole bed sitting out half blocking the hallway  It was there for at least a few hours but gone by the next morning The room had a somewhat pleasing quotclassic luxury hotelquot or but it was clearly in need of reation  The ugly green carpeting was really filthy and in need of replacement  There was ample closet space but only about four small drawers which were in the big piece of furniture that also held the TV  The TV was mounted on a sliding platform that didnt slide out far enough so that you couldnt rotate it to see the screen from the bed or the couch or anywhere else you might want to watch TV from  The cheesy simulated wood laminate that had been applied to this piece of furniture was stained in a few places and cracked and peeling off in another  There was a safe in the room but it was locked shut when I arrived so I couldnt use it The wallpaper was sort of old and faded and in one place some crusty reddish brown fluid had been splattered onto it    blood perhaps The bathroom had some ble in it which was nice  The sink was partially clogged and drained very slowly  The towels were thin and poorly absorbent and had such a rough uncomfortable surface that I felt like I might get abrasions trying to dry myself off The worst thing of all the noise Besides a slightly annoying level of noise from Michigan Avenue there was a locked door connecting my room to the one next door and I could hear even normal level conversation as though the people next door were three feet from my head  I got very little sleep at the Drake  Soundproof walls are my most important consideration in choosing a hotel and this one was awful in that respect On the plus side The bed was very comfortable with a wonderful down or down like comforter  The air conditioning was plenty strong  Several concierges were excellent  And the lobby bar is a nice place for having a drink  
P => Beware Impressive entrance  Good in house restaurants wthoughtful employees Rooms   old style bathrooms wreally rough towels prob dont get swiped that way no sound proofing   dont rent a movie since most movies have sudden loud sounds neighbors will be pounding on the walls When checked out left items in the room  When back within twenty minutes  items had been taken amp turned into quothousekeepingquot  At front desk they said that they would be brought to the front desk  After  minutes asked again told that they were on the way  After  minutes more told the same again  After  minutes more asked the exec whose desk is next to the front desk for help  He went to housekeeping and returned in  minutes with the items If you ever need to pick up items left behind DO NOT accept from the front desk that quotthey are comingquot  Go immediately to someone with authority for help  
P => Consistently Great I often stay at the Drake on business and Ive always had a wonderful stay  The rooms are always clean comfortable and spacious  The staff is friendly and hospitable  The Palm Court and Coq DOr bartenders are always friendly and accomodating  You cant beat the location because its on Miracle Mile and walking distance from the restaurants on Rush street  
P => Classic lines with a few wrinkles RECOMMENDED  Im only giving this AVG not because anything was wrong simply that for the money its an avg stay  As others have commented this is an older hotel that has been reated several times  Paint is thick on the wood from many years of service  Ceilings high from years were AC wasnt invented  Furnishings of good quality but a bit worn  Check in was prompt  Room was nicely sized quiet bathroom was moderately lighted with ble flooring  Basically the hotel is like a well worn shoe  Its certainly in an excellent location so if you get a good deal on the rate its worth a stay  
P => Not a place Id choose to stay Stayed just  night for a business trip on e   They were out of King beds so I had the choice of a Queen or  Twins  I was told the  Twin room had a better view so I took that  I should have asked for the Queen since the quotviewquot of Michigan Ave was really pretty boring anyway AND I could only look thru an incredibly dirty window which had a little note on the lock that said it was permanently closed  The bed itself was uncomfortable and lumpy so I hardly slept  The room itself is pretty small and a little dark with outdated carpet and bedspreads  Bathroom is also small and the shower curtain smelled mildewy  Towels very rough  Smelled smoke in my quotnon smokingquot room  Room is not real soundproof  Could hear lots of doors closing in the hallway at night  Didnt like how everything in the room including the bottled water and the coffee was an extra charge  Sure its a great location for shopping but the Westin is  door down and theyve got heavenly beds 
P => The Drake has still got it I stayed at the Drake with my fiance the first weekend of  and we loved it  We were very pleased with the service the hotels old charm the quality of the rooms and especially the location We found the hotel was updated but the authentic feeling was not lost  The room bathroom amp linens were comfortable and inviting The only problem was the hotel was too close to some of the best stores Chanel is right in the same building Gucci and Vuitton are stone thows away Hermes is just down the street     very hard on the credit cards We loved the Drake and Chicago     would recommend it to anyone who asks  
P => Classic Chicago Hotel We stayed at the Drake from    and liked the hotel very much  The hotel has great history and tradition and displays it very well  Our room was comfortable although the plumbing was a bit old and the ac a bit noisy  But those were the only minor quibbles we had  The staff is very accomodating and friendly  The room was spacious and the hotel was very quiet  Our king bed was very comfortable and we slept great  The location at the start of Michigan Ave  is convenient to shopping and great restaurants  The restaurants in the hotel are superb possibly the best collection in any hotel weve stayed at  We ate at all  of them and liked the Cape Cod Room the best  The bar at Coq Dor is also excellent  We will stay at the Drake again next time we are in Chicago  
P => Dont let these negative people scare you away Stayed at the Drake for four nights and had a great experience  If you travel to Chicago especially in the warm weather months I cant imagine spending much time in the hotel anyway Staff was helpful and polite   although I didnt have many special requests except for a cot which was delivered promptly  The valet staff and doormen were excellent with directions advice luggage etc  Just be sure to call down in advance   minutes and your car will be ready to go  Rate was  a night prepaid   cant beat that Great location on North Michigan Avenue Shopping Restaurants Etc Check in was fast and painless Bags were delivered to the room quickly Valet was   night Room was nice clean quiet and roomy enough for two men Nice bathroom with lots of room good water pressure and hot water Lots of towels and nice bathrobes View was nothing special from our room Construction across the street causes some traffic congestion in front of the hotel Bottom line Beautiful hotel with great character and an attentive staff  It is not the Ritz or the Four Seasons but for the price you cant beat it There  or  not be a health club and I cant comment on the food as I never ate there  The Drake is a perfect base camp for a trip to Chicago   hundreds of restaurants bars stores and sites to be had within walking distance  
P => Excellent We spent this past weekend at the Drake and LOVED it Excellent service all the way around from the front desk to the bellman  We had a deluxe room and was just the right size  We have stayed at other hotels on Michigan Ave and the rooms were alot smaller at the other hotels  The location of the Drake is perfect  We will stay at the Drake the next time in Chicago  We would not think about staying anywhere else  
P => a once grand hotel is aging the drake is still a chicago landk and in the upper tier of chicago hotels however the years have taken a toll on this once classic landk  the lobby though nice is dated with carpet that needs to be repaired as well as main floor elevators that are also outdated  subtle things such as the paint in the hallways and the look and feel of room doors and design also need work  Paint is chipping off of the doors the carpets in many hallways look worn and in our case the AC in our room did not work Perhaps the biggest indictment of the drake is that it simply cannot hold a candle to the four seasons and pennisula hotels in chicago  A stay in either one of those hotels puts the drake to shame  This is important to note because the drake does consider itself to be a hotel of that caliber  While the name still signifies a classic the Drake hotel has dropped in stature behind a number of other chicago luxury venues  
P => Grand Old Hotel I read prior reviews on this hotel and almost cancelled my res How glad I am that I did not  This is truly a beautiful hotelthe lobby has all the splendor of a Ritz hotel in Europe   The room and bath were lovely  We were on the th floorof the hotel with a fabulous view of the Lake We loved the Club service and bar on the th floor  It hadeverything including a great view I will stay there again first chance I get  It is near alot ofbeautiful shops and restaurants     
P => This is a beautifull place This hotel is beautifull  The last reations brought back glamour and magnificience to the grande dame The staff is exceptional and trully cares unlike other higher end hotels  They will always go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying your stay A very unique place to stay 
P => A tired beauty I live in Chicagoland and have always heard that the Drake was the best of the best We were disappointed   My husband and I stayed for a weekend last month and the room was tired and rundown  The service was great but the room was dark and dingy        Not worth the per night rate Definitely needs a facelift  
P => A Chicago Monument The Drake is a place you have to stay in if you want to stay in history  The hotel is an icon of downtown Chicago  When you walk through the revolving doors and up the stairs you do sense a step back in time  Typical is the th century style chandeliers and interior oration  I love places like that Going to the rooms you have the old fashioned elevators with built in couch and the huge wide corridors  This perhaps explains the rather small rooms as the space used for the corridors didnt leave much over  The bathroom is another antique This hotel is perfectly located as you walk a short distance to places like the Hancock Tower the Chicago river and Michigan Avenue the Magnificent Mile  This is a great place to walk around and if you want to take in a basketball game United Center is a  minute cab ride away until you meet the crowds then add another  All in all the Drake is definitely worthwhile if you want to stay in a Chicago landk  
P => Exceeded our expectations After reading some of the previous postings we were very unsure about The Drake we had planned on staying only one night but extended our stay because of the great service and beautiful room  The front desk extended our stay in the same room at the same rate booked on expedia with no problems at all  Unlike some of the other reviews we had no problems with heating or water pressure  The location was fabulous for shopping on Michigan Ave  we were less than  minutes away from all of the great shops  Overall I would highly recommend the Drake for both short and long stays in Chicago 
P => Hey lets not be so hard on the old dame    Ive noticed that online reviewers tend to be tough on the Drake  I think a lot depends on what your expectations are as you go in  We stayed there for two nights between Christmas and New Years   We chose it mainly on the basis of  location we like to be on the Magnificent Mile and  price a rate of just  per night found on a SideStep search  This gave us close access to the nice shops and restaurants we wanted to try    and let us afford them Yes the Drake is very very retro    almost gloomily so in places  But its also well kept and at a third of the Peninsulas price at least when we were there a good deal  At the reception desk we held out for a better room and for a  nightly increase we got a ior suite very spacious with a ent view but the bathroom though nice was still small plus Executive Lounge privileges which we exploited to the fullest  Were in our late s but given some of what weve been reading in these online reviews we figured wed probably seem like younguns among the Drakes fogy crowd  Not so  We saw lots of young familiies even  somethings  Actually we felt like we were just about average in age here  Overall a nice experience  
P => Very Average We were extremely disappointed with our stay this past weekend  Upon check in we were greeted by a shoe box sized room  I understand that with the older downtown hotels room size varies considerably however at a rate of   night I at least expect a queen sized bed  The thermostat did not work and the heat never shut off  In fact I would estimate our average room temp at  for the stay  The shower  tub did not drain properly  The actual tub was knee high with water by the time I finished a  minute shower  The building is historic and the location is great however based on our experience this is lucky to be a  star hotel  
P => Not so great    The hotel is clean and quaint in that it has a lot of history BUT the service is terrible We called down for items several times and nothing was ever delivered  We were promised a lake front view and got a view of the building across the street  We were promised two queen beds and got ONE queen bed and a cot  Luckily the serviceman got us a second cot  They didnt even bless us with blankets for the cotsDid I mention the service is terribleIm sure you could find a less expensive AND friendler place with the same kind of proximity to everything  I wouldnt stay again  
P => Only ok  I took my mom to Chicago for a Christmas concert and shopping and had high hopes that the Drake would be the perfect hotel Instead they were changing the carpet in the lobby so it was in disarray the service in the cocktail lounge off the lobby was cold at best the closet in our room had a scary hole  ft  x  ft into some air vent exposed  The next morning our breakfast service was spotty the food was cold and there were crumbs all over my seat when we arrived  Yick  Other than a great location I have few other reasons to return  
P => ok hotel Hi all I stayed at the Drake for  days and didnt like it  This is an old hotel with good history as Princess Diana stayed here and other royalties  It was built around s so its old  Apart from that I didnt like the bed   always had a back ache after a night sleep  Room is adequate but the lighting is yellow lights so its kinda eeerie  If youre after an old hotel with european ambiance then its worth a try but if you are looking for more of a modern hotel there are others   I transfered to Wyndham and am happy no more back aches about it  
P => POORLY MANAGED I hosted a group at the Drake in ust  The funny part was that it was  people  The hotel staff were very rude with the exception of the valet staff however I was double billed every day for parking  My group did not receive the correct food that we contracted each day  Nobody was around on the weekend to correct the problem so you were left hanging  I was charged for audio visual items that I never ordered  I complained to management only to receive a letter defending items that were never mentioned in my original letter  Also have left SEVERAL messages for the sales department almost  days later no call back  I would steer very clear of this hotel for any group functions  They are VERY unorganized  The Westin across the street is ten times better  
P => Wonderful Place   My husband and I recently stayed at the Drake for our  year anniversary  I could not have asked for a better place to stay  All the staff were extremely helpful and kind  We had a traditional kg  room and it was very nice and spaceous  We were treated very well and would definately go back again  
P => Great Honeymoon at Drake I reserved a room at the Drake about  months in advance and got a great rate through the Drake webpage reservation other online services did not even come close  Had a lake view  The Hotel is very impressive  The flower arrangement in the foyer is overwhelming  The harpist at the new Drake Brothers Restaurant had us walking around stunned  Easy access to Wrigley via the EL talk to the consierge he is very helpful  Free City tram is great use it walked to Navy Pier and Hancock Ate a meal next to the piano bar requested a song ordered room service sent laundry out free newspaper let housekeeping turn down leave you mints bought the Drake complimentary robesvery nice expensive but nice  Good lifetime memories  Parked car at hotel for  days for   Use public transportation parking is impossible otherwise Tipping works wonders gets you extra little niceties from housekeeping and respect  Dress as you please saw families on vacations and people on business  Going back for our anniversary for sure  Will spend more time on beach ran out of time  
P => Grand as usual Once again the Drake has spoiled me  This was our third stay at the Drake in as many years and every stay is just as delightful as the one before  This time I got a great deal for a room at   I figured for that it would be itty bitty and looking at a roof but not so  It was very spacious and we did look at another building but could see the lake to the left of our window  All of the small things are what I appreciate  The ble sink tops the light fixtures the huge towels and the textured sheets that are sandwiched around the blanket on the large comfortable bed  The flowers in the main lobby are always fresh and beautiful  The front desk gal told us if we didnt like our room just let her know and theyll arrange for another  They managed to check us in early since we arrived earlier than anticipated  We were in our room by  a m  We sat in the tea room for awhile before check in and that was very relaxing  The bathroom in that tearoom is like no other Ive been in  Each stall is like an individual bathroom  The toilet paper and kleenex are always folded to a point no matter where you go  There is some magical fairy that has this job of making them pointed when your not looking  I never want to stay anywhere else when we are in Chicago  The Drake has truly spoiled me 
P => Frank Sinatras favorite Magnificent old Hotel  Sinatras favorite Staff is great  restaraunts are great water pressure is outstanding Offered a   upgrade to room with sitting area per night  lined but will take them up on that tomorrow night Rooms are small as to be expected in a historic hotel but Im sitting here surrounded by thousands of dollars of furnishings wall work heavy wooden panelled door etc This is a subtle but important note as I sit back and notice things  If I look around my room and ask quotcould this be a guest room in a Southern Plantation or Rhode Island Mansionquot my answer is Yes  When I ask that at the HiltonHyattriott my answer is No Then I ask myself quothow many days do I have on this planet how many days do I want to be in a generic boxquotInternet is  day View Lake Michigan or City ask at desk  I took the Lake and have nothing between me and the lake but one road  No buildings this hotel is on the lake Large window says quotCaution Do Not Openquot to appease the lawyers living amongst us  I slid the window up  feet last night  When was the last time you slid a hotel window up Especially a new dark stained aluminum double paned window No screws or restrictors  Gotta like a place that still says quotdont do thatquot but lets you be an American with the choice to do so if you want Phone system is nice  Set wake up call for am  Heard it ignored it rolled over  Went off a second time ignored it rolled over  Security knocked on my door  minutes later quotSecurity just wanted to make sure you received your wake up callquot  I was extremely impressed that they knew part of their job is to make sure I make it to my early meetingThe bar says they served the nd drink in Chicago after Prohibition ended  internal high end restaraunts Right on the shopping wonderland known as the Magnificent Mile across from Bloomindales If youre tired of generic HyattHiltonriott experiences and want a change try the Drake Thanks to BiddingForTravel for allowing me to find out about this hotel 
P => Heart in the hotel I like to express my gratitude to the staff of Drake Hotel which I believe should be credited more than the quot famous lobby itselfquot  The hotel has negative reviews about being an old one  but hey   it is traditional hotel its not the usual hotel nowadays that is technology wise the warmth of the hotel collided with the ambiance that I felt to be a royalty just like the service that c in the bell desk offered me though its late at night he still went to wallgreens to buy a contacts cleanser because I forgot one  The clerk in the front desk ws very helpful in giving some alternatives to my room offering such upgrade and the concierge Adi should be taken in account for   reserving us a nice dinner to a very exquisite italian resto  Very good 
P => So so Attracted by an excellent discounted room rate we stayed at the Drake and had Thanksgiving dinner there last year  People who pay in full wont get what they pay for It was fun to be in the lobby of an quotolderquot city hotel as opposed to the bland environment of so many chain establishments  Some Chicago businesses had advertising displays in cabinetlike niches  Uniformed bellhops bustled about  A towering orated tree heralded the holiday season along with an electric train layout  The entire area was nicely paneled carpeted and appointed  Too bad we went upstairs   The quotfamily roomquot proved to have a good sized double bed and nothing more for sleeping  The couch didnt fold out  Without our having to wait all that long a surly employee brought up a cot which turned out to have a somewhat lumpy mattress  Fortunately we were only there one night Space in the room was adequate  The mirror and glass shelves above the minibar provided a nice touch  The bathroom was roomy and clean  Furnishings were OK aside from the lumpy cot and cheesy radio  There was a ent view of Michigan Avenue to be had from the large windows Dinner was served in a pleasing atmosphere with efficient swift and congenial servers  The food particularly the desserts was less than spectacular given the cost of the meal   
P => Upgrade your room    its worth it Its very exciting to stay at the Drake The lobby is very grand and you can feel the history as you walk in  The front desk staff is extremely helpful  We stayed for two nights and were disappointed with our room the first night  It was cramped and all we saw out our window was the wall of the neighboring business building  We called the front desk and she had nothing else available at the time but told us to call back the next morning for an upgrade  When we called early the next day they said they had a Lake view room for  more  We ided to go for it and did not regret it one bit  It was on the third floor and had a view of the Lake and the road along the lake  It was very relaxing  It was also a much bigger room  Ordered room service the next morning to sit by our window and enjoy the view  The food was expensive by tasty  It was hard to say good bye to this room  
P => Nice but a Bit Disappointing I stayed here recently for  nights and liked the historical charm of the place  Rooms were a bit small and perhaps over furnished but the high ceilings prevented it from feeling too cramped  I had no problem with the climate control in the room  The hotel is old but it seems to be refurbished and not at all run down  My nits not obvious that theres an elevator from the street to the lobby check in steps are daunting if you have luggage and I couldnt understand why they had such cheap  poor quality radios in the room   really diminishes the place  
P => Great Location Great Location and Great Hotel     The staff was perfect and the location could not have been better   The rooms were a little warm the temp controls did not work that well     Opened the window and we were fine Otherwise perfect        
P => Enjoyed Our Stay My wife and I stayed at the Drake in   and enjoyed our stay The bad The rooms are on the small side and the temperature controls in our rooms werent working The good Great service friendly staff wonderful bar  Clean rooms  
P => Beautiful hotel My husband and I stayed at the Drake for our yr anniversary  We stayed for  days and the hotel is simply gorgeous  The staff works HARD to exceed your expectations  The hotel is lovely and has beautiful showcases all through out the area called the quotArcadequot  They have these GORGEOUS childrens black and white photographs and some paintings as well  We even used the photographer they have showcased there and she is just as classy as the Drake  The Drake picked a wonderful choice there This is a class A hotel  Our room was more than we could ask for  The hotel is pricey but what can you expect in the Gold Coast 
P => Great Hotel great location Just returned from a  day break at The Drake  th   th ch  We had a wonderful time  The accommodation was lovely   we had a superior view of Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast which was really beautiful  The general hotel appearance was like something from the s  Sumptuous with lots of attention to details like a huge fresh flower display in the magnificent lobby harpist in the cafe etc  Also the staff at check in and in the restaurants and bars not to forget the room cleaners were friendly and efficient  Its location right on the Magnificent Mile couldnt be faulted   no wonder so many film stars and royalty stay there We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a stylish hotel with a glamorous past  Also Id like to thank British Airways for a super flight out and back and also thanks for the upgrade Super flight super hotel super holiday  
P => full of old world charm Me and my partner stayed at The Drake for  nights in tember  on a stopover to LA we had read the mixed reviews and ided to try it out for ourselves  This hotel is fabulous from the moment we checked in we fell in love with herok the bathroom door didnt close but it all added to its quirky charm  The bedrooms were fine and fresh fruit on every floor was a nice touch  We had a wonderful time and there is nothing quite like having breakfast overlooking Lake Michigan in the Oak Terrace  I would highly recommend The Drake if you want a hotel with a bit of character  We will return to Chicago and certainly stay here again  
P => Loved the Coq dOr I spent a few day at The Drake nad it was wonderful  My room overlooked the lake nad I had access to a special lounge on the top floor that served free drinks all night I also ate and drank in the Coq dOr and this bar was the highlight of my trip  Although  years old te ambiance and service is second to none  I would highly recommend the Coq dOr for giant tinis and great service  The Drake hotel is wonderful    
P => What a great hotel Just stayed  nights at the Drake  ember and the whole place was beautifully orated for Christmas  I had already paid for the room online which was just as well because I arrived at Ohare minus my credit cards I contacted the hotel and they agreed to pay for the shuttle from the airport until I could get my cards replaced  The assistant manager io and his staff were excellent thoughout our stay  Although I cannot comment on the restaurants the Coq dor bar had a great atmosphere and the food was good value     again bar and waiting staff were terrific  One dissapointment was the lack of coffee maker in the room but then again the walk though the hotel to the complimentary drinks every morning was a delight  The hotel is in a great location just minutes from the Hancock building and Michigan Avenue and I would have no hesitation recommending to others     especially when you can get rooms for as little as   a night  
P => Great Christmas Spot I always wanted to stay at the Drake because Ive heard great things  It was everything I had hoped Very classy  Great place during the Christmas season because of all the beautiful orations  Plus it was great for us because its right on the north side of Michicgan Ave so we can shop all day then be right back at our hotel  The service was great and they even gave us a free upgrade 
P => Excellant value Just had two nights at the Drake had read many of the reviews from previous visiters and now see what some people complained about  Yes the bathrooms are missing a shelf some views are not very good etc etc but if that is all you have to complain about then you need to take a good look at yourself I just wish we had stayed a few days later as we stayed th and th   The place is looking amazing with the orations which were just being finished  The giant tree in the loby the Chocolate Sears Tower and the Icing winter scene of chicago with all sweets    absolutely stunning  No complaints with the service the room the package we booked which included breakfast and tickets to the Art Institute  Enjoyed cocktails in the piano bar   I cant think of anything negative to say about the place  Did not eat in the restaurants for no other reason than we preferred to go elsewhere  I proposed to my girlfriend at the nearby Signature room restaurant on the th floor of the John Hancock building which the concierge arranged the reservation and confirmed with me discreetly  Enjoyed the whole experiance and am glad I did it there so we have somewhere nice to go back and remember  Would thoroughly recommend it to any friends or family especially to go during Thanksgiving  Christmas  
P => Complete Joke This is my fathers favorite Chicago area hotel so I thought I would try it out while in the Chicago area  However after thinking about the ol italianate feel of the place and its location relative to what i was interested in etc  I cancelled my reservation favoring the Hotel  which is a pretty darmn nice hotel and thus my problems with the Drake began  In a nutshell they have nicked me for  because they never gave me a cancellation number and I didnt think to get one I just figured that they would take care of it and didnt give it a second thought until of course my credit card bill came  So I have been arguing with them for weeks over aq cencellation number they never gave me and I am at my wits end  In short any place that gives such poor customer service doesnt deserve your business  
P => Not what I expected  My husband and I stayed two nights at the Drake  on ober the th and th  We were expecting luxury like at any Ritz Carltons for example and comfort  We were astonished with the size of the room the quality of the bed no feather bed no feather comforter  The towels were small and old the shower curtain looked all weary  For us the experience was a disaster we booked on the internet a king deluxe and we got a small room with a nice view  I left a long complaint and I am still waiting for their response  I called the front desk to complaint and they never payed attention to my claim  I booked and early check in and they left us waiting for three hours I do not know why Princess Di liked it so much I certainly wont recommend it and stick to Ritz Carlton with my eyes closed

P => Good Alternative This is an apartment NOT a hotel   but its great Getting used to the el train that was mere feet from your window  be an issue and it was for me in spite of the fact that I live in Brooklyn NY just three blocks from an elevated train    but the difference between  blocks and  feet is huge in this case    but if you have a long stay this is a much better alternative than a hotel I went to peapod and ordered groceries to be delivered rather than have to travel on the train to the nearest grocery store  The desk people at the Fisher Building are VERY VERY nice and accommodating and deliveries of all kinds were treated professionally For some reason the corner of S  Dearborn and Van Buren where this building is located is a hangout spot for homeless men  be its the shade be its that they can beg from commuters   whatever the reason they are there almost all the time  As a New Yorker I neither ignored them nor engaged them but rather simply co existed with them as I do here at home  They were all fairly friendly For a long term stay where you want the flexibility of making your own meals in your own kitchen stay here  If you want room service and maid service dont  Personally I loved it  
P => Loved it We loved this building  It was conveniently located in the Loop and near the El  The first floor had retail establishments such as dry cleaners and a convenience store  We also had high speed internet in our room along with the full size kitchen  The furniture provided was beautiful and very upscale  We originally booked our stay because our dhter is moving to Chicago and wanted to check it out  Since we enjoyed the building and the management so much she has ided to live there long term  Bring a blowdryer with you though since one is not provided in the apartment  
P => 
P => Terrible dont stay here  There are much better hotels in Chicago  This hotel is overpriced and lacks amenities found in the simplest motel in any area  No glass in the bathroom bed so small no two people could ever sleep comfortably in it no coffee pot incompetent clerks at check in following a long wait in line outrageous parking fees walls so thin every outside noise is heard  There is only one place nearby for breakfast other than the pricey buffet at the hotel  
P => Excellent location standard room The historic Palmer House Hilton is located within the loop just a block away from the Millennium Park and a few walking minutes to the Magnificent Mile  Numerous shops and cafes are located nearby so offering many choices for breakfast and dinner  The elevated loop metro track with station quotAdamsWabashquot is next to the hotel  Unfortunately this location advantage  be offset by the noise and vibrations from the track  My room did have another suboptimal location with the windows facing the indoor pool  Consequently street level noise was not a real problem but noise from swimming guests did bother slightly  However getting a cell phone signal was impossible in the room  In contrast to other reviews my room was not that small and could be compared to other one double bedstandard rooms in other  star hotels  However the bath definitely was on the smaller side For me the furnishing was impractical  The officedesk chair did look nice but didnt have a real armrest  Additionally the desk was too small for a laptop the telephone and some documents  Working on the bed or in the arm chair was also impossible as the hotel does not have WiFi in the rooms but cable based internet access  Like the bath the TV was small too My request for a later check out time standard  am was fulfilled without the usual additionally costs  For me this was especially surprising as the hotel charges for every other service  The mentioned cable internet for example costs  Dollar per  hour period  The parking garage is located on the opposite side of the street All in all the Palmer House is a beautiful historic hotel with a great location  The rooms are clean and beautifully orated but being slightly impractical and somehow inconvenient  However given the great deal I got on priceline the stay was enjoyable  
P => Dont stay here I have literally traveled the world and this was BY FAR the smallest room I have ever stayed in  The claim to  stars is lhable  The bathroom is a joke  It is so small one cannot even turn around in it  There is no mini bar no coffee maker no place whatsoever to do anything more than lie in bed  The TV is so close to the end of the bed that I had to sit on the bed to squeeze between them The pool closes at pm the gym costs a supplement the ethernet cable costs  for the very basic reception and the line at the hotels reception desk is enough to turn you away  If you want to stay in a small and expensive  star hotel in downtown Chicago then this is your place  If you desire nicer accommodations then by all means keep searching 
P => Good hotel great location  We stayed at Palmer House for  days nights in ember  We traveled with our  year old to see the Thanksgiving Day Parade and visit the Aquarium and the Field Museum We chose this hotel based on its location right off State street close to the Field MuseumArt InstituteAquarium and Planetarium and based on the fact that it has an indoor swimming pool Overall the hotel is nice but considering its agethe way it was build it does seem somewhat dated and definitely lacks any spectacular citylake views Our room had really weird smell so we asked to be moved  The next room seemed much cleaner plus was much bigger even though both rooms were rooms with  queen beds amp  bathrooms We had access to executive floor  had complimentary breakfastsnacks and drinks daily  Breakfast was nothing spectacular  pastries cereal fruit and beverages  but quiet adequate  We ordered room service our st night at the hotel which was very not good  cold food poor taste  We did not eat at the hotel after that  there is a Corner Bakery adjacent to the hotel  great soups and breads Went to Little Italy area for dinner  Leonas on Taylor st  is greatHotel parking is outrageous  I think over night  About  blocks down from the hotel there is a self parking where you can park for night  Cab ride to AquariumPlanetariumField Museum is about  Swimming pool at the hotel is very small  was fine the first few days when there were no other guests there  Our last day there were  or  families in the pool  way too overcrowdedOverall we had a great stay had no major problems with service and felt that this hotel suited our needs well  Next time I will probably try a newer hotel with better viewsamenities  
P => Beautiful lobby  hotel  but poor service  The hotel is grand and the lobby is beautiful with high ceilings filled with paintings reminiscent of the renaissance period  Great location to watch the parade and very central  However my wife amp I did not have a pleasant stay  The service is poor  We realised an error in our package selection romantic package vs  breakfast package which is the same price same room type  We were told quotcomputer would not let them swap it sorryquot one hour after we made the selection  Eventually forced them to get the manager at which point it was resolved without touching the computer   they just swapped our voucher  Walls are paper thin  you can hear the beeps of the safe in the next room doors closing content of conversations etc Re costs the free breakfast voucher only covered the first  according to one staff member the next quotno could have whatever you liked from breakfast menuquot  Internet is  per day for throttled speed or  per day for full speed  To check your email in business centre is   for  minutes use i e  no free email checking  Fitness centre is extra  per day    and so on  Dinner was pp for average buffet that closed before we had finished  Early check out am  Generally   feels like you are staying with large corporation as your host   service is very impersonal and combative   its as if Hilton headquarters has given them no discretion to help guests  Not recommended  
P => excellent stay i stayed at the palmer house in il  with a friend of mine and our  year old kids  this is the third time i stayed at the hotel and it is always a very pleasant stay  the room was large  accommodated two moms and two dhters easily with two large bathrooms  the hotel is great in terms of its historic value and rooms are very well furnished  breakfast was great kids eat free and as a open buffet it was a very good deal  the hotels location is perfect and i could do my work entertain my dhter go to the museums and shop easily  the only downside is the fitness center and the pool  
P => Beautiful Lobby Great Location The hotel was grand It was very beautiful and loved the old photos hanging in the hallways  The location is excellent  It is on the subway line from OHare and easy to navigate the city on the trains walking distance to many things  We had two rooms booked one with two doubles and one king  The double room was lovely and very spacious  The king room was TINY and the bathroom had no shelves for toiletries  However it was clean and it suited our needs  The people next door were loud and we could hear every word the group of women said  
P => Perfect setting for a wonderful weekend in Chicago I got a spectacular rate on Hotwire for the Palmer House Hilton  Upon arrival we requested a room with two double beds and two baths  Thankfully they had one available and were willing to let us have it  It was huge It looked as if they had cut out the wall between two regular sized rooms and taken out some of the furniture  It was so nice to have two bathrooms and plenty of space  Yes the bathrooms are tiny but that is due to the style of the time it was built The lobby is exceptional and there are so many classic historical details that make this place special  The location is ideal as the hotel is near several train lines and adjacent to the State Street shopping area  The theater district is within walking distance as well as the lakefront We had a great weekend visiting with friends and the Palmer House was a perfect place to stay  
P => Historic  I stayed at Palmer Hilton for  days  The hotel is located very next to famous millenium park and is accessible to many attrations such as Art institute of Chicago amp Navy Pier  Palmer has a grand oration inside and you can feel very relaxed atmosphere around the loby amp bar  Front desk associates and even house keeping staff smile at you  I recommend this place 
P => Well reated  Excellent location Stayed while in Chicago for a convention  Booked through Hotwire so the value was excellent  The lobby is magnificent  Hotel staff were helpful  Rooms are recently reated and compact and the bath was small though this was not a problem for me  The location is excellent the only negative is that my room   was next to what must be an internal service elevator  It was quite noisy and ran from quite early in the morning until at least  PM  Avoid all the   rooms  
P => Beautiful historic hotel I stayed at the Palmer House for  nights and overall my experience was phenomenal  The room my friend and I checked into was huge be thats all that was available and it probably why it was so expensive but we had a big room with  double beds and a lounge area in the room  There wasnt much a view but who needed one when the interior was so exceptionalThe highlight of my trip was one of the evening guard staff noticed me taking pictures of the old photos they had of performers who had played in the historic empire room  He must have been performing his due diligence but when I explained I was a guest and I was interested in the history of the hotel I got a private tour of the ballrooms  Be sure to check out their deluxe Starbucks and their fantastic staff  
P => Great hotel great location    Stayed here ober  through ember  for a cconference  This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect  The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short  block walk from the hotel  My room was small but beautiful  The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows  Alas no coffee maker in the room   The staff was helpful and friendly  Id stay here again 
P => gorgeous historic hotel with excellent location this hotel is located in the loop of chicago  its very close to almost all the attractions downtown chicago has to offer  min  walk to navy pier  min  to millennium park  min  to magnificent mile etc  the lobby is beautiful and historic with the elegance of the turn of the century and buzzing with activity  parking is expensive we opted to park at the millennium park garage  mins  away which saved  over  days  rooms were clean but the bathroom small  we got this place for night on priceline and loved it  
P => A Grand Hotel that makes you breathe deeply The Palmer House always causes me to breathe deeply upon entering the fantastic lobby  The Palmer House has excellent lobby life going on full of people sitting talking rubbing elbows socializing and refreshing themselves with drinks and food  I feel this aspect sets Palmer House apart from many hotels that seem nothing more than a line of peoplewith little incentive or space to linger meet and talk to fellow travellers  This historic hotel is packed with art impossibly lavish ball rooms and enough winding hall ways packed with pictures to qualify as a museam of Chicago itself  I took the executive level upgrade and liked that the room was larger and had two bathrooms gorgeous or but the executive level lounge was in my opinion rather depressing offering over priced beer and rather dull and limited snack and breakfast selections  Besides who would want to linger in the executive lounge when you could linger in the lobby with its newly and gorgeous reation of the bar and restaurant  Ive been to the Palmer House many times in  years and am delighted to see it more exciting than it has been in awhile  On this visit to Chicago I stayed at three hotels including the Palmer House the Hotel InterContinental and the Trump Tower  I liked them in the order I listed and found the Trump Tower disappointing and the Palmer House really stands out as a fine hotel worth the expense and I stay in hotels many many times per year  
P => Great Hotel Elegant but small bathroom Palmer House is an elegant hotel with a long history the lobby area is spectacular One the great things about the hotel is the location as it is in the Loop and close to theMuseums parks lakeside attractions  The only issue is the size of the bathroom  verysmall  The room while on the small side was very comfortable  Highly recommend this hotel  
P => Convenient if ugly location   historic interior Convenient to the museum symphony and restaurants  Great Russian nearby  Street level is ugly with the elevated train nearby  The lobby is grand  Stayed in a historic looking room with  bathrooms  Crowded executive lounge  
P => Best Spot in Chicago I stayed at The Palmer House for business travel and had a great experience  The hotel is centrally located to many Chicago attractions making it easy to get around town  The hotel itself is beautifully deocrated clean and reasonably priced  
P => Worthwhile for the Deal We booked this hotel through Hotwire com  Some other reviewers had bad experiences but ours was fine  Staff treated us well and we got a king size non smoking room as reserved  The parking garage is somewhat convenient though you have to cross Wabash to get to it  If you have a vehicle its easy to get in and out  And the location is great near a lot of shopping and parks  Other reviewers have mentioned the small room and I would agree but it was accomodating for two people  The bathroom was okay  Conclusion a clean nice looking hotel with great location and service was worth the price we paid  
P => Nice lobby but small guest rooms tiny bathrooms The Palmer House Hilton is one of the old classic hotels in the downtown Loop section of Chicago  The best things about this hotel are its grand lobby and its convenient location within an easy walk to the Art Institute of Chicago Millenium Park Grant Park buses and trains and plentiful restaurants and stores The front desk check in was efficient but not warm and friendly  The hotel is huge so I had a long walk from the lobby to my guestroom  Many guestrooms are noisy due to the close proximity to the El trains whicgh run right next to the hotel so if youre a light sleeper you can ask for a room away from the El  My room was an interior one overlooking a non descript courtyard  The room was very small and the bathroom was so tiny I could barely close the door without hitting the toilet     probably the smallest bathroom Ive seen in North America and even small by European hotel standards The hotel charges for using its WiFi signal and the while there is a Starbucks on the ground floor of the hotel this Starbucks does not have a free WiFi signal either for Starbucks cardholders  The hotel does have a business center which allows guests to print their boarding passes for free This hotel would not be my first choice but the convenient location is indeed a plus  
P => Impressive The lobby the location and the price Priceline via BetterBidding com were great  It was about  feet from the orange line train stop direct from Midway  The hotel is an old one so dont expect all of the modern amenities  I paid  a night and got a standard room  It was small the bathroom was small and the TV was small  but so was my price  The Starbucks in the lobby and the Corner Bakery a few feet away made for easy morning start ups  I got two good recommendations for off site dining although the few guests I spoke with raved about their hotel meals  I had a cocktail in the lobby while I got some work done  The lobby is worth a look  
P => Grand old hotel great location ent price Stayed over a weekend  Great weekend rates  Grand old lobby  People at the check in counter were courteous and professional  Concierge staff very helpful  Double room on th floor was comfortable spacious and well appointed  Everything was in excellent condition  The hotel is huge and was very crowded with business meetings and private functions throughout the weekend  Waiting times for the elevator were a little too long  Something to be improved  Hi speed Internet connection will set you back at least  per day as quotnominalquot charge  I would go back with closed eyes though 
P => Great Modern Style Surrounded by History and Class I came into town a little early to see my sister but found that I really did not want to venture out of the hotel Being a top tier VIP I was allowed a very early check in and upgraded to the Executive Floor  The room has the classic Hilton bed that you can melt in with expensive linens for class  There was a nice working desk  I found the remodeled bathroom to be cramped when using the commode being a bigger guy  The lobby is exquisite but all is quite expensive within the hotel  Nearby offerings were few as well especially if you were interested in going away from chain food  Services were all expensive including internet and parking There was a large TV with a DVD player in my room on the rd floor  I did notice considerable train noise even up that high so I imagine it is louder on the lower levels For a business hotel this is perfect with easy access to the trains both above and subway level  
P => Fabulous location   great hotel My son and I traveled to Chicago to do a college visit to the University of Chicago  I used Priceline and booked a room for us at the Parker House Hilton  We arrived on the Sunday of Columbus Day weekend also the date of the Chicago athon  I called the day before to check on the bed situation  I was told we had a King size bed in a room too small to put in a folding bed and that they werent allowed to make changes to Priceline reservations over the phone  I was a little nervous when we arrived at noon check in time is  pm  There were  people in line ahead of us not the hordes some people had mentioned  The reservation clerk immediately changed us to a room with  double beds  No fuss no bother  There was a place on the ground floor where we left the luggage while we ate lunch and walked around the city  When we checked in the room was HUGE There were two doubles and you could easily have fit in another double bed plus a folding bed or two  There were  closets and a nice bathroom  All was clean  The bed was quite comfortable  The staff were helpful  The location was wonderful  Just   blocks from the blue line director from the airport   blocks from Michigan Avenue and Millenium Park and Millenium train station   blocks from the loop train  I cant imagine where you could stay that would be more centrally located  It is a beautiful old historic hotel  I loved Chicago and would love to go back and stay there  Well see what happens with the college acceptance situation  
P => Great hotel  worth paying for an upgrade I just returned from a  night stay at the Hilton  The hotel is gorgeous with an amazing ornate lobby  I arrived at Ohare Really early in the morning and they let me check in at  a m  They asked me if I wanted to upgrade to the executive floor  i had gotten a great deal on Priceline so I figured why not for the extra  you get free breakfast free coffee water and soda all day snacks at all times and an hors dourves buffet in the evening  I didnt even have to bother with dinner there was so much food  So paying for that upgrade was definitely a big money saver  The room was lovely  It had a view of the courtyard so not very interesting but it was clean and very spacious  I walked by some other rooms that were not quite so big but they were very nicely appointed  The bathroom was nicely done too ble with crabtree amp evelyn bath products which was nice  Hotel service was great  Everyone was very friendly and helpful  The breakfast ladies worked hard to make sure you had everything you wanted  There is some of the quotnickel and dimingquot that people have been complaining about   like the gym costs money to use  But Id say that the  extra that I had to pay to use the gym is nothing compared to what I would have paid for a stay of this quality elsewhere  I highly recommend this hotel as its a classic Chicago experience and a great value for the money especially if you book through Hotwire or priceline  
P => Beautiful Hotel in Great Location We stayed one night at this hotel and loved it  It was convenient to many downtown attractions  We took a bus up to the American Girl Place and rode the subway back our kids  amp  loved these quotridesquot  Also there is a great pizza place just around the corner from the hotel  Our room was clean and orated very nicely  Room was not huge but it is a historic hotel and it was big enough for the  of us  
P => Historic hotel with great location The palmer is in a great location  It is  blocks from great shopping including MacysHM Sears Nordstrom Rack and close to Millenium Park  The entrance of the hotel is beautiful and the famous ceiling is worth the money  The room itself is a little out dated it is nice but you are really paying for the location and the lobby  The staff is really nice and helpful with luggage  
P => Great Hotel Good Location GREAT cocktails in the bar We got a good deal for a week we went to visit some friends in the city  It was our first time in Chicago and we loved the city  The Palmer Hilton is a  min walk rom the Millenium Park and its so big it takes almost a whole block  It has  enrances The Lobby is simply amazing its like a huge ball room with amazing orations that bring you back to the Golden age of chicago when Frank Sinatra and other celebrities used to hang around in the main dining room that now is used for delux weddings Room we had a ior suit on the th floor needless to say you need to pay attention where u go and remember the room number we forgot and we went around like headless chickens trying to find the room LOLthere are  sets of elevators that take u to different quotwingsquot of the building its not so simple Droom was lovely roomy great bathroom HUGE bed and very quite with desk and a small lobby with comfy chairs to watch the MASSIVE plasma tv  With another huge TV right across the bed  Most of the rooms have been refurbished but some floors are not finished off yet so you might get one of the oldies   I heard this hotel is the only one in the city with and indoor pool and it is the very first hotel that opened in the city too and the HIlton took over in the late s The Bar is great the best cocktails ever one will knock you out  we didnt have breakfast included coz there are so many nice places to eat out that it would have been a waste Staff was great and I would def go back close to the main attractions near macys for the ladies and very close to the metro too  
P => Very nice very convenient        but very very busy Stayed here for a week for business in late y  Tons of people always running around everywhere  Very busy  quotRegularquot basic rooms were nothing to write home about  Just your basic average hotel room  The elevators situation were definitely an issue but presumably this is only the case during the summer months during the week when conferences and conventions are plenty  Paid for an upgrade to the concierge level which was worth every penny  Rooms were nicer the foodsnacks at breakfast dinner time were well received and needed  Would still recommend the hotel    just know that it is not the Drake etc  Pool is quite small and there really is no fitness center to speak of just fyi  Parking is outrageous so find parking elsewhere such as the public lots under millenium park and save a ton     unless your company is picking up the tab and just dont care which is a shame  
P => Georgous Hotel Perfect Location We stayed here on a visit to Chicago during the Chicago Blues Festival this year  Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance  There is a Starbucks in the lobby which is very convenient  Rooms were on the small side but new and crisp and clean  The lobby is a landk  The staff was helpful and friendly despite being a very busy weekend  
P => Lovely hotel Wish we would have had more time to induldge in the perks of the Palme Lovely hotel  Very expensive bar  Try the Bar outside the main doors to the right Millers  great barAlso upgrade to the executive floors for private elevator and night time snacks and breakfast in the am  
P => Wander back to elegance Loved the ornate lobby  Could imagine the many years of fashionably dressed women sweeping down the stairs  Tea in the lobby was delightful  Courteous helpful staff  Rooms were comfortable  Lunch sandwiches delicious  
P => Other hotels offer more for the same or less This is an grand old hotel with the look and feel of a by gone era  The physical plant is quite impressive  I travel quite a bit and amenities like a fridge or microwave are pretty standards items  Not here  If you quotrequirequot either item count on spending an additional   each  Increasingly we rely on our cell phone and internet for communications  Getting a reliable phone signal ATampT was impossible  Hence I missed many important calls business and family  I had to exit the building to get a signal  Internet No wireless is free at many hotels and a quotmodestquot charge at others  Basic internet at The Palmer House   per day and quotHigh Speedquot is   per day  Of course you want high speed  So  days of internet is a    Hotel restaurant food also appears to fall outside of the norm on the high end  Consequently we elected to eat outside of the hotel every day  
P => classic hotel great location Palmer House Hilton was a great choice for my conference due to its location  Hotel was very classic and located in the heart of the city  The train stop direct from the airport was about a  minute walk from the Hotel  Interior of the hotel was very classic and beautifully orated  Theyve also converted the bar to a very much needed restaurant as the restaurants nearby leave little to be desired One word of warning the lobby as grand and nice as it is gets no cell reception on at least  of the major cell providers  This made coordinating meetings there quite difficult  
P => Exquisite lobby in the perfect Chicago location  Just to sit in the gorgeous lobby is heavenly  Drinks are at a tasteful bar or served at the comfy chaircouch groupings For our first stay in early ober we lined an offer to pay   wtax for an up grade to an quotExecutive Roomquot including snacks happy hour hot amp cold hors doeuvresand breakfast  We had to ask for this on our nd  trip and were very pleased  What was missing from both rooms was a coffee maker in the room The location of the Palmer House Hilton is a  minute walk from Union Station less than  minutes to the Art Institute or shopping the Mag  Mile  
P => Beautiful hotel Customer service was wonderful  They would recommend places to go and great places to dine  The subway and bus stops are right outside the doors  Taxis are at your service hrs  The lobby is very beautiful and impressive  The lobby had couches and chairs that were serviced by the restaurant so you could enjoy yourself there  The rooms were small but in a big city that is what I expect  The rooms were very clean and very up to date  
P => Beautiful Hotel I stayed here for a conference  We got a discounted rate since there were so many people booking rooms which made it more affordable but otherwise it would be very expensive  
P => Good Time     Good Hotel It was centrally located     with a Restaurant that was very goodboth for Breakfast amp for Dinner    with a Bar thatstayed open after Dinner   good crowd at the place  
P => Not Worth the money I only stayed at the Palmer House Hilton because my meeting was being held there The hotel is old and shows its age  The bathroom is small and the sinkpost was ducttaped  The walls are paperthin every night I could here the crying baby in the room next door  Saturday night a drunken guest a few doors down woke everybody up with his loud screams throwing of stuff against the walls etc  It took the security guys a long time to subdue him needless to say I was up at  am and couldnt go back to sleep And to top it off I had a room in the front of the hotel where I could here the trains going by every minute until  am like they where right next to me I will never stay there again 
P => Beautiful Hotel Its well worth the price  Its in downtown Chicago and close to transit   
P => Small Room but Nice I wouldnt recommend this Hotel for a Family Trip because the rooms are extremely small however the room was nice  DIdnt have much of a view but we did get it for  on Priceline so I didnt expect a lot  The room was nice and clean and service was great   Lobby is out of this world beautiful if you like old style elegance  Location is perfect for Sears tower Jewelers Row  The Red Line train is just outside the door and the Blue Line is one block over  If youre coming from Ohare you can ride the train for   and get off just  block from the hotel  Concierge was very helpful too  
P => Wanting a special treat for my little  year old mother I booked a room on the executive floor at the Hilton Palmer Ho We were very pleased with the friendly accommodating staff and our great room  We picked up our Go Chicago Card and our Grayline trolley pass in the gift shop there at the hotel  The location was great for accessing parks museums shopping and wonderful dining either by walking or nearby trolley and public transportation  We had a great lunch in the Walnut Room at Macy s a to die for Chicago pizza at Pizanos and a real treat at the Russian Tea House all within a very short walk from hotel  We went to see the Jersey Boys which was within a half block of the hotel  We ate at Portilla s for our Chicago hotdog several blocks from the hotel but Bus  dropped us off within a half block of Palmer House  Mom my two sister s and I made lasting memories on our trip  
P => Would Only Stay Here If I Had To      I would only recommend the Palmer House if you had to stay here  The only reason we stayed here is because it was the hotel for our meeting Here are the disadvantagesService   Service is uneven  I think this has to do with the size of the hotel because its BIG  If the hotel is near full everyone seems overwhelmed  Every call we made to the front desk resulted in being put on hold  There were lines of people everywhere  be things are better when the hotel is not so full Rooms   I dont really understand the rooms  Our room was on executive level  The positive side to this is the top two floors had private elevator instead of the big bank of about  elevators  Our room was modest in size but OK  Bath was tiny  or was kind of over the top fussy style sort of mid s be  I visited friend in regular type room which was spacious with big bath  Regular room had flat screen TV  Executive rooms had older type TVs  Other reviewers have mentioned varying sizes of rooms  I dont think youll know what youre getting until you are there Cost   Others have mentioned the extra costs for about everything  Internet was extra day  Just go to the Corner Bakery on outside st floor of hotel and its free  Other little things   I called in advance to see if rooms had coffee pots and was told yes  Written information in rooms said rooms had coffee pots  There were none   staff said theyd all been removed  All in all Id chose a smaller type hotel if visiting Chicago for fun  I think there are much more comfortable modern and economical places in town  We stayed at the Renaissance Wacker Drive and Burnham before and loved both of them 
P => Pretty but not worth the cost The Palmer House Hilton hotel is stunning in appearance  The lobby and ballroom are stunning  The location is excellent and its only  blocks from the Monroe stop blue line from OHare Airport  The staff is extremely courteous and helpful  The beds were quite comfortable  However  Internet options based on speed range from    day  The fitness facilities cost day  The bathroom is tiny  The water pressure wasnt the best I had to hold the flush lever for several minutes for the toilet to entirely flush  The drain in my tub was clogged so my first shower at the hotel consisted of me standing in  inches of dirty water  However maintenance was called and came very quickly to fix the problem   Parking is day  The room had no coffeetea maker and no refrigeratorThe perks are staff amp location but overall it wasnt worth the amount paid  
P => Beautiful convenient and comfortable historic hotel  I just returned from a  day weekend trip to Chicago and couldnt be happier  The staff from check in to check out was very pleasant  While checking in I asked for an upgraded room and they were able to accommodate me with a very nice room on the Executive Level on the very top floor  I highly recommend the upgrade due to the excellent service you receive as well as larger rooms mine had  bathrooms  orated beautifully the lobby and adjoining corridors were breathtaking  My room was orated very nicely and had only the best in furnishings  It is only  blocks from Millennium Park and the Art Institute  I have been to Chicago several times and this is the best I have stayed in  I highly recommend the Palmer House Hilton  
P => Couldnt have picked a better place One will see a beautiful lobby and an inviting bar  The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and personable  Large comfortable rooms  I had a leaky faucet in the bathroom reported it to the hotel and it was fixed that day while I was out about town It is in the hub of Chicago and public transportation by bus and rail is within a few blocks making it easy to get around Chicago and back to the hotel  All types of culinary experiences are available within walking distance There are   Elevens just west of Wabash one block north of the hotel and one on the south side of the hotel across the street  Both have deli sandwiches for  or less and at the time included a bag of Fritos chips that one can pack for a day of traveling Chicago and save a few  on food  
P => Terrible customer service Very bad customer service  I made the reservation through priceline and called the hotel just to make sure I have  bed instead of   The person from room accommodations asked me how I made my reservation  Once she realized that its from priceline she gave me a lecture on how the rooms booked through priceline are non changeable non refundable non xxxxx and so on she told me the only option I have is to request it upon check in  One thing I wouldnt expect from a four star hotel is such poor customer service  I thought I was talking to my cable or telecom company  
P => A Fantastic Priceline Deal The Palmer is a grand hotel in a great location  No its not new but the lobby is spectacular our room was very pleasant the bedding was to die for and our stay there couldnt have been better  Its a short walk to restaurants bars and attractions or to the El to take you anywhere else youd like to go  Right around the corner is the Exchequer quotex checkerquot restaurant and pub for relatively inexpensive drinks after a long day  Even without a Priceline discount I would recommend the Palmer  
P => Awesome Hotel We loved the Palmer House Hilton  We stayed in room  and it was very nice  The hotel was in a great area  We did alot of walking but we pretty much walked every where  There is a great breakfast place on the corner from the hotel  A couple of doors down we got an awesome deep dish pizza  The pictures that you see of this hotel is exactly what you get  We also bid on our room and got it at a great price  
P => Some nickle and diming This is a fine hotel if you can get it at a discounted rate from Priceline or some other service  Clean but small rooms well located in the middle of the Loop next to several subway lines pleasant staff  The only thing that bugged me is that its one of these places that tries to charge you for things many hotels include in the price of a room  Wireless Internet Sure sir we have three different price tiers  Gym Of course  That will be   I got there at  a m  and was charged  for early check in  I was told that if I didnt want to pay to check in early I would have to wait until at least  p m  but that they couldnt guarantee me the king bed I had requested  However   lucky me   they had one available now for the extra charge  All of this was done in a friendly professional way by the nice lady at the front desk but it still left a big of a bad taste in my mouth  
P => Dirty towels and tiny bed I stayed at Palmer House with my husband on two consecutive weekends    and    and on both of them the experience was not pleasant for different reasons At the first time we were given as well as the other couple travelling with us a very tiny bed about ft   m wide  It was so small that my husband actually fell of the bed once  We couldn t move much during the night with the risk of falling of which made sleeping quite uncomfortable  The room was also very small there was the bed and minimum space to walk around it and a small dresser with tv on top the smallest hotel room Ive ever been to We asked to change rooms and like the other couple we heard that they had nothing else to offer and that we shouldnt book through priceline com next time What a shameNext stay was already booked and pre paid so we ided to go anyway  At check in we already begged for a bigger room and since the hotel was not so full they granted us a king size bed room  The room was at least twice as big as the previous one which was very good  For my surprise after I found a dirty towel among the supposedly clean ones lipstick ks  I complained and of course they deeply apologized and brought us a new one  Next day I found on the night table one french fry and a Mc Donalds ketchup and we hadnt eaten thereCleanliness was clearly very poor on that second stay  Besides bathtubshower combination drain was working poorly so we damped our feet on about  ft deep water even when showering which I find very unpleasant  Called maintenance it stayed pretty much the same and we where left with a dirty toilet full of maintenance guys footprints and still not working It was not expensive considering location   dollars per night but I will search for another hotel next time Valet parking is vey expensive  dollars a day but thats a poblem of the location not the hotel Location is though VERY good near Millenium park and other sights  
P => Beautiful hotel stunning lobby and great accomodations We booked a room on Hotwire and stayed overnight this weekend  We got a room with double beds and the room was spacious with a nice sitting chair with ottoman luxurious bed linens nice tv desk chair and a small but adequate bathroom with ble countertop  The location is fabulous just a block away from Millenium Park  We parked at the Millenium Park garage enter off on Monroe St  for just less than  hours for  I hear it is day and walked the two long blocks to the Palmer House  Check in was quick on a Friday afternoon  The lobby was bustling but not overly crowded  We ate at Millers Pub a friendly place around the corner then headed east on Monroe toward the lakefront to watch fireworks off of Navy Pier and played outdoor mini golf at a place right on Monroe and Lake Shore Drive fun and charming place that served bar food and drinks outdoors  Saturday was Michigan Ave  and lunch at Bandera pricey but amazing burgers and lots of window shopping  Weve stayed at many different downtown Chicago hotels over the years  I really think the Palmer House Hilton is a nice hotel in a terrific location and is worthy of its four star rating  
P => Great priceline stay I placed a  bid on a  star hotel in the millenium park area and we ended up with this hotel  My husband and I were both very happy with this hotel  The ambiance is magnificent  Lots of high ceilings very rich contemporary or  The rooms were standard size for a DT Chicago hotel  Basic amenities and we ended up with a great view on the th floor  The concierge was very helpful with recommending restaurants  If you are going to see Jersey boys the theater is across the street from this hotel  Were were able to walk a few blocks from Union Station to the hotel and on to Millenium Park State St shopping and even the restaurant we dined at for dinner which was off Congress and Dearborn  Everything was close by and for the price it was a great deal  
P => Great Location no  Star Great locationQ block from from Michigan Ave Millenium Park Museums Soldier Field  Rooms are REALLY small and bathrooms are tiny  No mini bar mini refriderator or refreshment center in room  Comfortable bed  Be sure to ask for room on opposite side of L train  L runs  feet from the building every  minutes  
P => Would Stay Again Valet could not handle the van with a top nor could self park garage a block away  Is a Surface Lot a block south which worked but watch attendant as tried to double our cost from amount posted After convuluded parking experience were tired  Business services on lower level as well as Star Bucks  In the afternoon hotel has Tea and those patrons were just finishing up  Check in   PH was very friendly and efficient  We on the executive floor  Specific elevators for specific floors  Staff had contact with not afraid to make eye contact and assist  Room lovely  arate bedroom from livingeating area Plenty of seating comfortable linens  Bathroom very tiny  Executive Lounge cash bar starting     SodaCoffee etc avail throughout day  Continental Breakfast complete  Ck out efficient  Theatre quotMillers Pubquot and even drug store within a block area of hotel  Loop Museums etc all easy walking from hotel  
P => Definitely would stay again  Beautiful hotel walking distance to most everything cleanand fun  We stayed on one off the executive floors we enjoyed a nice breakfast and snacks dudring the day along with happy hour from  pm  Thanks Palmer House 
P => Rough start turns into great stay Booked two rooms on Priceline for  each about the same as the cost of one room through Travelocity  Priceline only guarantees space for two people and we had three and didn t want to take a chance  During our stay our plans changed and we needed to book another night downtown only one day in advance  The Palmer House desk offered a rate of  and Travelocity was offering   So I again went to Priceline this time bidding   It was accepted by the nearby Hyatt  Rough start    On our initial arrival at the Palmer House at  p m  on Saturday t   we were told the hotel was sold out and there were only nine rooms not yet occupied and all were being cleaned  We would not have a choice on the type of rooms and were given a King Bed Smoking and Two Doubles Non Smoking  We were told the wait would be   minutes and that they would call our cell phone when the room was ready  In return for our wait the clerk gave us  in vouchers to the Lockwood restaurant which is the priy dining offering  We waited about an hour and finally went to the desk where staffing had changed  We were told one room was ready that we could check in and that they would deliver the key to the second room when it was ready  At  p m  more than two hours after our arrival I went to the front desk and had to wait in line for  minutes before getting the key to the second room  It is also worth noting that the bellman service for bags was not really optional  We were not allowed to grab our own cart and handle our own bags  They took the bags to a secure holding area and then brought them to our room after check in  We ended up tipping twice there The rooms    The smoking room really smelled bad upon entering but we adjusted quickly and stayed there all three nights even though we probably could have moved on the second day  It was spacious enough for two  The room with two doubles was a little tight but still would have been acceptable for three people given the low price  The beds and pillows were as good or better than any hotel we have ever stayed in  Really fantastic  Both rooms were well equipped with shampoo iron blow dryer etc  The TVs were outdated  inch tube models  The  classic  d cor was not to our taste especially the garish curtains but more pleasant than we expected from photos found on Flickr and Google Images  Public spaces    This is where this hotel shines and why I would go back again and again  The Palmer House was once the world s largest hotel  The lobby is world class spectacular and adjoining spaces such as the elevator entry rooms are quite special  The three mornings I spent in the lobby waiting on family members with my coffee more than made up for any shortcomings  They play background music in the lobby and elevators that includes some soothing selections and some Dean tinSinatra type stuff from the heyday of the hotel Apparently Sinatra played in the Empire Room just off the lobby Food    There is a Starbucks in the hotel on the ground floor  The Lockwood restaurant was very nice but too pricey for our tastes if we hadn t had the vouchers  We used the vouchers on two mornings and for  we got four breakfast buffets  ea a Belgian Waffle  and some coffee and sodas  The breakfasts were good but the basic items we chose eggs potatoes sausage cantelope were really no better than most free buffets offered at chains like Holiday Inn Express  Location    Great  About two blocks from Millenium Park and the Art Institute right next to the train loop and State Street Subway entrance and about three blocks south of the river The subway was handy to get to north Michigan Ave  within about five blocks of the contemporary art museum  Eateries near the hotel include a Corner Bakery next door Miller s Pub around the corner classic steak roast beef and ribs with many entrees under  an Italian place in the next block and the Berghoff brewhaus and German restaurant about two blocks away  Also two Irish pub restaurants within about three blocks right off the river on State Street One had  oz Angus burgers with fries for   A CVS is across the street and there is lots of shopping within a couple of blocks including TJ Maxx and HampM  In the past we have stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn which is near the north end of Michigan Ave  and I found on this stay that I prefer the character of the loop Parking    To avoid the night valet cost I parked at the Grant North underground garage below Millenium Park  Its pedestrian entrance is just over one block from the hotel  It was very convenient and cost  per day  The timing of our limited car use made this work  If we were making multiple trips the free inout of the valet might have been more attractive  
P => Very Nice This hotel is definitely a great place to stay while in the city  The lobby and restaurants are fantastic and posh  The rooms are clean and the bathroom was ble tastic  I definitely recommend  especially since you cant beat the location as it is very close to Millennium Park and the Art Institute  
P => Priceline is the way to go Having won a bid for night on Priceline we knew what to expect given previous reviews  I would highly recommend whoever plans on staying at this hotel become a Hilton Honors member its free and allowed us to bypass the fairly large line up at the regular check in desk  Although we were not lucky enough to be given a room on the executive floors for free day for the upgrade as it was labor day weekend the hotel was fully booked  We were fairly satisfied with our room  It was on the th floor away from the El track but facing one of the internal courtyards with a view on the opposite facing rooms  It was quiet but again one cannot choose their neighboors and we were surrounded by families with children  Anyway given the small amount of time we spent in our room all this didnt matter very much  The cleaning crew was fantastic and all the staff we encountered very friendly and professional  We also used the business center on the th floor to print out boarding passes for free any other use of the Internet has to be charged on a credit card you swipe yourself  The Lockwood cafe offers  pm tea time at a cost of person a little steep so we opted to skip the english sandwiches and scones  However for those looking for a nice afternoon tea in beautiful surroundings will probably not be disappointed  
P => Cant say enough great things about the Palmer House I can not say enough great things about the Palmer House Hilton  We had a great stay The hotel is absolutely beautiful Very clean and orated nicely  The beds were so comfortable we didnt want to get up every morning  Our room was very spacious with two double beds and two full bathrooms The staff was very nice and helpful  My only complainant would be that on a Sat  morning during a holiday weekend there was only one concierge at the desk and it was very busy  Great location too Just blocks away from Millennium Park downtown shopping the Chicago Theatre and the River 
P => Perfectly unrekable but a good location First off the positivesThe Palmer House Hilton is well located in the Loop particularly if youre going to be using transit  Its on Monroe between State and Wabash in the heart of the Loop with the Monroe Red Line El stop directly outside its State St  entrance and the AdamsWabash el stop outside its Wabash entrance Green Orange Brown Purple amp Pink lines  The Monroe blue line stop is a block west The old world lobby is gaudy and grand and perpetually busy  The staff is for the most part very friendly  Theres a Starbucks one level below the lobby caveat The prices are higher than at a non hotel Bucks The cozy rooms are clean if uninteresting with the standard Hilton or  Housekeeping was excellent The hotel despite being older features a pool and health club BUT       Again the rooms are small and the bathrooms are TEENY as in moderate price London hotel bathroom small  Also the in room televisions are dated  Get with the flat screen program people  Waiting on the elevators at check out time on a Sunday will test your sanity For the  per night rate I got on Priceline the Palmer House was more than fine  I didnt spend a great deal of time in the room anyway so the small rooms didnt bug me that much That said I wouldnt pay the rack rate for this hote  
P => Excellent location beautiful hotel showing its age My wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway excursion  I didnt choose it    Priceline gave it to me for   If Id paid the book rate  Id have been less pleased  No troubles with checkin  Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable  Starbucks in the lobby was a godsend  Id read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough  For  its a steal  For its online face value not so much  Will definitely return if can get similar price  
P => Clean Comfortable Room Expensive Everything Else The Palmer House Hilton Hotel is located in downtown Chicago a few blocks from the Willis  previously Sears  Tower and right on the L train  It is an excellent location  The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms are clean  Its amenities are expensive though  Internet access is over  daily  The hotel charges for toll free calls  And parking is  daily  I could not get cell phone coverage in my room so any attempt at communicating with the outside world would have cost me   unacceptable for such an expensive hotel  
P => A well oiled hotel machine in the heart of the Loop Many enormous hotels suffer from their size but Palmer House doesnt  Check in is faster than youd expect at a huge hotel  When I arrived it was noon and too early but the friendly receptionist checked me in and did everything but give the keys   that was great because when I returned about an hour and a half later it only took twenty seconds  The concierge had thoughtful recommendations because he asked good questions about what we were looking for rather than just make quick automatic suggestions  The luggage storage valet was happy and efficient  in holding bags before getting into the room and after we checked out This is how a well oiled hotel machine should run The room was spacious with a small adjoining bathroom remember this hotel was built waaaaay back when standard room bathrooms were built that way plain and simple  Amenities are similar to Hiltons nationwide  The location is perfect for city exploration leave the car at home youre either a walk or an El ride from everything  Be sure to take advantage of the Corner Bakery Cafe located quite naturally on the corner Booked through Priceline   it was a steal at under  a night for an exceptional location and smooth as silk service  Oh and we saw members of the Dream Team  Olympic basketball team there 
P => Beautiful but pricey First trip to Chicago  great city Clean and safe at least on the east side at this location  Big beautiful lobby staff was somewhat snobbish  Room was beautiful and clean but a little small  Double bed but worked for us  Comfortable and clean thats usually all that matters  Got a great deal  a night on priceline incredible deal  Just watch out for extras like internet   a night and parking even worse  a day You even had to pay to use the gym At least we saved on the room  We called to ask the concierge about local biking etc he was rude and said quoti already told you thatquot  Apparently not a star customer service  Our room was on the executive floor so there is a complimentary coffeedrink room during the day and complimentary continental breakfast only on our floor  Also a complimentary computer with internet and printer if you need it  I preferred to use my own room  So pretty nice for a  star pricey hotel if you get that floor  You had to have a special key to even get onto it  Hotel is very close to site seeing like Lake Michigan amp Sears Tower  Great deep dish pizza right around the corner  We would definitely stay again great time in chicago and at the palmer house 
P => Beautiful Old Grand Hotel I have been fortunate enough to stay at the Palmer House on several occations  When you think of extravegent hotels from the early s the Palmer House has to be near the top of the list  One chooses the Palmer House because of its history  It is not flashy  Modern hotels  have more ammenities but they lack the charm It does not matter how many times I walk into the lobby it is stunning even opulent  At Christmas time there is a tree that is beautifully orated that stands at least  feet tall  Check in has always been fast with pleasant help  I have found the concierge to be most helpful  Ask about the hotels past  The concierge will gladly tell you  They will even give you a packet of information The rooms for the most part are small  The hotel was built almost  years ago  This was the style  Yes the bathrooms are small and lack space  Again early s One thing about the rooms that no one should complain about are the beds sheets and blankets  I believe the beds are Serta Serenity series  They are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on including my own I like a harder surface  My wife likes a much softer one  We both agreed that this is the next bed we will purchase  The sheets and blankets are very comfortable  I get hot  My wife gets cold  Again we were both comfortable  I agree with other reviews that the carpet could be updated  Other than that the rooms are quite clean The hotels fitness center is the best I have seen  It is not just a room that has been converted into a health area with one treadmill and an eliptical  This is a mini health club  The pool  not be olympic size but one can still swim laps unlike most new hotel pools I have read several reviews of the pricey parking  This is true but parking is pricey anywhere in downtown Chicago  If you drive just plan for it as part of your expenses One of the best parts about the Palmer House is its location  The Magnificent Mile is just a few blocks away  Major sight seeing venues are easily within walking distance the Sears Tower Shedd Aquarium Field Musium the Art Institute just to name a few  Catch a play at any of the several theatres near by  One will not want for great food  There are a ton of great restaurants within walking distance or within a short cab ride away  Millers Pub established in  has fantastic food  It is one of those places that celebrities throughout the ades have flocked to  The place is jammed with autographed photos from the restaurants beginning to the present  The Berghoff is less than five minutes away  Take a cab north five minutes  You have your choice of Ditkas The Weber Grill Smith amp Wollensky Wild Fire    The list could go on forever The bottom line is if you are looking for a flashy new hotel with all of the modern ammenities this is not the hotel for you  If you want to experience what life was like for the upper crust a nearly a century ago give this hotel a try  Do go through one of the on line travel sites as the rates are quite high  
P => Upgraded Room Makes the Difference I won the Palmer House for an insanely low price on Priceline but grew worried about what type of room we would get family of four staying  days  I had stayed here  years ago and remember having a lovely room with two bathrooms and hoped we could get the same but I doubted because of our Priceline price  At check in I ided to just go for it and told the check in man very nice guy I had stayed here before and upgraded to the executive floor with two baths for night more  He said no problem  This still put my average nightly price at under   We stayed on the rd floor where the executive level reception area was located and our room was absolutely beautiful and was HUGE  We had breakfast ever morning includes coffee which is not avaialbe in room appetizers they were pretty awesome every night and access to a computer in the reception area any time we wanted my kids would go down there when bored and play until an adult needed to use the computer  oftentimes they had to to themselves for an hour  There are arate elevators for Executive level floors that only stop at the th  and rd floor and we never had to wait for an elevator  The only issue we had with the room was the last night a family checked in next to us and we could hear them plain as day through the walls but since our bathroom area backed into their bathroom area it was only noticeable when we were in the bathroom We tried the pool which is free contrary to many reviewers though the fitness center has a cost on the th floor and were disappointed  Was small and unwelcoming my kids ditched it after ten minutes The location is great and my kids really loved Millenium Park playing in the water and we saw an open air concert the first night we were there  It is literally a two minute walk away  We walked up north of the river several times and it really only took us   minutes to get up to shopping on Mich avenue and the Hancock building  We would walk to Navy Pier and take a cab back   We even walked back from Shedds Aquarium along the waterfront  minutes   Two restaurants we recommend are just south of the Palmer House  Millers Pub and Exchequer great deep dish  Skip Pizanos around the corner long wait and average food  Didnt eat at the hotel  Corner Bakery a good option for a quick bite  Parking was expensive  Use self park which is just east of the hotel on Monroe for a night savings  I understand there are several other options within walking distance so you can research and if you dont mind rolling your bags a couple of blocks we saw many people doing this then you can save even more  I think choosing the upgrade made our vacation more pleasant but if we had been stuck in one of the smaller rooms the whole time without access to the free beverages food computer and concierge of the executive level we  have been less pleased  
P => Great place Great city My sisters and I traveled to Chicago from Michigan from ust th to th  The Palmer House was a great hotel  We had a great experience overall  We booked the hotel via Hotwire com and received a great deal  From the moment of arrival to the point of departure the staff showed a great deal of hospitality and warmth throughout the entire stay  The lobby of the hotel is so beautiful  The hotel is moments from Millanium park and Michigan avenue a bus ride from the shedd aquarium and the chicago zoo which has free admission Suggestionspark at the Millanium park parking garage  It cost us  dollars to park for three days  Compare that with the  dollar valet at the hoteleat at the corner street cafe on wabash street i believe  A few feet outside of the hotelDO NOT WALK OUT PAST  pm raoming the street  How come someone failed to inform us that many locals are roaming the street harrassing touristGarrett Popcorn on state street  
P => Great Deal for the money We booked a room here on Priceline and altho the room and bath was small it was clean and pleasant  Couldnt beat the negotiated price and the location was central to everything we wanted to do in downtown Chicago  A beautiful old hotel with a history and lots of atmosphere  Also they have a quotbusiness centerquot on the th floor where you can print boarding passes for free One drawback is lack of free internet service in the room  Expensive restaurant IN the hotel but more reasonable ones just outside or closeby   We were very happy with what we got  
P => Mob luxury but outdated service too This hotel is perfect stopping off point for walking around Chicago and visiting many of the most famous sights  They are all within shouting distance of the main entrance  I booked through Priceline and they accepted just  per night   usual rate  so no complaints there  The rooms are luxurious looking but the fixtures and fitting are all very old  Theres a Starbucks in the lobby so no coffeetea facilities in the room  If you can get it through Priceline for something like I paid for it it is perfect but their standard price would be far too much 
P => Very Disappointing The location of the Palmer House Hilton is good for business travelers but tourists would probably want to stay north of the river where there are more restaurants and shops  If there are no conventions in town two bills will fetch you a small room on the alley with no view except looking into other guests rooms The begger on the street corner welcomes you to the Palmer House  The registration desk is on the second floor up a couple of flights of stairs which is tough with a rolling bag  The   minute average wait for the elevator is silly  The distance from the elevator to your room can be a workout My room on the th floor had a strong smell  At first I thought it was cheap truckstop perfume but ided the staff must have spilled a bottle of orange scented cleaner  Unfortunately the cleaner was not used to clean the tiny bathroom which still had a wet towel from a prior guest  The room had ancient carpet that was bunching up into waves on the floor  The wallpaper was peeling as was the paint on the bathroom door  The HVAC was either all or nothing  The double beds were OK  Being an avid duck hunter I stay in some dump motels in the countryside but the Palmer House is the first place where I ided it was best to keep socks on at all times to avoid fungus The first morning the wakeup call didnt arrive due to hotel computer problems  The second morning the maid staff was pounding on the door before the  wakeup call arrived I was told that I was given a quiet room at the end of the alley but I could hear the elevated train that runs next to the hotel all right long  I wear hearing aids and consider myself a sound sleeper so I cannot imagine what light sleepers would think The Corner Bakery and Millers Pub around the corner provide good alternatives to the high prices and low quality of food in the hotel The lobby of the hotel is interesting but I would recommend staying at another hotel and just stopping in for a drink but at  for parking take the subway  blocks west on Monroe or the EL literally adjacent to the building  
P => Some Call It Elegant    I Call It OLD I have just spent  nights at the Palmer House Hilton on business attending a conference and hated every night of it  The rooms are small and cramped and the hotel itself is badly in need of a facelift  If you happen to get stuck at this place however dont let them assign you a room on the th Floor or above  Since the hotel was probably near capacity the elevators were constantly full with conventioners and it took more than  minutes every single time I had to wait for the elevator  As a result although I am an HHonors Elite member and they upgraded me to the Executive Level on the rd Floor I actually went to the front desk and asked to be downgraded to a regular room on the th Floor or below since they have twice as many elevators servicing these floors as they do the th floor and up  Bottom line   this place is a dump especially for the money they charge and there are tons of nicer hotels in the vicinity for the same price or less  And oh self parking is  and valet is  and it costs  per day to use the gym unless youre a HHonors Diamond and  per day for internet usage  Talk about a ripoff 
P => A great experience at a great hotel I last stayed at the Palmer House for a convention back in  and I must confess that although my first experience wasnt negative I was floored by how great my stay was this summer  Upon checking in I was greeted by a warm and friendly lady at the front desk and when I got to my room I was just astounded by how large it was I had a room with two double beds and the room was probably twice the size of what I expected  The beds were truly the best that I have ever slept upon and the or was quite visually appealing  I stayed three nights but if I had unlimited means I probably never would have left  
P => I was so impressed Location  Fantastic  It was in the middle of everything Price  not bad  I got a king sized bedroom for   a night on hotwireAppearence  WOW The hotel is simply breathtaking Service  good  Very nice maids Hygene  good  our room was so clean for all  nightsdrinks  very good  but a little pricyspa  dont good  not worth your moneypool  it sucks  its small and loudThey are very accomdating and the doormen are nice  
P => Fabulous Location This was a Southwest airlines package deal  We had never been to Chicago before and were unsure of the overall outcome  We flew into Midway and for   each we took the train directly from the Airport to the entrance to the hotel  It took approx   mins  A cab probably would have been    The hotels Lobby is old world style elegant within walking distance to many of the cities major attractions  Millenium Park Art Institute of Chicago Willis Sears Tower  We even walked down to the Field Museum GREAT and the Aquarium and Planetarium  The Corner Bakery outside the hotel is delish and a good breakfast value  
P => An elegant trip to the past    My husband children and I just returned from a trip to the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago  Upon check in the staff offered us the option to upgrade for  a night to an Executive Suite  The room was lovely    bathrooms and very comfortable beds  Our own concierge complimentary drinks and a very quiet stay made for a wonderful stay 
P => Great For Business Traveler   Know Your Expectations I have stayed at the Palmer House many times  When travelling by myself its the best place in Chicago  As long as you know a few things going in youll be fine     I only stay here if I am in Chicago on business  If I am bringing the family we stay at the Embassy Suites   Chicago Downtown which is up State Street on the other side of the river  The rooms at the Palmer House arent big enough for a family of    Since I am a HHonors Gold member I get access to the Executive Level for the continental breakfast evening snacks and complimentary soft drinks water etc  No matter what floor your room is on I just head up to the Executive Level once a day to stock up on the beverages and bring them back to my room  The location is great   in the loop at Monroe  Wabash  State  Right outside the hotel you are steps from the CTA train  No need for a car  If youre coming in from Midway take the Orange Line to Adams  Wabash  If youre coming in from OHare take the Blue Line to Monroe and its just a block walk or transfer to the Orange Line at Clark amp Lake  The hotel is close to the museum campus  The rooms and beds are great especially after the remodel over the past couple of years If you can get a rate anywhere from     its a great value  Anything over that is a stretch  
P => Good value for good price Ive been there with a group  Nice localisation close to shops good service  
P => Good Location at a Good Price We made the Palmer House Hilton our home base while traveling to Chicago in early ust  I was able to obtain a very low online rate  and given its location it wasnt going to take much to meet my expectations paying that kind of weekend rate in the Loop  I had read many of the posts on this site so thankfully I went in with eyes wide open and knew some of the things others had complained about  All in all the rooms were small and there certainly werent any extras  The small rooms made it difficult with young children  There were two double beds and no other space in the room to spread out  The beds became our game tables snack tables chairs and sleeping areas all in one  Thankfully we didnt travel to Chicago to spend a lot of time in our room  The location of the hotel was great  We were within a couple blocks of the Art Institute Millennium Park Grant Park and plenty of dining options  The nearby CVS and Walgreens are also nice to have when you need those essentials  We picked up a local bus route right outside the hotel and the L station is a mere block away  Traveling with young children I was certainly disappointed with the pool facilities   very small and not a very bright welcoming setting  We didnt have many needs for service but the staff at the front desk were very welcoming and friendly when we checked in   even after dealing with some rude people in front of us  For the price we paid I was thrilled with the hotel  Paying full price I might check other nearby options on a future trip  
P => The Smallest Room Ive Ever Had Four colleagues and I all commented that we can never remember having smaller rooms  It was difficult to open the closet door since it hit the bed  I tried to iron something and wound up with half the ironing board hanging over the bed The place was bustling with convention goers which made the wait for elevators at least ten minutes at all times of the day  Even with modern soundproofing the rumble of the elevated train was present and the hallway noise was particularly irritating The main lobby in beautiful that cannot be denied but a hotel needs more than that to be good  
P => Palmer House Perfection We stayed for several days and nights at the Palmer House in Chicago Illinois We were able to walk and visit different shops and sights and had a great time each day The Palmer House experience began with the bellboy who took our luggage to Noel who checked us in to Eduardo who brought our luggage to our room  Each individual made it a point to welcome us and wish us a great stay  They truly meant every word The last night we saw JERSEY BOYS which was excellent  returning to the Palmer House the doorman said quotwelcome back quot It was GREAT to be back and we truly felt like we were home  The Palmer House is a great location for seeing everything that you want to see in Chicago We ate in the Lockwood restaurant which is located in the Palmer House  The food was excellent and the dining experience was great  The service was tremendous  Between the Manager Luis our waiter and Jake the Captain we felt that we had a million dollar meal and it was truly a great experience  Another fine restaurant around the corner from The Palmer House was Millers Pub and Restaurant  We had the best ribs we ever had there  Kiki our waitress was a great server  We bought their barbecue sauce which was excellent  The Palmer House was unlike any hotel that we have visited  It is a beautiful Hotel that takes your breath away when you look up at the ceilings when entering the building  The atmopshere and the location made us have a wonderful and needed vacation The people that we met in Chicago were wonderful  
P => Thank Goodness I listened to my husband       My husband had to attend a conference and the Palmer House was the hotel of choice  I read up on some reviews and frankly was somewhat put off by some of the reviews  But given that the hotel costs were covered I reluctantly went along  Oh boy what a pleasant surpriseWe were at the Palmer House for  nights and our room had a view of the street  And yes you could hear the faint clickity clack of the L but it added to the urban charm  And no I am not being sarcastic  Old Chicago elegance is epitomized in the lobby  We didnt have time for drinks but next time you bet Ill be there  Efficient and professional front desk staff  We needed extra towels and toiletries and housekeeping efficiently took care of us  The small safe in the closet was much appreciatedSince my son and I were sightseeing while my husband worked we would get up late and lunch at The Corner Bakery next door  A nearby CVS was a great convenience  Starbucks in the lobby The Art Institute is down the street as is Millenium Park  I NEVER take the bus in LA but Chicagos bus system and the L is fabulous We took the L from Midway Airport to the hotel the stop is less than  block from the entrance     adult      LOVE IT Were a green kind of family so what more could you askOnly negative thing I could say the   day charge for internet access  Ah well cant have it all My first time in Chicago       Im coming back AND staying at the Palmer House  
P => Nice on the surface but just underneath lies problems When I first checked into the Palmer House last week my impression was very favorable  It is a beautiful hotel well located and the room I was in was large although the bathroom tiny  However that was before I learned about Hiltons nickel and diming at every turn  Just a few examples  Rooms did not have coffee makers and it cost you minimum  plus room service fees to get one  Late checkout was  and use of the exercise facilities was day  I was at a conference and they wanted gallon for coffee service which is nothing short of comical  That being said it is a ent enough place but the Hilton chain really needs to ide if this is a mid level hotel or an upper level one  Only then will it have a consistent product  
P => Very nice hotel   a couple of complaints Just got home from  nights at the Palmer House  It is a beautiful hotel and in a great location  We stayed in a  BR  BA unit   very nice size and accommodated the four of us very well  Regular rooms looked pretty small in comparison  Only things I had problems with were the plumbing noise when showers were being used next door and no coffeemaker in the room  Hope they do something to solve those  
P => Perfect city hotel Great old hotel in the center of shopping good resturantsnot far from the lake  Very good serviceI hope when I do priceline again I get this hotel  This hotel has charm  
P => Wonderful hotel for my journey to the Pitchfork Festival I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton to attend the Pitchfork Music Festival I stayed y     I booked through Priceline com very cheap and was pleased with the hotel Comments  I thought the location of the Palmer House in the Loop was perfect  The hotel takes up an entire block and there are three entrances each of which is right next to a subway or EL stop the blue red and all the loop trains  It was so easy to get around  The hotel is one block from Millennium Park where the Bean is and also about one block from The Art Institute of Chicago    The hotel is huge  It was packed with guests the entire trip    The room was clean stylish and comfortable  The queen sze bed was firm with nice bedding  The bathroom was immaculate and had a wonderful bath tub  The only strange thing was that the TV was on the dresser in the corner of the room but I only watched for about  minutes the entire trip   There is no free Internet wireless which was kind of disappointing  You could pay for one hour in the lobby about  or  per  hours in your room  But there is a  hour business center where you can print our your boarding pass for free   There is a Starbucks on the ground level  No coffee machines in the rooms  
P => Great location so nice hotel Great location near the Michigan Avenue Art Institute of Chicago and Grant Park  Confortable and very clean rooms  Staff so helpfull  High speed internet and fitness center expensive  
P => Amenities at the Palmer House I stayed at the Palmer House in ust of  for a Labor convention  I was impressed by the locations and excellent service so I ided to return for the th of y weekend this year   I checked in Friday early noon after paying an additional fee   I was there with my son and family total  in the room  We were all on the reservation Upon arrival in the room found only two bath towels one soap and one shampoo  It took multiple calls to housekeeping to get additional towels soap and shampoo  They gave us a total of three each  Problem was that that was it Stayed  nights and got no additional soap or shampoo nor towels  This is not an economy hotel  Complained to front desk and was told that all hotels are cutting back in the area  Stayed at the Sheridan just weeks earlier and got excellent service  Very disappointed  Will not return  Additionally peeling wall paper and paint  
P => Very disappointing and theres no internet or cell phone service My husband and I were in Chicago for the weekend and found this pretty cheap on Hotwire  Unfortunately the  room didnt include the  parking and the  internet  The lobby is gorgeous very old and ornate but the rooms were in desperate need of a cleaning and reorating  We were given the disabled room I guess because we checked in late and be that was all that was left so there was no real shower just a handheld sprayer  Even worse the metal bars in the shower were all rusted  The wallpaper was peeling off in several places the corners of the room were dirty and there was mildew all over the tub  We called down to the front desk to complain thinking they would move us to a cleaner room but they just offered to have someone come up and clean it  The bed was saggy in the middle so much so that we were rolling into each other all night The most frustrating part though was the lack of internet or phone  Neither of our cell phones got any reception in the room and to use the internet was day  That would have been annoying except the fact that it was as slow as dial up  We tried twice and spent about  minutes with tech support before giving up  To the hotels credit they did refund our money  Overall    the hotel is gorgeous in the common areas but lacking in the rooms  Its a great deal if you dont need parking internet or phone but all those extras add up and there are lots of better hotels in Chicago in that price range  
P => NIce old hotel overpriced services We had a nice stay recently at the Palmer House in Chicago  It is ent location by Park and other downtown attractions but you are a hike from the RushDivision area  There didnt seem to be a whole lot going on around the hotel after midnight Our room was clean but old and we would never pay the rack rate to stay here again  
P => Awesome Chicago Stay Just stayed in the Palmer House after getting an unbelievably low rate through Priceline  I was apprehensive because of a few negative reviews  Apparently these reviewers did not give consideration to the historic nature of the hotel  Yes the pipes did make a little noise the room was small and the views are not great  However there was no loose wallpaper the room was extremely clean the carpeting was nice the beds were comforable and the lobby was beautiful  The greatest asset is the hotels proximity to GrantMillenium Park and many other tourist attractions on one side and State Street shopping and public transit on the other side  Additionally there are restaurants and convenience stores on every corner  I would highly recommend the hotel for a couple looking at spending a lot of time walking around the city  On the down side if you want a contemporary generic hotel you would be better served elsewhere  Youll pay extra for the exercise facility and pool we did not use the internet we did not use and some other amenities  The room was too small for more than two people  We were lucky enough to have quite neighbors but we could hear a lot of noise when we walked down the hallway  Ignore these faults and enjoy your stay By the way the hotels inout parking valet is  per day  We left our car at the Millenium Park Garage for  for  days  Also both the Gray Line and Chicago Trolley stop outside  We used the Chicago Trolley and loved both guides  
P => Great location for what we paid  My husband and I spent a  day weekend with  nights at the Palmer House  We used Priceline and for a cost under   a night we coudlnt have found anything close to this hotel at that price  The hotel lobby truly is gorgeous in its character of Old Chicago  We requested a King bed which we got at check in  th floor  Very friendly front desk staff and concierge service  We DID get a small room  But it was fine for the short while we spent in it  No view as it just looked across the way into the next wing of rooms  Bathroom    when people say small I guess I didnt believe HOW small  The area in front of the sink is exactly X  We counted the tiles In order to close the door you have to literally slide between the toilet and tub in the  inch space between the two  So   if you need space or are a bit quotfluffyquot this wouldnt be the bathroom for you   think airplane size  We DID have plenty of hot water and good pressure in the showertub  No space to store toilitries but there is a large clothes closet as big as the bathroom with shelves and plenty of space for everything  Two out of the  drawers open in the tv stand for more storage  A desk and two nightstands  Thats it furniture wise  CLEAN room The bar in the lobby is fun to people watch  Wine     Beer     Not bad for a hotel  Try their kobe sliders    yum Went down to starbucks for morning coffee each day  The Corner Bakery is right next door for good lunch sandwichessalads sweet rolls  breakfast sandwiches etc too  Location is the highlight as everything is in walking distance  Parks river shopping restaurants  Took the city bus straight to Shedd from stop right outside hotel  Would we stay again Yes  For a longer stay might want to try the tower rooms where the rooms are larger  But then wed have to weigh the cost difference  
P => Great Surprise Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations  I had no idea it would be so large so nice and with so many amenities  I also didnt realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute  We were met at the door by the friendliest staff  Even with a long line at check in the entire process was about  minutes  We enjoyed the room with the up to date TV ent size bathroom and comfortable bed  Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take out lunch at the main restaurant  Paid night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago  We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale but we also paid over night there  
P => Expensive but historic If you want to see a grande dame of a hotel this is it  The rooms are reorated and small as expected in an older hotel however the grandeur of the lobby and space is not to be missed  Youll pay dearly for the privilege however but the location is phenomenal  
P => Some good things some puzzlingly bad I stayed at this hotel for two nights on business  This is a historic hotel which means many things  The lobby is very ornate almost gauche but unique and interesting  The concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgeable  I stayed in a queen room with a view of a brick wall and a crummy roof  Since I wasnt there for the view I didnt mind so much  And as I mentioned its a historic hotel  Therefore the bathroom was very small but adequate and the room was tiny  Two things about this hotel really bothered me  The toiletries in the bathroom  Now some might say quotwho caresquot But Hiltons always have the full range of toiletries  The Palmer House had only shampoo and conditioner and soap  No lotion or other things that are common in most hotels  Also one can usually request additional items at the desk  Not here  In fact the front desk clerks were a bit rude about it  Since I travel light those toiletry items were things I did not pack  The second weirdness was no free internet  I have a hard time believing that in the days of wi fi the Hilton would still be charging so much for internet access to its customers  Id probably stay elsewhere in Chicago in the future  
P => Felt like I was on my honeymoon all over again Lets see the check in process was great We were upgraded from a double to a King size room on the fifteenth floor free of charge  How about for an anniversary present The hotel is beautiful and very romantic  As others have stated the bathrooms are less than roomy  The location is perfect because it is centrally located by everything  My stay was during the y th weekend therefore the hotel was busy  In all honesty the staff were great and extremely friendly  We plan on returning next year for the Taste of Chicago again Just a friendly hint the rooms are small unless you request a queen or king size bed  
P => Great for vacation not so good for business travel  Beautiful opulent building with friendly staff and conveniently located to everything you would want to visit in Chicago  That said when I travel for business I need to get ready quickly usually early in the morning with a cup of coffee and a hot shower  No coffee maker in the room but an expensive Starbucks in the lobby  Tiny bathroom with low water pressure in the shower  Colleagues said they had no problem with water in the Executive Level rooms but I cant afford those rates  Internet access is available in the room for a hefty fee  WiFi is available in the public areas again for a hefty fee  So I would stay there again if I were just on vacation but not for business  
P => Enjoyed the Stay We stayed at the Palmer during the th of y weekend  The hotel was as advertised nice lobby but very TINY room and TINY bathroom expected in older hotels in downtown  We were traveling with a toddler so needed some room for her to move around  We paid for an upgrade to the executive floors floors  and  well worth it The executive floors have privateexpress elevators room key activation so we never had to wait for an elevator  Executive floors also offers free breakfast various juices milks bagels pastries yogurts fruits coffees and cereals snacks all day great hors d uvres in the evening with soft drinks alcohol available for purchase and free internet with printing  The room and bathroom were very comfortable  The service throughout our stay was very good  As stated in previous reviews the location of the hotel is also favorable  I would recommend a stay in the executive floors for the right price and not the regular rooms for parties of more than   
P => Beautiful Hotel with Great Location My wife and three year old dhter just stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for seven nights  We had a very nice sized room on the th floor  We bring an air mattress for my dhter and there was a ent amount of room for it  The hotel is about two blocks from Grant Park the Art Institute of Chicago and Millenium Park which is really nice  The Red Line of the El is also right outside the State Street exit  We did not have a car in Chicago so being in a central location was a key for us  I would recommend not bringing a car since the parking for the hotel is about a block away and it did not look convenient to park anywhere in the city We were very happy here and would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Stay during th of yTaste of Chicago Stayed   this hotel Fri Sun of y th wknd with fam  Had quotissuesquot the st night booked  rooms but they claimed they only had rsvp for and of course they were sold out so the girls stayed the st night amp the fellas went to my uncles  BR apt downtown God send for last minutenot so for sleeping comfort So much action in the quotswankyquot lobby area  seemed as if there were cocktail parties going on the entire time Went to the Taste on Sat we were there for about  hrs and ever hr the rain got worse so we left   then it stopped raining Visited all of our quotUSUAL STOPSquot Giordanos Pizza Als Italian Beef Carsons Ribs Garrett Popcorn Fannie Mae Chocolate Water Tower Place CHICAGO ST TIMERS  U MUST VISIT THESE LOCATIONS  Front Desk Mgr  Chanielle was THE BEST EVER she really took care of us in the end wish shed been working Fri Night 
P => Great with a few drawbacks Stayed for one night  Booked a trip through hotwire com and they were actually nice to us Had a room with one queen bed on a quite side of the building the El goes right next to the hotel  Lobby was gorgeous Self park is   Bathroom was TINY really tiny Had only  pillows when most hotel usually have  and only  bath towels had to ask the maid in the hall for more  The walls are a little thin as late at night and early in the morning we could hear the noise from the room next to us sounded like a group  Would stay again but definitely not at full price  
P => Its just not puppy love  Beside the fact that dogs are allowed and the yapping kept me up all night I can only say that everything else at the Palmer House is great  The room and the attitude of the employees was super  Management responded to my calls regarding the dog barking but apparently the guests were out most of the evening  Solution Dont visit Chicago on a holiday weekend  And find a hotel that doesnt allow dogs  
P => Upgrade to the Executive Level I stay at the Palmer House very often  I have gotten it for as little as  on Priceline  The last time I was there they offered me an uprgrade to the Executive Level for   It was great I recommend asking if they have that available  You get an express elevator that only stops at the two executive floors  On your floor there is complimentary beakfrast complimentary hors deuvres complimentary soft drinks hrs and a bartender with a full bar  Its a beautiful hotel but because it is so large it seems to be one of the more frequent hotels I get on Hotwire and Priceline  The only problem I have with the hotel is that it can sometimes take up to an hour to get your car from the valet if they are very busy  As long as you plan ahead with the that this hotel is great  
P => Big corner room wgreat views  If you stay just a short walk around the corner is a great pizza place called Excheckers  
P => So Beautiful and Outstanding Location This place is very lovely and comfortable  Staff is kind location outstanding  We stayed for  nights and we could walk to many places from here  The room service is wonderful and yummy 
P => Old World with the Upgrades I remember staying at the Palmer House about  years ago and thinking it was pretty run down  Not anymore  Very nicely orated and conveniently located in Downtown  Its a pleasure to walk around the town in the summertime   The rooms are quaint and clean and quiet I had the last room on the corridor  I liked that the windows actually opened  Suprisingly the bank of elevators accomodated our large group and I was never late  The food in the hotel was very good with many selections and the room service was more than prompt  The front desk staff was efficient and friendly My only complaint was the bed was hard and I couldnt sleep more than a few hours  Other than that The Palmer House was better than I expected  
P => For these parking charges you should sleep in your car When I called the hotel I was told that parking is included in the price of the room  Not so when I arrived with my car  I could have taken public transportation and saved my self  per day parking charge The only hotel in the USA that has no coffee maker in the room so that if you want coffee when you wake up you have to buy it at the Starbucks franchise in the hotel What an obvious rip off 
P => Magnificent Ambiance Great Room Ideally located just off Michigan Ave  I could walk to where I needed to go  The hotel is grand in every way with great or and ambiance  My room was well appointed clean and the beds comfortable  Excellent soundproofing done with the reations  I work in hotel management for a living so I looked for everything I look for when I when Im on the job  Kudos to two staff members the Iranian gentleman at the front desk who was very knowledgeable about the area and gave me great directions even at  in the morning and the valet supervisor during the st shift on   Good service  Overall I would recommend this hotel to others and I would definitely stay here again  
P => Got a great room    even with Hotwire I had booked my hotel stay with Hotwire and I was a little nervous after reading the reviews of others who had used Hotwire or Priceline  However we were given a lovely recently reated room  The room including the bathroom was done in a very nice Art o style  It was a bit small the room had one queen bed a king would have never fit in there  Whoever designed the room made great use of the available space  The only time the room size was an issue was getting ready in the morning  There wasnt enough space for my husband and I to be in the bathroom at the same time  
P => Small room but great style  I moved from the Doubletree same brand to the Hilton during a  week stay and the only thing I can say is that the Palmerhouse Hilton brand rooms were half the size of the Doubletree  However for my trip the Hilton was better located to where I was working which was great  The rooms had good style to them but I must say one thing that really bugged me was that there was no WIFI so I had to plug into the desk  At night I like to be able to sit in bed and do things on my laptop and the cord would not reach to the bed so I could only use the computer at the desk  OK but you just get used to having WIFI at most business hotels  And the cost was a bit much in my mind for internet  I usually expect it for free but up to   a day is a bit of a ripoff in my mind  The bathrooms were very stylish and the overall hotel is well styled especially the lobby  The concierge were very helpful with bags and restaurant advice  All in all good hotel and would stay again but would hope that management take these recommendations to heart as Im sure they are common complaints  
P => This rooms are not very good the lobby is nice The lobby of this hotel is historical and beautiful  Its not really a high class hotel though  The rooms are far from high class  The carpet is dingy and old looking  The room did not have a coffee maker  I dont think I have ever stayed in a hotel that had a coffee maker  This hotel does have a Starbucks as many hotels do of this type  The rooms are also small  There is little room between the beds and the tv and the bathrooms are small  You wouldnt be able to close the bathroom door if you were sitting on the toilet  You would have to get up so your knees would not hit the door  There was no room to put anything in the bathroom  The bathroom door had peeling paint  The lobby had a lot of people and the ceiling was beautiful  I booked this through hotwire at night   with taxes and fees for  nights  I asked for a room with two double beds and they said no such rooms were available  They asked if I wanted a rollaway bed for night and I lined  As with most hotels in Chicago parking is very expensive so if you drive in call some places around and you can get overnight parking at less than half the price of the hotel  The Millenium Park garage is nearby and is much cheaper  The room had virtually no view other than being able to see part of the Jersey Boys sign from a theater  
P => Disappointed with this Hilton Both my spouse and I are Hilton Golds and have stayed at many Hiltons but we were disappointed with our experience here  We stayed in  for a friends wedding but the service was abysmal and they took the phrase quotnickel and dimedquot to the extreme  We wanted to check in before  pm   a  charge  We asked for a room upgrade   another  charge EVEN IF you are a Hilton Platinum or Gold VIP  No coffee maker in the room  Would you like one   Forgot your toothbrush   When I pointed out that every Hilton we have stayed at in the past  years has offered these things with no charge they informed me that quotour policy changed quot The ambience It is an old hotel and while the historic aspect is nice what this means is that the rooms are quite small and there is a potentially a LONG maze like walk from the elevators to your room  The executive lounge which you CAN access with your room key if you are a Hilton VIP even if you are not on the concierge level was okay  Free coffee tea soft drinks  Continental breakfast pastries cereal yogurt fruit is served in the morning  They do have happy hour finger foods from  pm  Not the most elaborate spread but not the worst either  As I mentioned the service was the worst part of the hotel  I was told when they had checked out that the hotel has  rooms  Yes that is  rooms  No wonder NO ONE EVER ANSWERS the phone  Each time I called to the front desk I was on the line for literally  minutes with no answer  Once when someone finally answered I had been transferred to the Hilton by Ohare Airport WTF Not only that but when we checked out they had charged us  for making an outside phone call  The only problem was we both had cell phones and never used the phone to make an outside phone call It appears that they actually had the nerve to charge me for the call to the front desk that was somehow misdirected to the Ohare Hilton And you shouldnt be surprised that I had to argue with the front desk staff to have the charge removedBy the way my friend had booked a large suite complete with dining room table etc  and got no service either so it obviously makes no difference whether you pay a lot of money   they still seem as if they couldnt care lessWe love Hilton and remain loyal Gold VIPS but the Palmer House is definitely one to avoid  
P => Palmer House was a beautiful and friendly hotel  great location for the fun of Chicago I was on a getaway with my yr old dhter   Palmer House was a wonderful spot  We were walking distance to the theater and we enjoyed roller blading on Lakeshore   great restuarants around and close to the trainwould stay again in a heartbeat 
P => good value for location some minor drawbacks ask for what you want we were at the palmer house this weekend  we called ahead and asked for a quiet king room  check in was easy and we did indeed get a quiet king room  we paid  through hotwire a night which is a difficult price to find for a hotel downtown  yes the room was small ish and yes you could easily hear peoples conversation as they walked down the hall   although we couldnt hear people in the rooms next to us  the bed was comfortable  you really cant beat the location it is steps away from the El and the red line not to mention millenium park and the art institute  it is not a newly constructed hotel and that is part of its charm   it is a historic hotel  
P => Nickle and Diming to the extreme Let me start by saying that I did not have a choice but to stay here and that as a Hilton Silver member I had some expectation of a reasonably good reception  My  day business meeting was in the hotel and it would have been a hassle to stay elsewhere  Retrospectively I wish I had  Silver membership be damned First warning should have been enough  Upon checking in at  pm I was told that yes rooms were available but that the hotel policy was to charge  for check in before  pm  That was a new one for me and I do travel around the county about  months of the year  I politely lined even though I felt like by responding with a few choice words  While I was patiently waiting for the mns to elapse in the lobby I had to fend off  different bell boys who kindly offered to put my carry on in storage for a fee of course  Checking in at  pm I was informed that a king size bedroom was not available  Hmm I guess all the other guests either paid way more than I did or had a least a gold or platinum club level  Room was passably clean spacious enough view on a brick wall  No coffee maker  Even the seediest motel provide those nowadays  Gym was only accessible through the spa at a hefty fee  Pool was closed although it was already warm enough but I suspect access would have been for a fee  Self park was  a day  valet  Good job I did not bring a car Of course wireless internet or LAN for a fee  If you request directions to the business center you will be directed to the one on the street level which is very pricey  No one will tell you about the self serve business center on the th floor which although far from free will allow you to save around   on what you want to do  Phone charges were outrageous  Thank god for cell phones but usually you are allowed to call local numbers or  numbers for free at least for a short period of time  Not here   connection fee then c a minute after  mns Also strangely enough the hotel Starbucks was about   more expensive than the one down the streetLocation is NOT great by the way hotel is pretty far from everything except for the Bank of America theater  It is not even on North Michigan Avenue  If you can save yourself the aggravation and stay somewhere else eg at the Embassy Suites a few blocks down the road and enjoy a much better location and many more free amenities and perks  Vote with your feet and those hotels will stop treating us like cash cows  
P => Couldnt have been better Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend  The staff was wonderful room was beautiful and location great  You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel  Very close to museums and restaurants  I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago  
P => A very pleasant stay I spent  nights at the Palmer House Hilton as part of a conference  After reading some of the reviews I was uncertain what to expect of my stay  I was pleasantly surprised My room was on the th floor on the side near the train  It was not a factor as I did not hear it after going to sleep nor were any of my neighbors noisy The rooms are cozy with excellent beds The concierge was most helpful as were the front desk staff when I had issues with the business center  The restaurant is very good and the staff were pleasant and friendly  The location is perfect for the Art Institute of Chicago and Symphony Hall and is only  blocks from Macysshall Field  The train for OHare is a couple of blocks away  Overall if I were to be in Chicago I would stay here  
P => Beautiful old quirky hotel in wonderful location I attended a conference at the hotel and stayed there for  nights  Check in and out were easy the lobby is spectacular and the meeting facilities offer a lot of flexibility  Service was good except it took  minutes after arrival before the bellman brought me the correct bags  The location offers easy access to Grant Park the Art Institute as well as other downtown locations  The Starbucks in the lower lobby almost made up for the lack of a coffee maker in the room  No wi fi in rooms but very high speed internet available for a price with their USB connection  Nice walk in closet  The bathroom was uncomfortable    no counter space 
P => What an Improvement We last stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in tember   Then we experienced offhand treatment from most of the staff we encountered had a tiny room not much bigger than a closet and a view of absolutely nothing  We did not feel welcome  Also the area seemed to be going down hill and last straw shall Fields the landk Chicago department store was about to be taken over by Macys This time Wow what a difference  It was a busy weekend being Memorial Day on the Monday but we checked in rapidly thanks to Hhonors Priority line got an upgraded room on the quotExecutive Floorquot not many executives in evidence though and had a view sort of  The room made up for it  It was splendid Throughout our stay every single member of staff we encountered were friendly and helpful  And the area is on the up too  And Macys has preserved some of the original elements of shall Fields including the wonderful top floor restaurant  Millennium Park and the The Arts Institute are nearby and if you must quotMiracle Milequot is a short walk or El ride away We really enjoyed our time here  Well done Palmer House Hilton  
P => A lovely hotel in the best location We really loved Palmer House Hilton  It has a long interesting history and could not be in a better location  Stay in the Loop 
P => Nice period hotel Very well furnished with a nice old world charm while offering all the features and amenities you would expect from a modern hotel Rooms are reasonably priced but the pricing for all extras including room service and laundry are outrageously high Well located just a short walk from the southern end of the Golden Mile Overall a good bet if all you are looking for is a pleasant place to sleep and expect to be out of the hotel all day  
P => Would definitely stay here again especially at the price  Like a number of people we reserved the Palmer House via Priceline  I cannot believe a place this nice can be had in a town the size of Chicago for that price The room was clean and comfortable and reasonably large which is a basic need of all hotels and it fulfilled them wonderfully  The location close to the park is excellent and the red line subway to Wrigley is right out your door  It could be a little closer to the Magnificent Mile area but that would be nit picking  Great for a quick weekend in Chicago  
P => Great space great location great experience Stayed for  nights over the weekend with my husband  yr  old son and mother in law  I have stayed here previously for business trips and was not concerned about the rooms being small or noisy since it was generally just one night  We booked thru Priceline for  plus taxnight   great rate  When we checked in I specifically asked for a quieter room away from the elevators etc  and possibly for a room that was a bit larger than the usual room with  doubles  We were accomodated with a room that had  bathrooms and  double beds  Appears to have been  arate rooms at one point and was perfect for our little group plenty of space Love that there is a Starbucks on the lower level a Corner Bakery steps from the front door Millenium Park and Michigan Avenue a block away the El steps from the door   very convenient  We didnt mind the pool  Sure its smaller but its a hotel what are people expecting Olympic sized proportions Our son had a great time in it  After our son was in bed and Grandma setted in my husband and I enjoyed a nightcap in the gorgeous lobby area relaxing and people watching  Great space great location great experience  
P => Very delightful stay My family and I spouse and  month old son stayed here just this past weekend     The doormen where very attentive and ready for anything  The room was nice a little small but I loved the d cor it was very contemporary  A lot of amenities  I had a crib order to the room  The bed and pillows made me feel like I should have been in a Sealy Posturepedic commercial  The tub was very deep  And overall the hotel was very extravagant  We also had some food delivered from TGIF Fridays but it was through a company called CEO Deliveries and they even stopped and picked up a  liter of pop from a store for a fee of course but wasn t too bad  I enjoyed the stay and would like to visit again 
P => Spacious but Busy My wife and  sons spent a weeks vacation in Chicago  We booked a room thru one of the internet discount websites and got a wonderful and affordable room at this conveniently located hotel  It is a large and busy hotel think conventions but because it was built at a time when hotels paid attention to detail the Palmer House retains a sense of elegance particularly in the public spaces that is lacking in many modern hotels  It is a busy hotel and that was fine for a family with teens but  not be so for couples who are seeking a relaxing environment  And even though it has an indoor pool nice in ruary the chlorine odor in the air kept us from using it much  All in all  A nice and conveniently located hotel for families  
P => Like an impressionist painting nice from afar but not so great up close We had the opportunity to stay five nights at the Palmer House over Memorial Day and it was a very uneven experience  I had a special rate for an event and it seemed like they made sure I knew that because I got that special rate I was not going to get the same experience that a guest paying full price would pay  This was particularly concerning to me because I m a Hilton Honors member and I always go out of my way to stay at Hilton properties so it seemed a little short sighted in my opinion for them to jeopardize that long term relationship by making sure I knew I was in the hotel equivalent of steerage  Staff Overall the staff was nice and helpful  People were friendly but the check in was odd  They had a sign for a Hilton Honors check in but when I asked they said they didn t have it and to just wait on line  Then the guy seemed to take forever to find a room  He didn t offer the normal perks I would get with my membership so I had to ask for those which is just out of character compared with any other property I ve stayed at Facilities It s an old hotel but with a very elegant lobby  It s very beautiful so your expectation when you walk in is that this is a wonderful place  And if you are lucky enough to get a reated room it is  However the room I had was on the th floor and it was definitely the smallest room I ve ever had in the US  There have been a couple of rooms in Europe that were smaller but this was tiny  And other people who were staying in the hotel with the same rate had nice rooms some with two bathrooms so that was disappointing Additionally for an old hotel you d think the walls would be thicker  I could hear my neighbor s television through the wall and in the bathroom you could clearly hear conversations from the next room through the vent near the ceiling  Additionally when the next room turned on the shower it made a high pitched hissingsqueaking sound that made conversation impossible  It was really really loud That said the room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was a good size  The elevators were a little slow but everything was nice and not worn down or dirty We had access to the executive floor that had a continental breakfast in the morning  The room with the food and coffee is poorly laid out so even with only a few people there it gets congested quickly  The PC they have for guest use on the exec floor is also incredibly slow  It took  minutes just to print out a boarding pass because each page took a long time to load  This led to other guests thinking you were hogging the computer when in reality you were just doing one thing  Highlights The lobby was beautiful and a nice place for a drink  The staff especially the cleaning personnel and the doormen were nice  The location is great  You re close to the old shall Field s now Macy s close to transit Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park are just a block away Areas for improvement The elevators were sometimes very slow and several times I saw people taking elevators up to the top floor to go back down because they could not get an elevator going down The way the hotel nickels and dimes you makes you feel like you re at a cheap motel where you have to pay for everything that isn t nailed down  The health club is an extra day  if you re an Honors Gold member and internet access in the room is priced from  day  Valet parking was day which is high but probably not too different from other downtown hotels  Overall impression This hotel left me with mixed impressions  The lobby leads you to believe you re going to be staying in a luxurious historic hotel but if you get a non reated room you might think you re in a gulag instead  And then when the hotel tacks on fees for the gym and internet you might as well pay a full rate somewhere else and get the services included rather than have them added on a la carte  That just seems cheap to me especially the way this hotel is positioned  If it was a Motel  yeah I understand they ll charge for extras but it s unseemly in a nicer hotel I would not stay here again  Next time I m in Chicago will probably stay at the Hilton  I am a loyal Hilton guy but I do not think the Palmer House adds any value to the brand  In fact it diminishes it in my opinion and makes me reconsidering always staying at Hilton properties  I shared my feelings with the customer service manager this was right after I realized that a large group of teenagers was moving into the hotel the night before I was going to leave and about  of them were staying on my floor and he did offer to move me to a better room and comp a night  That was nice and I appreciated it but if they had a nicer room to offer then they should have done that to begin with rather than stick me with a smaller room and hope I wouldn t complain  Reactive customer service is never as good as proactive customer service Nearby transportation Very close to all major subway lines on Wabash Avenue or State Street  Stops are right outside the hotel  Plenty of cabs available  
P => Nicely appointed hotel     Difficult to rest I was impressed upon arrival  The hotel is very grand and the rooms are appointed very nicely  However I had a very difficult time getting any real sleep here for two reasons     My bed was within inches of my rooms door which is turn was right next to two other room doors  One of my neighbors came and went all night long with the doors slamming just a foot or so from my head waking me each and every time   My room was located above a train station and the trains ran all night long One final complaint    the room service menu was very limited although the food was delivered quickly Ill be looking elsewhere for my next stay  
P => Great room hotel and location Just back from  nights with friends and we all cant say enough good things about PHHs rooms location and proximity to great things in Chicago Three of us total in  rooms with  double beds    one had a bigger bathroom the other a bigger bedroom    both were very generously sized  Great bed and bedding nice quirky furnishings irritating clock radio with time that is an hour off but cant be adjusted and no coffee maker but a Starbucks on street level and a cheap and cheerful breakfast place on the corner  In the afternoonevening the lobby is a gorgeous place for a drink and people watching  If you are from a small quiet town and are staying at the PHH or any other hotel in the area called the Loop which puts you near everything and should be your goal youll hear the elevated train honking cabs and street action late into the night  It adds to the character of the city    just bring earplugs and youll sleep fine after a busy day PHH is a block or two from the Art Institute and Millenium Parks sculptures a few more blocks from the river and its Chicago Architecture Foundation boat tour highly recommended with an easy walk to Miracle Mile shopping Buddy Guys Legends a convenient spot for Chicago blues with low cover charge and  pints etc  The hotel is located in the middle of some of Americas best early skyscrapers    search for and download the Loop audio tours on Landks including PHH and Millennium Park to really appreciate your location and surroundings  I booked through an opaque bidding site but was pleased enough that I would consider full price 
P => Great location and good historic hotel Not sure why everyone seems to bash this hotel in reviews  Great location and nice rooms  Internet is extra parking is high but this is a big city  If you want a brand new room stay at a brand new hotel  The rooms have been remodled and have some historic touches  I think the expectation is set to high with some reviewing this  The price and location are great  Right off the orange line El from midway with only one stop change at Roosevelt  Close to the park trains cab rides    this is where I will return rather than the north loop that is more crowded it seems  
P => Good value but         Stayed here recently for  nights  The location is good steps from Michigan Ave  the common areas are historic and beautiful and the staff is pleasant and courteous  As expected in a hotel of this vintage my room was small though nicely furnished and the bathroom tiny  My window looked out at a tenement about  feet away  My major complaint was the paper thin walls the guests in the room next to mine had an extended conversation around  AM one night and although I dont think they were speaking particularly loudly it sounded as though they were in my room  Id stay here again for the terrific rate I paid through Hotwire but certainly wouldnt pay rack  
P => Old World Charm The Palmer House is in a great central location   within easy walking distance to theater and parks  Millinneum Park just  blocks Beautiful hotel friendly staff quiet rooms 
P => Nice historic hotel with a great location Everything went smoothly for my long weekend stay at The Palmer House  Although we waited in line for  minutes to check in big conference in town checking in was a breeze and the front desk staff was friendly  Stayed in a big room on the th floor near the end of the hallway  Street traffic noise was still fairly loud even on the th floor  The location is great   blocks from Millennium Park a block from the train station lots of eatingshopping options  
P => Location adds value of this pricey place  This is a great hotel but a bit pricey for what you get out of the hotel itself  Rooms were only so so beds very comfortable there was not coffee in the room which meant we had to leave the room for coffee at Starbucks or McDonalds It is located however in the middle of downtown within walking distance of most downtown events landks and restaurants  Many fast food and drugstores within blocks  Hotel located one block from Michigan Avenue and Millinium Park which is next to Grant Park  I actually walked to the House of Blues up on Dearborn via Michigan Avenue to meet colleagues  The El train also stops a couple blocks away and will take you anywhere  You can also catch the City Tour bus from this hotel  If you do stay at this hotel take a stroll down the street to the beautiful Millinium park and down to see the Buckingham fountain and Lake Michigan  Journey north cross the Chicago river and circle back on foot  Fun time with plenty to see Valet parking at this hotel is  per night  You can also park down the street at the municipal garage for  per night  The valet and luggage folks werent real friendly but did their job just the same  
P => We were sceptacle after reading all the bad reviews but were pleasantly surprised My wife and I booked through Howire a few days before our  day trip to Chicago  We had never been there before and did not know where to stay so we thought wed try Hotwire  We ended up getting a great deal on a  star hotel for  night As soon as we found out that we booked the Palmer House we started reading reviews and were expecting the worst I called the hotel right away to request a king size bed and crossed my fingers  We ended up arriving a couple of hours early so we called ahead to ask if we could check in early  They said there was a  early check in fee  We got our king size bed for no extra charge and we were not charged the  early check in fee which was also a pleasant surprise The location of the Palmer House is fantastic  Millenium park and the waterfront are pretty much at your doorstep and if you dont mind walking everywhere like we did you can have a great time at Navy Pier the museums planetarium shedd aquarium the magnificent mile sears tower hancock tower and much much more Chicago is the most beautiful city we have ever visited and the Palmer House was no exception  Our room had a king size bed a desk chair and a beautiful bathroom  We loved it  We would do it again in a heartbeat  The staff were excellent and the hotel is beautiful  Dont nit pick and enjoy your stayThe only thing we would say negative about the hotel is the price of food  One word     pricey But thats what you pay at a world class hotel in a world class city Parking was pricey too but it is what it is  Parking is a scare commodity in the downtown so you pay for it but for the hotwire price we got we couldnt care less 
P => Back to the windy City in ch  Palmer house is a huge hotelThe place is like a rabbit warren Rooms are large and have more cushions on the bed than any hotel in the worldThe room price agreed on the net was  per night I met a colleague at the same meeting who was charged  for the same room I discussed with front desk and they agreed to match the rates 
P => Great experience if you have good price   service excellent but extras pricey I stayed with a friend for about five nights having secured a great deal a few nights before our stay on hotwire com for night  I read the reviews online and was prepared for the pricey extras   the extra charge for internet use gym use charge for early check in etc that people complain about   and thus avoided them  The service was great   we called on two occassions to get our shower drain fixed because it was flooding and our security box fixed because it wouldnt open and on both occassions the matter was dealt with promptly  The only complaint I would have is that the bathroom is small and difficult to use but thats about it  I tried the restaurant downstairs on my last night and although it was expensive I was able to find a reasonable dish to dine on my own  Neighbors can get noisy if people are intentionally making noise babies adults upstairs or downstairs but thats probably an issue one runs into at any hotel    and would suggest you ask for a quiet room if concerned  I think this hotel is for business professionals as well as young couples on a romantic getaway  
P => Nice lobby food and people  Rooms were a big turnoff  I went to the Palmer House with my sales team for a convention in Chicago  Upon arriving in the lobby the hotel seemed impressive and grand  The Lockwood in the lobby was great the night I arrived and full of people wanting to  see and be seen   Check in was a little slow and there is a special line for Hilton Honors members  I am a member but since there was no one in the main line I thought I would just go there this was a mistake  As people would walk up to the other line they would take them first I ended up getting up to the front after four people walked up to the other line  While I was there I heard other people very annoyed at this also The rooms are clean and nice enough but old and a little creepy  The hotel is huge and the halls are serpentine  Everyone I was there with went the wrong way at least once trying to find their rooms  Also  each us had an issue of having thin walls or a vent that you could hear clearly what was going on in other rooms  The bed was very comfortable though and the maid service was great I never made it into Potters bar as they were closed every time I tried to go in for a drink  On Friday night at  they were already closed We did have a meeting at the hotel which was nice and all the food I had while there was very good  this included two meals at Lockwood The big pro was the people almost everyone I spoke with at the hotel was very helpful from catering staff the Lockwood Staff and the street level bellmen and security  The other wow factor is the lobby which is historic and worth seeing  The last pro was the executive level  This was well worth it if you are there on business the breakfast was nice and the afternoon appetizers were fantastic  The con is that it is a very old hotel and the rooms don t do enough to conceal this  If I go back I might stop in for a drink in the lobby but I would much rather stay in a hotel with nice rooms  
P => Loved the Updates It has been a couple of years since I stayed here and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire  I paid only  and stayed a Saturday night  I was very impressed with the reorating done to the hotel  The lobby has always been great but the rooms were a little shabby in the past  Not any more as the hotel has been reorated in the last few years  The location is still amazing and with the Berghoff open again there is a great restaurant within walking distance  
P => Great Hotel   if you get a good price We stayed at the Palmer House for  nights in late il  Got a great price through Hotwire  plus tax so I think that sort of sums up the review  If you can get a good deal then the hotel is fantastic for the price  I can see the poor reviews if you paid  for a night but at our price we cant complain about anything We had called the hotel in advance and asked for extra pillows and a king sized bed and both were happily accomodated  At the desk we asked for a quiet floor and end up on the st floor and a corner room  While Im sure based on other reviews that some rooms are tiny ours was huge because it was a corner with  nice chairs  Old school TV but who cares  The bathroom was not small either although Im sure in the smaller rooms it could be small  No water problems or anything  Even the elevator was quick but the hotel was quiet for the st  nights of our stay  We also checked in at pm before the pm check in time and we given a room right away without asking and without an extra charge  Our hotel room seemed updated so it might have been recently reated  You might want to ask for a reated room  Even on the st floor you could hear the trains outside but it was muted enough it never was an issue Similar to other complaints it is really inexcusable for a   hotel to not have a coffee maker in the room  Come on But still thats pretty minor  There are lots of cheap breakfast places in the same block as the hotel anyway so it was never a big deal The hotels location was great  Right on the Orange Line from Midway airport where we flew too right by the Bank of America Theatre we saw the Jersey Bosys right at Millenium Park and the art institute and right on the Red line subway to get to the north end of downtown for shopping if you are tired of the nice walk The lobby is beautiful but we didnt hang out in there due to the cost for drinks  We had reservations for other restaurants in town for dinner so didnt eat at the Palmer at all  Also didnt check out the pool forgot our bathing suits at all Overall while Im sure there are better hotels at the price we paid for the quality we got it was fantastic  If I was paying much more I might have thought about other hotels but if you can get a   for under a  in Chicago you cant complain about the small things  
P => Great location beautiful old building interior  We were just traveling through Chicago and only needed a place for the night  Got a great price from Priceline   Close to Millennium Park and the rest of downtown  The room was moderate sized with  beds  The beds were very comfortable  Quiet for an older hotel  The lobby has a nice bar but the main attraction is the very high ceiling with wonderful painting and sculptures  A great place to stumble back into at night  We like the Flemish House a BampB to stay at but they require more than  night  This is very nice for the price  Front desk was a little understaffed but we got checked in after about  minutes  There are a number of steps you need to walk up in order to check in  Not that easy with heavy suitcases  
P => Maid service went MIA tiny room left uncleaned for  days My boyfriend and I stayed at the Palmer House for two nights for a friends wedding  The room was booked as part of a block of at least   rooms especially for the wedding party  While were able to check in properly we learned that several people had problems with check in or even getting a room Our room th floor was extremely small about x with a x bathroom to begin with  There is no mini bar  fridge in the room by the way  The room was clean when we arrived but the next day we waited all day for the maid service to come through and she finally showed up around PM  I asked if she could come back at PM and she said it was fine  But after we returned from an evening out the room remained completely untouched  This also happened to another friends room on the st floor and we wondered if it was a shared quotperkquot of being covered under the wedding reservation block  Needless to say it was very irritating  We stayed at the Hyatt Regency the night before and I would absolutely recommend going there instead  
P => Great hotel fab spot super service We were a bit nervous about staying here having read so many negative reviews  We could not be more happy that we did stay here  The hotel which is in an amazing location right off millenium park close to metro stops shopping and restaurants is a top class joint  The lobby is spectacular and what you dont get from the photos is a sense of how relaxing this place is  The buzz of the lobby with the flow of people and the background music slightly soft jazzchill out give this place a fantastic atmosphere  Just sitting in the lobby bar watching it all go by is a treat  Its almost like the place to be seen  The service was excellent at every turn check in bar and restaurant and cleaning staff  Everyone was extremely polite and friendly  A smile goes a long way  The concierge was outstanding  Aside from giving us great restaurant and logistics advice they booked almost all of our restaurants in the evenings  Extremely thorough service The bathrooms are a little small big deal How long does anyone need to spend in the bathroom when in a hotel anyway The pool in the leisure centre was tiny which is my only real criticism and we probably would have made better use of that area had it been bigger  It seemed crowded as a result any time we walked by In short the hotel is fantastic  Do not hesitate to stay here  I had called in advance to arrange flowers for my wife who was celebrating her birthday during our stay  Everything went like clock work  I would definitely not be afraid to stay here again and hope to in the near future  Go enjoy and dont believe everything negative you read on TA  
P => Nice hotel that gouges guests This is a nice buidling with a great lobby  The rooms are fine but reflect they were built in a different era which has both good and bad effects  However the reason for the poor rating is the fact that the hotel gouges its guests and sorry but there is no other way to put it  I travel often for both business and leisure and have gotten used to the piling on of fees resort fees internet fees gym fees etc     But this place takes it to a new level  I arrived at noon  Normal check in time is  pm  As I typically do I asked if I there was an available room I could check into  They said there was but that because it was prior to  pm there would be a  quotearly check inquot fee  Ive never heard of such a fee and it doesnt make sense  If a room in the category I paid for is available whenever I check in they ought to let me have it without requiring a fee  I used the gym ent but not equal to a full gym and was surprised to be hit with an  fee  That is the highest Ive had to pay  Not only is there no free internet but the fee they charge is the highest Ive ever seen  I do not recommend this hotel  Hilton ought to know better than to gouge guests like this  
P => Tiny rooms and extra charges for EVERYTHING I spent two nights at the Palmer House on business and was VERY disappointed  This is one of the most famous hotels in Chicago but it was not a great stay  The lobby is gorgeous and the restaurants are nice but here were my concerns  No coffee in the rooms   if you want a coffee pot in your room its day   Use of the fitness center is day   NO countertop space in the bathroom   very inconvenient   Bathroom is TINY   you could use the potty soak your feet and wash your hands all at the same time   Not clean   my towels had stains and there were personal quothairsquot in my bathtub   BEFORE I had used it  Yuck   Tiny dim window   the rooms are very dark   Very thin walls  The woman next door was just talking on her phone and I could hear every word      Noisy heatingair conditioning   banging and clanking etc every time it came on and off   High speed internet   dayMy company only paid night as a conference rate but if it were my own money I would have been VERY irritated  
P => A classic hotel beautifully refurbished with the nicest staff in a great location  The Palmer House was recently reated and the public rooms gleam  They reflect the luxury of turn of the century Chicago and are historic enough to be the subject of a local architecture tour  At least half of the guest rooms have been completely reated I stayed in one of these  The bed was very comfortable  The room itself was large well lit and well appointed  Two of the old very small rooms had been combined into one spacious double  Im sure other guests have had different experiences even recently as the rooms vary quite a bit in size layout and location and some have not been completely reated  I found that if you ask for what you want and talk with the reservationfront desk people they are accomodating and if the first room doesnt fit your needs theyll try to find one that does  Do be aware though that most rooms either look into inner courtyards or out onto busy streets  This is not the hotel for great views from most rooms  All of the staff was very friendly and helpful Ive never been warmly greeted and smiled at by so many  I love the location around the corner from Symphony Hall and the Art Institute near the theaters Millenium Park and shall Fields now sadly a Macys and the rest of State Street shopping  Many options for food both elegant and quick including takeout are available within a few blocks  I stayed at a convention rate so dont know how good the rates are in general  
P => A Get Away This hotel is beautiful and has everything you could need  However dont ask for a wake up call and expect to get it  
P => A beautiful hotel with a stunning lobby and great location We booked this hotel on Priceline and I was apprehensive after I read the reviews on Trip Adviser which were not terribly positive  However we were very impressed with the hotel from the moment we stepped into the lobby   which is stunning  Often the public areas are let down by the bedrooms but not in this case  Our rooms were very tastefully orated   miles away from the dreadful corporate theme  Check in was ultra efficient and quick  The hotel has had some recent refurbishment which has been done sympathtically to retain the grandeur of days before  The location could not have been better for our sightseeing needs and I highly reccommend a nightcap sitting in one of the upper salons  All in all a great hotel which enhanced our trip to our favourite US city  
P => Good location nice hotel This hotel was in a very good location just a few blocks from Buckingham fountain and Michigan Avenue  We were able to walk to many of the sites we visited which was nice  A public bus stop is also a block away and the buses are convenient for visiting the museum campus or its about a half hour walk  The lobby of the Palmer House is beautiful  We were originally given a room near the elevators which was a bit noisy so we switched to a different room after one night  We thought the hotel rooms were a bit small for a  star hotel but are nice overall  The only issue in the new room was that the toilet squealed for a minute after it was flushed but there was no elevator noise and almost no street noise  We booked on Hotwire so were very satisfied with the value for the price  
P => This is the place to stay when you visit Chicago I took my sweetheart to Chicago for his birthday to live it up and catch a couple plays  The Palmer House was absolutely perfect in every way    classy vintage centrally located to the playhouses steakhouses clubs museums and shopping This is the way Chicago is meant to be experienced You gotta have a cocktail at their bar in the lobby   they make terrific drinks   and pour generous glasses of wine we had cosmos   they were a  And you can take in the timeless architecture and stunning ceiling of this fabulous hotel It was his birthday so I booked a room on the concierge level for just an addtl night  You got breakfast drinkscookies all day and appetizers alcoholic beverages are not included   but it was nice  Frankly the cookies and brownies were pretty bad   but it prevented me from going bananas with themGood news The Palmer Hilton will pay for your parking in the structure across the street from the doormen    save yourself night and selfpark  I didnt know this and let the doorman park my car   the manager graciously reimbursed me when I told him I would have self parked had I been told it was comped  At first we were told it was night to park across the street  That was confusing   but in the end worked out in the guests favor Im a big Kimpton fan    but the Palmer House Hilton won my heart   and my future business  Oh   and be sure to dine at the Rosebud Prime Rib place near the Jersey Boys theater  The food and service is out of this world  Just   blocks away  
P => Old world service with a modern flair  Loved it I booked this hotel for  on Hotwire with mid level expectations for one night  Totally blown away  Arrived on a Sunday night  Gave car to valet night  Lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music  Check in was smooth and easy  I asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to rd party bookings  Upgrade to suite was available at a cost  I passed since only  night stay  I asked for a nice quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine  Received room    Room was huge with  beds  Felt like  square feet  Newly reated last year  Bell hop told me some rooms are very small so I totally lucked out Service from start to finish was top notch  Everyone had a smile on their face  Always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome  Ordered room service at  PM  Arrived in  hour  food was so so  Had pancakes in Lockwood for breakfast  Very good food and very good service  Strong coffee  Hotel is right on State Street shopping  FYI   Rooms on floors  and below were reated last year  Rest were done  years ago  For the price it was a great bargain Only complaint is bathroom is small  
P => Upscale Hotel in Millenium Park Area I travel frequently enough and stay at a wide gamut of hotels to compare the pros and cons of upscale vs budget  Chicago can be a hit and miss town when it comes to reasonably priced hotels  There is no doubt the city offers great  and  star properties   the question is at what cost For whatever reason the Palmer House   now owned by Hilton seems to be a hotel that will offer just that blend of luxury and value at certain times in the year  I gave it an average in terms of value because when prices go up this hotels room rates go right up with them  It is located just off the Monroe Red Line the quotLquot so you can easily take the quotLquot from Midway or OHare  I am sure some of you shudder at the thought of staying at a hotel like the Palmer House and riding or Dalys public transit in  Personally Ive done taxis shuttles and the L is the cheapest and I never had an incident using it  Doormen at the Hotel open the door promptly and greet you as you enter the Palmer House  The first thing you  notice is all the steps in this building as you enter  If you have knee problems or just dislike stairs this is not going to be a fun hotel for you  The check in counter is up quite a few stairs and it is a bit of a walk to go find the elevator to get up there  Also at nighttime   they close certain outside doors for entry back into the hotel   so before your taxi or ride drops you off   make sure you are at the right entrance and street or you will have a brisk walk around the building  In ember I learned this the hard way and I was pretty chilled by the time I reached the main entrance  Check In   I arrived a bit early    mins prior to check in and the gentleman was polite but firm that if I checked in early there would be an early check in fee  I just waited out in the lobby which is a fine elegant lobby that you can comfortably sit and wait in  Elevators are prompt and well lit   good or and clean interiors  I was in a standard room that was a bit smaller than the average hotel but it was well done  Attractive wall paper and framed art hung in the room   nice plump pillows and a very comfortable bed with the custoy flat screen TV  Remote worked fine and the carpet in the room was new as well  Bathroom was a bit cramped   although nice and bright and clean  For a business traveler   it seemed to suffice   i would think for a family or even two people traveling this  be a potential issue Overall   The Palmer House   a great place to stay for business travelers   if you happen upon it during a slower season youll be treated to a great hotel for a fantastic rate  
P => Rats  My wife and I left in a hurry last night and stayed somewhere nicer down the street  We were here for a total of  nights and saw  rats two outside the building and one inside  Absolutely disgusting I know a large metro area like Chicago has its problems but to see a rat inside the building is inexcusable We saw the rat on the third floor as we were taking our morning walk  Then later on that night as we left for dinner we saw two more while waiting   minutes for our cab  I spoke to the front desk and they informed me that they have had a rat problem for awhile that makes me feel better  Avoid this hotel like the plague which you just might get if a rat bites you 
P => A Chicago treasure thats now a convention hotel This is a convention hotel  Lots of conventions are held in Chicago and this hotel is set up to serve them  The staff is professional and efficient  The hotel itself is beautiful  Even if you dont stay here come and take a look at the lobby its lovely  The rooms are small for most people that is if you dont book a suite  No real views to speak of but this hotel best serves people who dont plan to be in the room for long  The hotel restaurant Lockwood was very good and the lobby is great for people watching while youre enjoying afternoon tea or drinks  On a personal note we stayed here for our anniversary as we had our wedding reception here  years ago  We will always have good memories of this hotel and have stayed here on past anniversaries  However this might be our last stay  The staff barely acknowledged our anniversary and the restaurant mention of it was less then what we have received at other Chicago hotels  The Chicago restaurant MK is a great place to enjoy a special meal with a loved one and the hotel Peninsula is wonderful at making you feel special I wish that I could have a better report however if you go for a convention youll be fine   
P => Just Trust Me and Dont Go  Okay this hotel has dropped BIG time  I went  years ago for a birthday weekend and was blowed away by the beautiful ceiling and shopping area available in the hotel  Sure the view from the rooms remind you of Shawshank Redemption but the hotel was still great  Fast Forward to Valentines Weekend  I couldnt wait to get back especially with the reations being touted on the hotel website  We stayed in the Executive Level  Save your money   New bedding in the room that was the extent of the reation  I questioned the concierge why the in room hotel information book listed things we didnt have and was informed that quotyes the books were inaccurate and they heard that alotquot  There is no coffee pot in the rooms  None of the rooms have coffee pots  The bathrooms are Very small if you leave the door open you will have even less room so close the door you get about  more inches  There is only room for  steps to the bowl and  steps to get back out  The amenities are Motel  brand and they are very stingy  You will get  very small bottle of no name shampoo and  of everything else   washclothes and  towels  If you forget your toothbrush that will be   The drinks in the executive level are iced to inch of there life and then a splash of liguor is provided for about the amount of your kids college tution  The pool is worse than a City pool that has been deserted  It looks like someone just cut a small hole in the floor and filled it with water  It has the appearance of your high school pool that has been neglected  The hot tub had floating skin  They do have a beautiful gym and a brand new spa But the spa services are VERY overpriced  You can not get any masssage services for less than   We also discovered on the last morning all the fresh towels were dirty and stained and were only folded nicely  I could go on and on but I wont  Just dont go  
P => BEAUTIFUL hotel in a great location  Beautiful and clean hotel and tastefully furnished  Located in a wonderful area and outstanding hotel staff  SMcClure EF Foundation 
P => No in room Coffee Come on The hotel is a beautiful historic property with lots of quirky aspects some good some not  Room was fine  Good location  Nice meeting space   if a little dated  Had  bathrooms for one person   which was fun  Biggest complaint No coffee pot in the room Please who doesnt have in room coffee anymore  Its a ision maker for me  Staff was nice   had to move rooms and they were very accommodating  
P => Many Hassles This is a great elegant building but I found that despite the charm there were many inconveniences  First the rooms are small which I found typical of New York style rooms and it was hard to find any room for bathroom accessories  For check in you have to ascend a flight of stairs and there was a long line unless you were a Hilton Honors member  There was a certain level of arrogance among the staff we encountered check in bar valet luggage check possibly due to the popularity of the hotel  The common areas always seemed to be very crowded  There was an  fee for the gym and the spa was prohibitively expensive The room had modern furniture and bathrooms and was kept very clean  We did see room service items in the hallway the entire weekend however For those not familiar with Chicago it is right downtown and close to all the CTA lines and major Chicago attractions as well as shopping We were not disappointed given that we paid a cheap Hotwire rate and given that we have never stayed here but in the future I would stick with a property with more personalized service and less hassle  
P => Get the right floor and get a good room Myself and a colleague were in Chicago for business  We checked in early evening and there was no que  We had got a great rate through priceline com for this hotel  a night My room was on the th floor  The lifts were a bit of a faf lots of people getting in the wrong lifts for the wrong floors  My room was pretty big and a corner room so i had good views  It was very dated and had I paid anymore I would not have been too pleased My colleague had a room on the th floor  Wow his was so nice very recently revamped I would say and the bathroom was  times nicer than mine  The room was very masculine and looked like the one in the hotels own photos it was much smaller though and no view Location was superb We only had the following morning to do some shopping before we flew back home  Easy walking distance from everywhere and the hotel are happy to hold bags for free for you after you have checked out  
P => Executive Levels are the best I stayed here with my family for  nights  It pays to ask for the Executive Level because there is a different level of service there  We were initially booked for a ior suite because we were told the Executive Level rooms were fully booked  But I like the idea of breakfast and pm snacks and upgraded rooms the use of an Executive Level barlounge so I asked at check in if Exec Level rooms were available  We were lucky we got one   that weekend was busy with conferences  We got a king bed room that suited my small family fine An exclusive elevator whisks guests directly to floors  and  from the lobby and street level   a great bonus if you dont like stopping at every floor at these big hotels The am breakfast was a perfect start to a busy day of Chicago sightseeing  And the late afternoon snacks helped recharge our batteries before heading out for the evening  Our room was well furnished and clean  The bathroom was small but luxuriously appointed  And there was plenty of seating for working and reading  The bed is ultra comfy with high end sheets  We asked for a fridge but be prepared to pay  for it  Staff were courteous and cleaning staff very sweet  I highly recommend this hotel for business but expect to pay extra for internet coffee machines and any extras  No need for room service in as there are plenty of cafes restaurants and stores to go to Our only complaint is the pool which is small and often crowded  My  year old tried to go for a swim but the pool area was taken over by a gang of about  rambunctious teenagers who proceeded to do back flips and cannonballs into the deep end  Being such a large hotel you have to expect these things to happen   a little disappointing but you cant escape this fact We didnt have an issue with noise in the Exec levels but I imagine it can be a rowdy hotel in the lower levels  You can hear the Elevated Trains at all hours so get not facing Wabash if possible  
P => Palmer House Did Not Meet Expectations I was looking forward to my stay at the Palmer House  I got a good pre paid rate for a king room on the website  I was somewhat disappointed  The room was pint sized  Furnishings including the TV needed an upgrade  Public areas were better  Location is great so overall it is a mixed bag  If you dont expect too much and if you get a good rate the Palmer House is an OK choice but if you are expective a five star experience look elsewhere  
P => Suprised They Dont Charge You Extra for the Electricity and Water Used in Room EVERYTHING costs extra here  I chose this  star hotel in the loop because of the location amenities listed on the booking site and the comfort provided by a  star hotel  However every amenity comes with an extra cost  The quotFitness Centerquot is actually their Spa and use of the Fitness Center is an additional fee  The Pool is only accessible via the Spa and you guessed it is an additional fee  The Internet access  a day for quothigh speedquot access  The staff are excellent and kind but the Hotel seems more concerned with emptying your pocket of every nickle and dime they can find than ensuring a comfortable stay  
P => Beware of Palmer House Valet Parking I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP member who has never had any problems at a Hilton brand hotel  In a recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton my vehicle was damaged by the valet  After various contacts with InterPark the valet subcontractor they refused to take responsibility  I have also contacted Hilton brand and the Palmer House directly to the General Manager Dean Lane via email and US Mail  Neither has taken responsibility the GM won t even contact me back  I feel that it is unacceptable for a customer of the Palmer House or any Hilton hotel to be treated in this manner  I will NEVER valet my vehicle again and am considering never returning to any Hilton brand hotels in the future  
P => Disappointment at the Palmer House We arrived to our very claustrophobic room to find the quotking sizequot bed we had requested  A king size bed is usually between  feet  inches and  and a half feet wide however I am  feet  inches tall and could lay on the bed width wise with my head at one edge and my shins fell off the other side  When we asked the front desk if this was the right room they assured us that this was their definition of quotking size quot There was no mini fridge in the room and when we tried to go online we were greeted with a webpage from the Hilton informing us that the internet was available for a price of  for quotbasicquot and  for quothigh speedquot    FOR ONLY  HOURS The hand towel fixtures in the bathroom were hanging off of the wall with the holes blatantly exposed which stayed that way for our entire five day stay  There was no fan in the bathroom which was unpleasant for obvious reasons and our quotwindow viewquot on the ninth floor was somehow about eight feet away from another tall building making it nice and gloomy in our room even when it was very bright and clear outside  The room service came with an included   gratuity even when it came with hair in the ice cream AS WELL AS a  service charge making a  dessert around   The employees were very polite but it didnt make up for the lack of amenities  All in all a room costing close to  a night was a total ripoff  Why not stay at a significantly cheaper place that provides complimentary internet and doesnt lie about details like the bed size 
P => This one is a must The Palmer House is a historic hotel that has been magnificently maintained  It is centrally located to major shopping areas dont let the lack of a Michigan Ave  address fool you  It is very close to theaters and great restaurants too  I frequently stay on the executive floor which costs a bit more but you have access to sodas bottled water fruit yogurt cookies and snacks all day long  There is also a breakfast of fruit bagels cereals danish etc  in the morning with fresh juices and great coffee  We usually ask for a room with two bathrooms  The bathrooms are not huge but it is definately nice to have the extra one  Our room this year had two doubles with a pull out sofa which was very comfortable  I purposely asked for an inside room which does not give you much of a view but it keeps out the big city noise  Service was great and friendly too  
P => Disappointed at the Palmer I come to Chicago often and usually stay at the Chicago Hilton but they were having a Cubs convention and were booked solid so I opted for the Palmer House priily due to the historic nature of the hotel  I was disappointed in my stay as it was not the same caliber of the Chicago Hilton in my opinion  The bathroom was really small and I have received better towels at a Hampton Inn  I wasnt provided enough towels so I called the customer service hotline three times and no one answered  I finally called housekeeping and requested  extra sets of towels that never arrived  I had to go to the front desk to request the towels and when I returned from dinner they were in my room There was no coffee pot in the room as advertised on their website so I called the front desk and they said they were removed months ago but they have a Starbucks at the street level  The staff in the executive lounge were very friendly but I probably wont stay here again  The restaurant has no vegetarian options which is a shame for a hotel restaurant in Chicago  
P => Stolen items at the Palmer House My husband stayed at this property for a business meeting  During his  day stay his leather bag full of business items was stolen from his conference room  After being told by security and the facilities director that the problem would be looked into no resolution was provided  My husband then escalated the quest for his bag to the General Manager  After many phone calls and checking back the bag was not found  In the end no answers were given  A co worker had boots stolen from her hotel room the same weekend and the thief was cht ON CAMERA The hotel did pay for the boots but I dont know if the thief was fired  After experiencing not one but TWO incidents of stolen personal items I would strongly caution anyone from staying at this property  
P => Lovely stay I was a little worried about booking the Palmer House for my husbands birthday trip to Chicago but it has sentimental appeal for us as wed stayed there years ago  We had a wonderful time I requested and received a reated room  The room was a good size and although the bathroom was miniscule as many have noted it was bright well orated spotlessly clean and had a make up mirror and hairdryer  No complaints there  The bed was very comfortable  The hallways were nicely heated which we appreciated due to the freezing weather  The lobby is glorious and we enjoyed a drink there  I noticed many people ordering food from the hotel restaurant which the waiters would bring out to the lobby for amazing dining ambiance  What a great idea  A few notes you get the lobby but you dont get a skyline or river view from your room just a view of the buildings across the street  The staff at the front desk and bellhop station are very professional and they should give lessons to the doormen who were more interested in their own conversations than greeting guests coming and going  
P => Beautiful Historic Hotel We booked this hotel through priceline for under  per night  We didnt have extremely high expectations but after reading about the history of this hotel and all the recent reations that had been occuring we were excited  The lobby is as beautiful as everyone says  We checked in quickly and were in a smallish sized room that had been reated  There was no view other than the another side of the hotel but other than that the room really was elegant  Everything at this hotel was fantastic and was above our expectations  The only comment would be that they charge for everything  day for the gym  day for wifi etc  Other than that we had a terrific stay for a great price  
P => Enjoyed the Palmer House My five day stay at the Palmer House was mid ember   I was a bit wary after reading reviews about the small rooms at the hotel however went hoping for the best  HOTEL We stayed on the Hiltons Honors floor  Our room was a two queen sized bed room  It was quite large with one bathroom two closets and two large windows  The room had updated furniture and bedding the bathroom was very modern very clean and quite big enough for one person to get ready in great lighting in the bathroom  The beds were so comfortable that it was difficult to get out of them in the morning  The lobby area is probably one of the most ornate and beautiful hotel lobbies that Ive been in  AREA There is so much around this hotel to do  All around this hotel are streets and streets of great shopping and restaurants  Two blocks and youre at Macys HampM Nordstrom Rack to name a few  A few blocks to the east and youve got the beautiful Park  The Bean Sculpture is there and is a must see just for fun  An Art Musuem is located near the park as well  Theres a great PubRestuarant right next door to the hotel  We dined there twice because we liked it so much  There are great restaurants within walking distance on each side of the hotel  There is a CVS across the street for sodas and snacks so you wont have to pay  dollars for a Coke in the hotel  We had to hire a cab less than  dollars to go further up Michigan Avenue for more shopping  It could have been walked however it was close to  degrees outside and we were freezing  All in all I would completely recommend this hotel  I would request a room with two beds to assure a larger size  A friend also stayed in the hotel and had a nice large room     two beds  We plan on going back  
P => Beautiful Hotel great location We stayed at the Palmer for  nights     we had booked an airhotel package through southwest and originally were booked in a  double room  We arrived very early at the hotel and were able to check in at  am there was no wait in the lobby and the front desk staff was very friendly I choose to upgrade to a full suite for additional  and they waived the  early check in fee  Our room   was ready and it was huge   we had a full dining area seating for  a sitting area a bar area wfridge and a great sized bedroom with king bed  The room was extremly clean and beautifully orated it had been reated there was at least  windows in the room overlooking Monroe St  Overall a great hotel room Two things that do need to be mentioned were that we did have a great bar set up BUT it was not equipped with any of the things I would have expected i e wine opener glasses coffee maker had to be brought up I also think there should have been a microwave  The other thing that has been mentioned in many reviews was very thin walls you could hear coughing and talking with no difficulty other people we had travelled with had to deal with dogs barking next door and their neighbors nightmorning sex sessions Aside from these things I loved the hotel it was around the corner from the orangered line and the free trolley was right across the street  We were in a great spot for shopping on State St  and on a nice day the walk up Michigan would be beautiful  a bit too cold in   it was also very close to Millenium park walking distance  Given the chance I would definetly choose the Palmer House again 
P => I liked Palmer House Hilton If I had paid  per night like some people did I might have been disappointed  But we got a nice deal thru Travelocity for a New Years stay averaged less than  per night for  nights and I found Palmer House to be a great place  The location is wonderful convenient to much of what Chicago offers and the beds were so so comfy One of the best beds I ever slept in  Down comforters and down pillows too sweet and we had  pillows for each bed no skimping on that  I like a lot of pillows It would have been nice to have free wi fi but supposedly the Corner Bakery nearby has free wi fi  Unfortunately we didnt know that til too late  We did miss having internet access as I wasnt willing to pay  per day for it  The staff at Palmer House was consistently friendly and very eager to please  We did not encounter anyone there who was surly or unhelpful  In fact everyone was very cheerful and helpful which always makes for a nice hotel stay I had heard the rooms were smaller than average but our room was quite OK  It wasnt huge but it certainly wasnt cramped either  The bathroom was ble tile and very sufficient  Again not huge but was ok and very clean Overall I liked this hotel and the lobby is very beautiful  The restaurant there supposedly has great chefs and I wouldve liked to try it but we had other plans for a fancy dinner so had to skip that  I would recommend Palmer House to anyone  
P => Great location in the loop I travel frequently to Chicago and always Priceline or Hotwire my hotel for the stay  My priy goal is room quality as well as proximity to shopping dining and cultural attractions  Service and amenities is fairly low on my priority list in Chicago That said the Palmer House gave me pretty good service even though I paid  of their internet rate for the stay  Even better they were willing to upgrade me to the Executive ie Club floor for   My stay ended up being less than night for the stay    a total bargain I ended up in an Executive King Size bedroom  The room was average size but larger than I expected given the vintage nature of the building  Bathroom was very small with just one vanity  The building has been recently reated abd it showed  The room was clean and tastefully orated Service was about what I expected good but not great  Rooms cleaned on time  I asked for a turn down one night and gave a specific time and the turn down never happened Parking was expensive    night for self park across the street  This is par for the course in downtown Chicago Pool was complimentary  Spa was not Location was great    blocks from Macys Art Institute Millenium Park and theaters  Probably  blocks or so from the beginning of Michigan Ave shopping  
P => Classic Chicago Hotel My husband stayed at this hotel for business purposes and I met him for  nites  It is a great location near all the fabulous stores on State Street and the lobby is grand beautiful and adent  We were lucky to stay in a reated room but it was the size of a shoe box  The staff are hit and miss here  Some excellent others awful I had lunch with a friend in the restaurant at the lobby level and it was delicious  The christmas or for the holidays was beautiful If you dont mind a small room it is okay but be if we paid more we could have gotten something nicer  
P => Desperately needs reation I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a week right after Thanksgiving during the RSNA medical meeting  It was a once grand hotel that was in desperate need of reation  Dont get me wrong the lobby is glorious and my room was very clean  It was just the smallest hotel room Ive ever been in in the U S   It was European small  The doors are quite thin and you have a lot of hallway noise Its wildly overpriced for what it is  I wouldnt tell anyone not to stay there but only stay there if you cant find any other options in Chicago  
P => Not Satisfied My wife and I stayed at the Palmer House on Sunday  for one night after staying at another  star Hotel the previous nights  We were there for business  Upon arrival the outdoor Bellman begin arguing with the cab drivers about moving their vehicles while i was unloading the cab with the cab driver  When he realized we were checking in he begins to try to justify the argument  The Hotel and its Historic features are Great  The Hotel room was average  The toilets drainage system was flushing every   seconds all night and the Bellman and Luggage delivery person stood around waiting for a tip after their service  I thought this was very rude I always tip  This action was not practiced at the other  star Hotel attendants  I will not be staying here again  Finally before checking out on Monday  I was waiting in the sitting area on my floor and was manually turning the T V  stations and noticed a porn station around channel ish     unbelievable  thanks  
P => Very nice but   not quite  stars as advertised Very nice place but overall not quite a  star hotel I would give it a very pleasant  star rating Got great deal off priceline for  bucks so I cant complain about the price  The priceline room was for a standard  bed room I asked if there were any king size beds available  The front desk was great and put us in a room with a king size bed and did notify us it was however on a smoking floor  We we got to our room and it didnt smell like smoke at all not even a hint of smoke in the airHere is the skinny on the place the good the neutral and the badGood location was great for us lobby very nice bed was very comfey room fairly large and clean all the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful Neutral things that didnt bother me but they  bother you We had a busy day and were knocked out by days end but if your a light sleeper the L train is a wee bit noisy and the room walls are kind of thin  Bathroom tub could use an upgrade  Pillows were ent but could have used a little more fluff Negative NO COFFEE POT   I have seen this complained about alot on this website  As a quotlistedquot  star hotel there should be a coffee pot in the room  I guess the hotel would rather have the entire hotel go down to starbucks spend an hour in line and pay  bucks for a cup of joe  Potters Bar in the hotel was very nice but the drinks are pricey If you dont need the swankey ambiance of Potters go next door to Millers which is not swankey but very nice and pay half the price for your cocktails  One other negative   the  to  pm evening rush had you waiting forever for the elevators  On our way down from the th floor mind you we eventually gave up on the elevator and took the stairs In a nutshell nice place overall good location but not quite a  star place  Would I stay here again Yes if I got a deal off Priceline or Hotwire however if I had to pay the rack rate I would probabally look at other properties  
P => Beautiful Lobby Overpriced Room Compared to other Hiltons or hotels in general the Palmer house has the tiniest rooms I have ever seen  After  room swaps because I keep thinking there must be bigger rooms I gave up and just settled in  The lobby is beautiful but Im not living in the lobby  The walls at the hotel are paper thin and you can easily hear outside conversations in the hallway  Housekeeping is poor as I found leftover food from previous guests on my foot after walking barefoot  If you have to stay here for the location make sure you ask for a room that faces away from the train  Hotel was understaffed as well on a busy Chicago weekend so dont expect high quality services  Overall the Palmer House did not meet the standards and quality of a Hilton hotel  
P => Reated Beautiful Feel The History I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel  I did get it through priceline for under   But I would have been satisfied if I paid anything under  for my experience We were here for a romantic getaway  The hotel public spaces are amazing  History all around you and much more interesting than your usual quotnew agepost modernquot upscale hotel  Google quotThe Empire Roomquot which is just off the lobby to fully understand what used to happen at the Palmer  The hotel lobby and bar were buzzing the night we were there  Made for a great place to unwind and enjoy a drink  Nice Christmas Tree in the lobby   for a glass of champagne and  for a Miller Lite Welcome to a hotel bar in Chicago Cant complain though I called a couple days ahead of our scheduled stay to request a king and let them know I was proposing riage to my longtime girlfriend  We were upgraded to the executive level upon check in with no request on my behalf  BTW service and staff at the hotel were great  The room was adequate and functional room    Clean comfortable  King size bed  Nice appointed room  Small bathroom but nice and clean  Nothing more  More than fine for our wantsneeds  The executive level has a public space area for working and hanging out with friends  There is also an area for complimentary snacks an drinks during the day cookies soda water coffeetea  And at night it looked like the alcohol came out but I dont know if it was complimentary  Breakfast is also served on the executive level in the morning  We had to pass to catch a flight  But it looked nice Location is great  Shopping dining theaters and business right outside the door  We ate at Italian Village The Village  Open till midnight during the week which fit our needs just perfect  Great wine ent food  Its about  yards down Monroe from the hotel  Macys Nordstrom Rack Loehmans Filenes Basement all within a short walk for shopping The train is right outside the hotel for the red line quick   minutes to River NorthMag Mile and the Orange Line   minutes to and from Midway I have read reviews on here about small and less than desirable rooms at the Palmer  Our room was more than adequate  Perhaps when the hotel is near capacity you might find yourself in one of these small rooms  But the hotel seems to have just finished a major reation from my research  I would just request a large reated king room and I bet you will be satisfied  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and a great treat if you happen to secure it through pricelinehotwire  
P => The Palmer was Wonderful   Great Deal We stayed only one night at The Palmer House on ember th  We stayed in room   and it was a very nice updated room we booked for less than  on Priceline  Because the hotel is historical of course you are not going to expect a really large updated spa bathroom in every room  I would expect this in a luxury ranked newer contemporary hotel but I found the bathroom quite charming and the lighting was excellent  The room was very stylish and the products that were offered were good ones  I read the previous review that was so negative and I must admit I am astounded because the hotel is still a grand place  The beds were very comfortable and yes they we had two of them were doubles but very plush and with great linens  The area was perfect for touring downtown shopping areas and the Christmas season was a wonderful time to be a visitor in Chicago With Starbucks downstairs coffee was right at hand and better than what you can make in a room coffee pot  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would return back to stay anytime I had the opportunity  
P => The Palmer House Hilton A  Star Farce Remember hotel star ratings are based on the amenities offered at the location not on the quality of the rooms  In my opinion the quality of the rooms was substandard for a downtown  star hotel in a major U S  city  This hotel makes me question if I will ever stay at a Hilton property again ReviewGood Fairly clean beautiful lobbyNeutral Downtown location but on the boarder of a shady areaBad Miniature room with ONE full size bed for two adults no coffee maker in roomI could not in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone due to the size of the room and the tiny bed  I didn t even know that a  respectable  hotel chain had a full size bed as an option  I have only seen queens and kings in  respectable  hotels I guess if enjoy being in tight quarters and you can sleep comfortably in a petite bed this hotel would be fine  Paul Suburbs of Chicago 
P => Big hotel big disappointment After a lovely stay at the Hilton Financial District in Boston this was a big disappointment  I had checked on the Internet that there would be a refrigerator and coffee making facilities in the room and several sites had confirmed that this would be the case but the room had neither    of course it was so small that this was not surprising  For the most part staff who were going to get a tip were pleasant  However one fellow behind the reception desk was positively obstructive  The room was beautifully clean and we had an excellent good value meal in the bar  On the other hand in another bar I was charged  for some take away crisps  Our luggage was moved around efficiently tips at stake  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was that the pool was out of commission    the desk helpfully suggested that we use the pool at a Hilton a mile or so away  
P => Great Loop Location Spotty Cleanliness Usually stay in Chicago suburbs but my meeting schedule made it more convenient to stay in the Loop for one mid week night  Priceline dished out the Palmer House Hilton for  but in these old hotels i knew what I was in for The proverbial quotclosetquot room On check in the desk clerk tried the old quotearly check in for quot trick  I lined and started back towards the lobby  She called me back and proffered a room without the fee This Hilton was recently refurbed and the lobby is truly spectacular  I had colleagues over after dinner for a drink just to sit under the wonderful turn of the century painted ceiling  The room was very small with a view of the airshaft  But quite a deal for  I thought  Bathroom could have been cleaned better though  And these Hiltons have a stupidly high  fee for internet use  I lined and easily found a wifi connection that worked fine  
P => Convenient hotel Several family members stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for the Thanksgiving weekend  The hotel was very pretty and well maintained  It is convenient to all things Chicago   the eL the Art Institute amp Millennium Park State Street shopping Michigan Avenue etc  The buses run right in front of the hotel if you dont want to walk to the Magnificent Mile I would stay there again but would hope for a different room  The bathroom in ours was incredibly small and we only had a view of other hotel rooms  We also had a regular tv while other rooms come with flat panel tvs  The last day of our stay we had no hot water but the engineer came up and fixed it immediately  He and the rest of the staff were very friendly I do agree with another poster who mentioned that they nickel and dime you  It was  to check in early  or  to check out late depending on how late  for Internet etc  Valet parking is  per day  The early check in fee was the thing that really bugged me  Check in is  PM and check out is  AM  That being said I would stay there again  
P => Lobby is lovely the hotel is noisy The hotel lobby is beautiful  We enjoyed having a drink and listening to the live band play during cocktail hour We walked around the entire hotel the ballrooms are beautiful We had a good dinner at Lockwood the hotel restaurant Wed recommend the filet mignon  The pool is very small and was very crowded both times we went  The smell of chlorhine was overwhelming We stayed on the th floor facing Monroe Street The room had  double beds they were comfortable The bathroom was very small  The door missed touching the toilet by an inchThe biggest drawback for us was the noise from the El Train all night long  It was VERY loud  The hotel has thin walls as we could hear our neigbhors tv conversations and bathrooms If you like it quiet do not stay at the Palmer House 
P => Magnificent Lobby I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a couple of nights while I was on business in Chicago  It has a fantastic location close to Chicago attractions  The lobby of the hotel is a work of art and well worth a visit on its own  I had a great room   large and furnished with high quality products  My only disappointment was that when the tea kettles plug was stuck behind the heavy piece of furniture and I could not move it to get the plug out despite my repeated calls to the front desk it took over an hour and even then they did not show up  Every  minutes they would tell me that someone would be there momentarily so it ended up wasting an hour of my time  Finally when no one showed up I went down to the reception to complain  The manager apologized and offered a  gift certificate to the lobby restaurant as compensation for the inconvenience  Again the lobby is beautiful historical and whimsical and the location is terrific  
P => Was disappointed in Palmer House Hilton We stayed at this hotel because my grandson had an interview with a colleg in dontown Chicago  This hotel was recommended by the school It is a very attractive hotel Walking in and out you are always blasted by stong gusts of wind  Minor complaint  I asked the front desk  on the day of departure if we could check out  hours later than scheduled time   She said yes but there would be a   fee  I have traveled and lived all over the world NEVER has any hotel asked for a fee for late departure  The answer is no or yes  I thought it was cheap and insuling considering the class of this hotel  I left with a very bad impression of this place very ungracious in their treatment of guests 
P => Needs to be much better I checked in to my room which was really small  Im an Honors gold card holder and this room was on a dedicated Honors floor so thhis cant be the worst they have  There was just a bed and a desk in the room   no comfortable chair no table for room service to be placed upon  When they deliver your room service breakfast they put it on the bed  The size of the bathroom was worse still The room was only clean on the surface  Jutting out from underneath the bed was a blood stained towel and a large a amount of trash  These remained for the first two of the four nights I stayed there   as did the hairclips on the carpet Room service breakfast took  minutes to arrive one morning  I called Guest Relations to tell them this and to let them know that there was no hot water in my bathroom  They just said theyd fix the water which they did but no word of an apology on either count  On other occasions when I called Guest Relations the phone remained unanswered One evening I tried to use the pool  The Guest services Directory in the room was empty the advert for the spa in the elevator told you this was on the th floor but it turns out its actually on the th floor  I went to the Spa reception on the th floor and the receptionist there directed me to the th for the pool  On the th there is a door to the pool and one toilet cubicle  no changing facility or showers  I retunred to the th floor and they told me I could access the pool form there where there were proper locker rooms but that I wouldnt be able to get back  I said this was crazy   they agreed but again did nothing further to help   so dont plan to use the pool because although it is newly reated and looking good this is impossible apparently On checking out I joined the Honors line  It didnt move and no effort was made to clear it  After  minutes I joined the main line which although slow moved eventually  The automatic doors to enter and leave the property also move way too slowly   really irritating after a number of days staying there The newly reated public areas of this hotel look great   the bar etc  but I really cant think of anything else that I enjoyed about my stay This is the first time Ive ever rated a Hilton property as terrible  Why spend millions reating a great building like this and then neglect service so badly There are way better places to stay in Chicago and after my four nighs at the Palmer House this week Ill be using them in future  
P => Good Hotel Nice hotel good location I got a good deal on Priceline that made my stay a bargain but the hotel would not have been worth the rack rate  Priceline rated it a  star but I would give it   stars at best based on the condition of the carpet somewhat thin walls and ordinary bathrobe which itself was by special request only  My advice ask for a reated room away from the noisy El  I did and was given a large comfortable room on the quotquietquot side of the property  The Blue line train from Ohare drops you off within a block of the hotel where you are close to the El and free trolley  However to get to the better restaurants and shopping areas you will have to walk or take some form of transportation north about  mile or more  
P => Good hotel but some rooms are very small I stayed at the Palmer house for a few days for a conference at the hotel Pros Stunning historic public spaces  Prompt service bag check front desk luggage check concierge etc   Dont be put off by what  appear like a daunting line up This is an enormous hotel but they seem to have lots of very professional staff to cope with lots of clients  Good location in the loop with great access to public transit all subwayel lines are accessible within a couple of blocks  Room was nicely orated  Food was fine though nothing special  Conference services appeared good  I liked the fact that they seemed to have a lot of staff just hanging out to direct people Cons My quotstandardquot room was very very small The rooms was narrow enough that the closet door barely cleared the end of the double bed when it opened  If having a small space is a problem for you I would either book a larger room or go elsewhere  
P => Wonderful experience all the way around We stayed at The Palmer House for three nights  The lobby is huge and beautiful  The check in was quick we had called ahead requesting a room with two beds and were very pleased that was honored  We were put on floor  which is the executive level  We didnt have the noise issues that others have mentioned except in the bathroom were you can hear your upstairs neighbors through the wall vent  If you are put on one of the executive floors that has nice perks that go along with it  Hopefully I can post a full trip report in a few days  
P => Redeemed The Palmer House Hilton is among my favourite Chicago hotels again  After a few negative experiences with customer service over the past couple years I had chosen to stay elsewhere on my four or five visits to Chicago a year  For a last minute trip we received this hotel thru a blind booking service and I am so glad we were able to give it another chance Of course there were never issues with quality and cleanliness of the rooms and the location is ideal for most downtown attractions and right off of the el for others  It appears the reations are complete and the redesign of the rooms is refreshing The courteous and professional service we received lasted thru every encounter from check in to check out from bell service to housekeeping  We did not require concierge service but as we walked by there were two smiling attendants available  The return to attention to their guests needs was obvious and I commend them on the improvement 
P => Enjoyable stay in Chicago I stayed for four nights in the hotel in late ober  I was concerned after reading some of the earlier reviews  On arrival in the hotel the lobby resembled a train station a conference group were checking in   once we got to reception the staff were very efficient  The rooms were spacious comfortable and clean the only issue was the paper thin walls  It would also be a good idea for the hotel to provide tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms  The hotel is very central Michigan Avenue State Street and the Navy Pier are all within walking distance  I would have no hesitation with recommending this hotel in particular for the magnificent lobby a great place to watch the world go byStaff are helpful bar food limited but good location excellent  Ceilings in the lobby are magnificent only issue is the lack of sound proofing in the rooms  
P => Good Hotel Nice Location Every city has a key hotel which has been around for years  For example the Shelbourne in Dublin Ireland is one of these hotels known for its rich history and extravagance  The Palmer House Hilton is very nice especially the lobby  But its one of those quotkeyquot hotels of the city  I think the hotel is expensive but all Chicago hotels are expensive The location is good  Youre next to the El as well as the subway lines  Close to the Magnificent Mile Sears tower and the lake  If you stay here check out Berghoffs restaurant or cafe  Authentic German food I would stay again if on someone elses dime 
P => Great stay at the Palmer House My husband and I stayed here for one night on  th  We paid only  through Priceline and I loved the hotel for the price  Check in was a breeze and took about  minutes  We were able to get into our room around noon which was nice  The room was beautiful and looked like it had been recently reated  Yes its small but it was not a problem for  of us for only one week  The location is good  Its a great place to stay if youre in town for Jersey Boys probably a  minute walk and its very close to the big Macys and Millenium Park  The walk to Michigan Ave shopping was a hike but doable  It took about  minutes  quotThe Gagequot is an Irish pub about  blocks away with a GREAT brunch  
P => Beautiful The Palmer House was beautiful  We were in town for the Chicago Hair Show and this was the only place left to stay  Boy we sure LOVED it It took me back in time  The room was recently reated and had a wonderful color palate  The carpet was new and gorgeous  The concierge was wonderful in helping us choose a restaurant and anything else we needed help with as our tub did back up with water  That is my only complaint about the whole place  There was a great restaurant just around the corner I actually think they called it the Corner cafe Anyway we ate there every morning and had lunch there a few times as well  I would highly urge you to stay there and well stay there again next year if we go to the show 
P => Great Locations Stayed there on the th   th   leading up to the Chicago athon  read the review and thought it sounded and looked good so went ahead to book it on hotwire com When we arrived we pleased with the locations of the hotel as was only about a   blocks away from N Michagan Ave main street to go up and down on Easy to walk to the hilton where we got the bus to the chicago athon expo Had dinner in the restaurant down in the lobby area and it was fantastic extremely high quality food at a reasonable price for us 
P => Nice if you really want to stay downtown The Palmer House is one of the historic hotels in Chicago and it is nice  The bed was good everything was as clean as could be expected but the hotel is noisy  You can hear everything that goes on in the corridor and vice versa   not very good I found myself on nd floor with access to the executive lounge and breakfast which I do not recall reserving  Breakfast there was nice   but quotdeluxequot as the hotel claims No way Two kinds of juice three kinds of fruit and some danish and that was all nothing exceptional at allWould I stay there again No I would choos to be in the Near North or in the Lincoln Park area where there is more life after working hours  But If you want to stay in the loop then Palmer House is fine although by no means luxury experience  
P => Birthday Weekend Just returned from a weekend stay at The Palmer House and I must say I got a great price through priceline The room was spacious with a king bed  Really only slept at the hotel did not spend any time actually in the hotel other than to sleep  The only drawback to driving a vechicle in downtown Chicago is parking what a hassle and very costly  I would definently stay at the Palmer House again but would not pay full price  
P => adequate With so many good hotels in Chicago Ritz Carlton Sofitel Park Hyatt etc you would have to have a very good reason to stay in this rather disappointing flagship of the Hilton group The refit which is nearing completion  have restored some of the original features but in the process the lobby with its magnificent ceiling has been left a little like a train station lobby complete with escalators The room sizes vary greatly  In my group one person had a very large room with a sofa whilst I was left with a modest sized room largely taken up by the double bed queen sized A few gripes include filthy towels even dirtier bath no mini bar or fridge expensive internet  and message light that would not go off On the plus side the position in much better than the other Chicago Hilton although the rooms have no ent views the or is fresh the bath amenities nice and the bed comfortable  Breakfast was nice although other than the buffet there was only a very limited choice  Service was generally good especially in the bar which was lively Overall it is an adequate hotel but there are much better in Chicago often for the same money  
P => European splendor beautiful place with European charm  No complaints great location never like parking in Chicago though  It was  a night next door  Large beautiful lobby a touch of class  Fantastic location for downtown Navy Pier and the great Grant ParkMillenium Park too   Loved it  
P => Excellent remodel of a Chicago Loop classic I stayed here for  nights on a business trip  This property is near completion of a  million refit and it shows  Hotel front desk staff was friendly and helpful including desk and concierces  Desk attendant went out of her way to provide a free upgrade to an enormous apartment like suite complete with dining table living room wet bar with fridge two newly remodeled bathrooms flat panel TV king bed walk in closet etc  I am Hilton Honors Gold  This is an older hotel with a wide variety of rooms some of which are closet sized unlike my immense suite The all new quot hipquot living room furniture is a little strange looking and not that comfortable but the lush king size bed was great  My th floor end of hall suite was just above the quotELquot facing Wabash Street but well soundproofed and reasonably quiet  The bathrooms were modern and clean  Several ent restaurants withing walking distance unbeatable central loop location with walking distance to most major Chicago landks and attractions between Wabash and State  Free breakfast and executive club access for Honors members  Expensive parking  per night typical Chicago  
P => Adequate Stayed at the Palmer House for a training class that was help on premise The lobby is beautiful Kind of a weird layout with a lounge in the middle of it but beautiful nonetheless  The check in was quick and the staff members were very polite  everything was great and then I got to my room It was TINY Like closet tiny I cannot possibly stress how small it was Then I looked at the bathroom it was even smaller I could use the toilet start my shower and wash my hands in the sink at the same time I felt like I was back in my college dorm with a better bed I was not impressed but I was on the governments dime so I ided not to gripe This hotel is in a great location The red line is practically outside the front doors There is also a nice pub right around the other side of the building that had great food and a fun atmosphere My fellow attendees did not have the same gripes about their rooms so I assumed there rooms were not as bad as mine This is a cool old hotel with friendly staff a great location and lots of history   just make sure you dont get the tiny room  
P => nice hotel It is a nice hotel on Monroe Street close to the art institute of Chicago and to the magnificent mile the lobby is precious the rooms are very comfortable the best is the people on the conserje course they had all the information on CTA and the most important places to go  The bad it is not a free hotel and they charge you for fitness  every day and   for internet access  
P => Old Comfy Hotel A very nice comy old Chicago Hotel k Twain hosted the opening party  Staff very efficient helping with luggage and check in  Our room had two bathrooms The hotel restaurant is OK for breakfast though the Corner Bakery on the same block is cheaper  My wife and I stayed for two nights and treated ourself to dinner in the Lockwood restaurant one night    for two but it was very nice  The other night we went to the Berghoff restaurant on the next block   another old Chicago institution  
P => Beautiful Historic Hotel   currently under construction Palmer House Hilton is an absolutely beautiful historic hotel downtown Chicago very close to the famous Buckingham Fountain about    miles away from the Navy Pier  You can walk to the shore we even walked all the way to the Navy Pier  Interior is breathtaking with intricate details gold carvings murals etc  but unfortunately right now its under construction which makes getting to and from the hotel a bit uncomfortable   traffic congestion and one entrance is completely closed  The rooms are VERY nice and comfortable  Service is good they even did not put a hold on my credit card for security deposit when I asked them which I thought was great  To get to nice restaurants you need to go toward the Navy Pier there is nothing in the immediate vicinity if you dont count the hotel restaurant but otherwise great hotel and great location  
P => Beautiful hotel under reation We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in e for a girls weekend  Our room was lovely and looked recently reorated  It was also very large and we comfortably set up a cot with room to spare  However some parts of the hotel were under reation at the time and the second bathroom in our room was completely closed  The bathtub in our room plugged up and we had to wait over an hour for them to come fix it and only after we made a second phone call  When the reations are done Im sure it will be a lovely hotel but we were a little disappointed in the service we received  On the bright side its in an excellent location within walking distance to many Chicago attractions  
P => Absolutely Fantastic Stay Had a fantastic stay in the Palmer House hotel stayed for a week in ust  staff were so nice and helpful location was brilliant our room was just beautiful so clean and comfortable  pure luxury l thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone  
P => It was   nice Stayed at this hotel for a few days when I was in town for a conference Pros  beautiful lobby great service good room service food they brought me milk for no charge  great locationCons  incredibly expensive internet that isnt even wireless   I didnt bother paying for it   its like  bucks a day and up   not worth it   do what someone else said and go to the corner bakery around the corner and use their free internet    the room service was a bit pricey I ordered a late dinner and breakfast during my stay but was on time    one entrance is blocked because of the construction they are doing   they wont let you check in early     poor cell phone reception in the lobby area  except for near the main elevators   guess where I was forced to wait for check in housekeeping came so early in the morning   earlier than I have ever had them come in any hotel 
P => Construction I got a  deal from Hotwire to stay here  Which I was excited about until I saw all of the construction on an entire outer side of the hotel  The EL line outside of the other entrance was also under construction  Once we dodged all of the construction and made our way to the actual check in area we didnt have any problems  We got a king size room which was pretty average  The lobby is beautiful but everything else is what you would expect for  a night  Glad I didnt pay rack rate  Excellent location staff was friendly rooms are not sound proof  Bachelorette party coming in across the hall at am should have been made aware of that  
P => Staying here made my vacation better and easier  Great experience from check in to check out just a phone call from the room  Kathy at the concierge desk gave us GREAT tips  she knows her stuff  Take my advice   take the Greyline tour  Theres a PC in lobby to check flightsprint boarding passes  The restaurant food is delicious  Location is perfect forcatching taxis city bus train walking shopping eating or seeing shows  Rooms are clean  Everyone was polite and helpful  So many positives outweigh the thin walls  
P => Over Priced Hotel in Chicago Palmer House Hilton in Downtown Chicago ILDate Labor Day Weekend Reviewer Couple from Louisville KY going to have fun for the weekendThe hotel is historic and beautiful But beware when the first thing they ask you when you check in is quotWould you like to upgrade your room for   a nite quot Our room was very expensive to begin with but in a great location for us  The size of the room was fine but for an expensive hotel it had just a full size bed There was plenty of room for a queen size but they want you to upgrade for the   to get a queen size bed  Also wifi was   a day   in the UPS buisness center they charged by the  minutes to use the internet  The pool was closed and the gym cost   a day This hotel just kept having charges for every little thing  They are plenty of hotels in downtown Chicago in great locations that include all of these extras in the nightly room fee  I will be choosing one of them next time 
P => Got engaged in Chicago stayed here staff were amazing Stayed here in the winter although a  min walk from Michigan Mile it was still a great and accesable location  The lobby area is stunning altough it can be quite busy but definately a nice atmosphere  The staff were great they helped me with my plans to propose and arranged for balloons and champagne etc to be put in our room whilst we were out  Definately worth staying here 
P => Resting On Their Laurels There is no hotel with a more beautiful lobby or a more ust history than the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago  However guests dont sleep in the lobby and heritage is no substitute for customer service  From the moment my wife and I arrived we were made to feel as if the Palmer House Hilton was doing us a big fat favor by letting us stay there  The doormen and bellmen ignored us and the desk clerks were indifferent about serving us  When I asked the bartender for change for a fifty he flatly refused uttering something that sounded quotSmall bank I have small bankquot Our room was cramped with a bathroom even more so the toilet paper dispenser only had the final remnants of a single roll when we arrived  As far as the furnishings the word quotadequatequot is appropriate but given the reputation of this hotel we had been led to expect better  Our room had nothing to distinguish it from a typical Best Western or Country Inn amp Suites except for the fact that it was smaller and the bathroom didnt even have a curved shower curtain rod  Also disappointing was a general attitude of quotcharge em for the lights extra for the mice two percent for looking in the mirror twice quot We ended up spending thirty dollars for high speed internet over two days  We booked on Priceline com so the room itself was  dollars a night a spectacular price for downtown Chicago simply put we got what we paid for  Do yourself a favor fellow traveler Stay at the Monaco where your room will be extravagant and the staff will see that youre treated like a guest rather than an imposition  If the fact that Charles Dickens never stayed at the Monaco is a problem for you walk three blocks to the Palmer and check out the lobby  Just dont ask the bartender for change  
P => Nice lobby small and outdated rooms    I stayed here for  nights over labor day weekend and had an OK experience  The rooms were pretty small and seemed outdated  The bathroom was pretty small as well with very little amentities  The lobby was very nice as was the fitness center however they charge  a day for the fitness center which was not indicated anywhere on the website and a BIG disappointment  The hotel is very centrally located and the red line is right outside  I would recommend this hotel on a tight budget but dont expect much more than the basics  
P => Busy Busy Busy Excellent We spent a week here on out US Trip  I was informed it was a busy hotel and it indeed was  No doubt the busiest Hilton l have stayed at anywhere in the world Be that as it  we were welcomed everywhere from reception to the door staff The rooms were ok but the position was indeed excellent They say it is quieter on Friday anmd Saturday  be I have no complaints whatsoever and would recommend that you take a drink in the exquisite louge You are in walking distance for nearly everything Excellent value  
P => Historic in reation good location great price This old hotel is being restored to grandeur  The lobby bar and restaurants are great  The rooms are in good repair basic still  You cant beat the location and price  The concierge service was the best we have ever experienced  
P => Old world elegance  The Palmer House Chicago is a wonderful option for those visiting Chicago and would like to take a step back in time  The lobby of the hotel is the finest I have ever visited and is adorned with gold leaf nearly everywhere you look The room was on the small size but perfectly acceptable considering the age and style of the property  The bellman was extremely nice to chat with and assisted me with my luggage however on the way out of the hotel I was subject to a patronizing rek by one of the baggage attendants Other than this slight miscue everything at the Hilton Palmer House was world class and very much worth a visit while in Chicago  
P => Location great Rooms not so much I read all of the reviews and ided to be open minded  The hotel is still under reation and the main entrance is currently on Wabash  I was assigned a room on the th floor and because of a previous experience with a hotel and a fire alarm situation I asked to be located on a lower floor  My new room was on the th floor  I knew before hand that the hotel did not provide a coffee maker hello this is  but was informed that guests could rent one for the duration of their stay  No Longer true  I brought instant coffee and creamer with me Yuck  Supposedly a Starbucks is moving in on the first level soon  My room was very small I mean small The bathroom door opened up to the toilet  Also my closet door did not close  The view from my window was a iron clad wall and I had to pin my curtains shut to close them all the way  The staff was cordial especially the bellhop and the Lockwood hotel restaurant bartender  The location cant be beat but if you have breathing problems you might consider staying somewhere else because of the taxi congestion and the hotel being situated directly next to slightly under the quotLquot  
P => Best Location in the City We got a steal on our room at the Palmer House Hilton this year Booking with Pricelines bid made it cheaper than chain motels on the outskirts of town The hotels lobby is gorgeous  We were lucky enough to stay in a brand new room  Its not a huge room but its definitely comfortable and the toiletteries are Crabtree amp Evelyn which I adoreBut the best thing about this hotel is the central location  Its walking distance from Buckingham Fountain The Mag Mile the Art Institute and every one of Chicagos free trolley lines We enjoyed our week long stay very much 
P => Dont be fooled by Hilton name Amazing or nice historic hotel  It could be a great hotel if managed properly   The main problem is the attitude of the staff  They are unfriendly obnoxious indifferent  I am not talking about housekeeping who were relatively friendly but about reception concerge and business center staff who behaved like doing a big favor by paying attention to you  As HHonors diamond VIP which is Hilton highest tier   so I obviously stay quite a bit in Hiltons  I just cannot recall being treated with such attitude anywhere in the world  I dont know whether the problem is due to the lack of training or hotel hirig polices or due to racial tensions in Chicago I am coming from Canada where these are virtually non existent  Hotel doesnt have adequate security with easy access from the street arcade everyone can enter the elevators unnoticed  Coming back from dinner I ended up riding the elevator with vomit smelling street drunk who was sporadically pressing all buttons   When raised this issue with reception I received an answer that they cannot put steel barriers to prevent people from entering the building   And speaking of elevators be prepared to wait for an elevator for about  min in the morning and about  min the rest of the day  I guess its the price of staying in historic building  Yet the hotel lobby is fantastic and room oration is really good  I dont regret staying in this hotel apparently it is longest running hotel in North America but the service is certainly not up to Hilton standards And BTW be aware that health club is only free if you are diamond VIP member  
P => Very nice reated hotel solid  star This hotel is beautifully reated The loungelobby is really something to behold  I have stayed at this hotel twice for business and was impressed  Although it is super busy it is also very private and quiet  Be sure to ask for a reated room  Everything is clean grand and busy I highly recommend it for business and for visitors to the city  For those travelers see below that want free coffee  They do not have this and there is a reason    Usually those coffee machines are filthy dirty  Starbucks is opening soon on the street level 
P => Fantastic Location Average Service My associate and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton on Saturday ust th   Upon checking in at approximately  P M  I was advised that the only two bed rooms available were on a smoking floor  I reluctantly agreed to this unfortunate situation so it was my choice but I have to say that it is rather disappointing to be hornswaggled into a smoking room just to get two beds  Other than that the place is beautiful the location is perfect and I found it to be well appointed in general  My advice to anyone staying at the Palmer House who has booked on Priceline or Hotwire is to check in as early as possible  It is possible that travelers who book via the discount websites would appear to fall at the bottom of the priority list in terms of room choices  
P => Very rude staff The Palmer House is without question a beautiful hotel  But the staff acted as though they were doing us the favor by letting us stay there  While staying there we were there five nights the cleaning staff left our hotel room door open once all day and when we contacted the front desk about it they acted as though we were a nuisance for bothering them  They were likewise disaffected and rude during a discussion of charges over the room  Also though Internet is increasingly offered for free to hotel guests at even the cheapest hotels be prepared at the Palmer House to pay at least   a day for broadband Internet thats their slowest speed    for faster ones you will pay up to    Also be prepared to spend up to  a night for parking thats a flat rate no matter how long within a  hour period your car is there  In short if you dont mind paying a lot for normally complementary things and dont mind being treated poorly by the staff the Palmer House does provide a clean place to stay in a prime location  
P => Busy busy busy Stayed one night Sat  y   via Hotwire    altogether good price for downtown Chicago  Never seen such a busy hotel Lines for check in at pm lobby and lobby bar full of people milling about even out on sidewalk in front of hotel people loading and unloading from cars and taxis  Pleasant desk receptionist  Allocated room    HUGE  x  yes I paced it out By contrast bathroom is SMALL but functional  Looked as if room and bathroom were quothalfwayquot modernised in a kind of art o yucky green Interior room overlooking fire escape and buildings so no street noise   just inconsiderate guests in hallway at  am Comfortable beds toiletries provided  For price paid was ok   of course drinks at lobby bar were usual downtown Chicago prices i e   expensive  AC worked fine  
P => Caffeine free Zone If you stay at a Motel  you get free coffee  Super  same  This Hilton no way  Couldnt believe it but its true  No coffee pot in the room no coffee pot in the lobby  The morning street level not the lobby which is one floor up is a steady stream of bleary eyed people walking out to the street to find the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts or McDonalds and the opposing stream of people coming back to the hotel with a cup or two of     coffee  Cmon Hilton have a heart A cup of joe would make life just a lot better Oh by the way the walls are pretty thin The shower was great Wi fi daily rates are exorbitant Check in and  out were a breeze The wait for an elevator was never more than a minute Sheets are SOFT  
P => Crowded busy hotel We got a great deal on a room at the Palmer House so ided to stay there  It was clear upon check in that you get what you pay for  Our room a Studio was tiny  Im not kidding    I know people with walk in closets bigger than the room we had  It was long and narrow with one full size bed located right inside the door  Past the bed they had crammed in all of the furniture that they put in regular sized rooms  One dresser would have been fine    we really didnt need the desk and chair across from it because you had to move the chair away from the desk to open the bureau drawers  The only other issue was the feeling of a constant crowd in the hotel  The only time I have ever had to stand in a long queue literally snaking between velvet ropes to register was when we went to Las Vegas  The Palmer House Hilton had the same feel as a busy Vegas hotel     all hustlebustle and no elegance or personalized service  We were awakened both nights once at AM and the next night at AM by screaming teenagers coming back from partying  Since the bed was right by the door we could hear everything in the hallway which didnt exactly make for a pleasant nights rest  My advice    stay there for the location and the price if you can get a good deal on the web but beware 
P => Great location and loved the room I book through priceline for a  a night but saw in some of the reviews people getting it for  a night  Yet after staying there paying a little bit more was no problem  My wife and I stayed there for  nights and really enjoy it  We arrived earlier between  and  pm and had no problems checking in early and was given a King sized bed  Some of the reviews had said the rooms were small but when you are travelling with just two people you dont really need anymore room  It was also nice to have a safe in the room that you could lock up any valuables you had  The place is quite busy as it has over  rooms so if you do not like crowds this is not the place for you  As well they are currently doing construction so the pool is not open which was a little disappointing  The one thing I thought was ridiculous was that you had to pay   a day for Internet  So we found a place at the corner of Wabash and Monroe beside the hotel where you could get free wireless  We both love the place and would stay there again for sure  
P => If You Like Crowds This is Your Place We had to stay at this hotel because we were invited to a family wedding and all our immediate family members were staying here  The entrance is right under the elevated train and the immediate feeling is one of chaos  That feeling continues into the lobby where there were hoards of people milling around and waiting to check in  The lobby is grand and beautiful though with a ceiling that one can stare at and admire for hours  Our room was on the executive level which needed a special key for the elevator which meant that every time we had guests who were not on that floor we had to accompany them  Also if we wanted to visit guests not in that area we had to descend to the lobby and take a different elevator to reach their floor  We had dinner in the private dining room and the service was fantastic as was the food  Our room had a huge living room and dining area that was arate from the bedroom  There were also two full baths which my husband and I really appreciated since they were each very tiny  Its a grand old hotel and the or matches that  The location is wonderful  Its only a short walk to the Art Institute and the shoreline with all its beautiful walkways and parks  
P => Great Location The hotel itself is very nice  Cons Our room faced the train and the window would not shut completely so it was a bit noisy  The internet is super expensive  The poolspa was closed due to reations Pros The rooms are reated and stylish  The service was great Also next door to the hotel there is a bakery with free Wifi you are about a block away from the Millennium Park and Art Museum  
P => Great Location for Chicago I booked through Hotwire and if you book through them or through priceline you will be given whatever room is left over whether it fits your needs or not  The person at the front desk said that they only accomodate people who book through expedia  So we had to stay in a one double bed room even though I was travelling with my  children  The room was tiny  I ordered a rolling bed and it barely fit in the room  The room had a view of the fire escapes but the new or is gorgeous  It made this tiny room look inviting  The bathroom was small but had one of those cool bowl sinks  This room would be adequate for only  person not   They did move us to a two double bed room the next night and we fit much better  The second room also had the new or and I found it very attractive  The bathroom somehow was smaller than the first one but we had a walk in closet  The location is excellent for sight seeing  The city of Chicago offers free sightseeing trolleys through the summer and two of the lines have stops in front of the hotel and the third line has a stop  blocks away  It ends up being so cheap to see all of Chicago without ever having to take a bus or a cab  Be sure you dont miss the fireworks at Navy Pier on Wednesday and Saturday nights  It makes this magical city even more magical Hilton does not offer any services for free  So you will be charged a fortune for internet breakfast and even to use the fitness center  They are still under construction so the pool was not open  The location does offer you several places where you can get breakfast lunch or dinner for a fraction of the cost  It is also two blocks from Millenium Park and the Art Institute and shall Fields Macys  
P => The Best Location in Downtown Chicago I recently went to Chicago on y    I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and I must say that I had a very lovely time  I was right in the middle of everything  The free trolley is around the corner shopping is close food is close the train is close I mean it is the perfect location  My room was lovely  double beds nice size bathroom nice tv  I did not know what to expect but I can tell you that anything on the  floor and up is nice  We stayed on the th floor and was told that they started remodeling about a year ago and started on the top floor  We were a ok  The staff was excellent from the doorman to housekeeping to check in clerk to the maintance guy who gave me a new remote control  Just great service  
P => Beautiful even though not completed reation I stayed here for a wedding with the rest of my family in a reated room  Becuase we asked for a reated connecting room we had to wait for  hours to get the room  We arrived at around  PM and check inn was at  but the room was not ready until   The front desk staff we originally not very friendly but after they found out we were part of the wedding party they were very friendly for the entire stay which was odd  The hotel is huge so if a nice quiet hotel is what you want this place is not for you  The room was really nice with all new furinishings  The room was extremely clean and the bed was extremly comfortable  I could not belive how thin the walls are  You can hear every word that anyone is saying beside you in the hallway and even across the hall in rooms over there  You can also hear if they are in the bathroom as you can hear practically anything  Also try to get a room on the other side from the El  Even being on the other side you could hear it  The poolfitness centre was closed for reation which was a downer but they moved the exercise room into the confrence room and the strange   fee was waived We were given brunch coupons becuase we were part of the wedding and if I had to pay for the food I would have been very upset  The food was absolutely terrible and I counted  waiters the whole time I was in there  We checked the menu for lunch and dinner and it was a ripoff  There are tones of places to eat for all three meals all over the area Parking was very expensive with valey   a day  Chicago is a great city and you can practically get anywhere with public transit and there are always lots of taxis available  The staff at the door were very nice but the lower concourse was shut down so you have to walk up the staircase to the really nice lobby to get to the elevator  Overall it was a really nice stay and we would come again once they complete the reation and everything is open  
P => Not worth the price I stayed here as part of a business trip  My meeting was at this hotel For the price at a quotfull servicequot hotel I expected much more  Granted it is a historic place but for  per night what we got was the room which was quite small had a view of the building and a tub that took  minutes to drain after a  minute shower Internet access costs around  per day There is a big fee to use the fitness facility as well and it is nothing special The staff is very friendly however We didnt eat at the hotels restaurant   wasnt impressed with the menu for the prices  Walked  blocks to a historic italian restaurant and got a full dinner for two for the price of one entree at the hotel If you do happen to stay here   there is a place called the Corner Bakery Cafe just down the block   great breakfast coffee sandwiches pasta is ok soups and cakescookies   good prices  Breakfast with coffee was less than  
P => Never Again A colleague and I booked a room here this past  for three nights  We were assured that a room with two double beds would be available but when we got there they told us that there were none but added that a rollaway bed could be brought up to the room for  a night  The front desk clerk was one of the most rude and condescending people Ive ever dealt with  We turned them down on this offer and asked if we could be put on a waiting list for a new room  I reiterated again that we were assured a room would be available and the clerk told me that she quotwasnt sure what Priceline promisedquot but there were no guarantees  The first night I slept in a chair while my colleague took the bed  The next day we were given the good news that a room  come up but the catch was we had to be in the hotel to receive the room or it would be given to someone else  We were told that wed have an answer by pm  pm came and went finally we were told at  that the room would be available after wasting a perfectly good afternoon waiting in the hotel lobby  To add insult to injury upon checkout they tried to bill me for the rollaway bed even though it was never brought to our room  The only bright spot in this whole place was the building itself and the conceirge service the other staff could learn many lessons from them  They were phenomenal offering great suggestions  I would warn anyone about staying here especially if they booked through an online travel service  If you book through Expedia Priceline or the like youll be treated like a second class guest  A flat out horrible experience  
P => Great Location Rooms could be big or small Fabulous Location near Millenium Park and State Street shopping Stayed here twice for business  First time my room was a quotclosetquot   the bathroom  closet and the room were so small I barely had room for my suitcase  There was no counter space in the bathroom   people would not have fit in that room  For my last visit I specially asked for a room NOT like my last stay and bigger than a closet  My room during my latest visit was perfectly fine with  beds nice closet  The bathrooms were still small but at least there was counter space  Its a dice roll on what kind of room youll get  Be specific on your request  There are many closet sized rooms in the inventory Common areas are very beautiful but the layout of the lobby is awkward  Check in is on the second floor The proximity to the El can bother light sleepers as I could hear the trains Convenient to Corner Bakery on same block  CVS across the street  State street shopping around the corner Rooms were pricey  I would stay here again only if I received a better deal than a Mag Mile hotel  I would prefer to stay on Michigan Ave for the same price  
P => Dont pay big bucks for this place It has definite pros the location is great the lobby is beautiful the staff was pleasant and professional  However I have NEVER stayed in such a stripped down room ANYWHERE  The bathroom is tiny with a pedestal sink and no counter  Shampoo conditioner and soap ONLY  No lotion  No shower cap  No coffee  No wet bar  No free internet  Paper thin walls through which we could easily overhear our neighbors conversations  The whole place is torn up right now   one entrance open no fitness center to speak of workers tarps and paint fumes galore  If youre thinking Hilton   four star luxury like I was you are so wrong  DO NOT pay anything close to rack rate  If I hadnt gotten such a deal on the rate I would have been furious  
P => Great Location Stayed at the Palmer House for Girlfriend Getaway during the Taste of Chicago  I was disappointed with the room  It was small had a brick wall for a view and the bathroom barely had turning around room  BUT                                  This is a great location  It is close to shopping and attractions in the downtown area  We were a couple of blocks away from Grant Park where the Taste was  The service is very very good  The staff is very helpful and courteous  And even though the room was small the bed slept well and the or was very nice and classic  
P => Okay for the price and location The hotel is on a very busy street the subway makes the street very noisy during the day  Theres still construction going on swimming pool and main entrance closed  We parked at  State St  across from the hotel for  USDnight ouch However we got a cheap price for the room USDnight booked through hotwire com Surprised to see in such expensive hotel that there is no shower cap in the bathroom and no coffee maker  Also the mattress was very soft I would say very old sagging With all the noise from the streetth floor facing Wabash St where the subway goes by on the elevated line I was concerned it was going to be noisy however the windows were double panels and did a good job insulating us from the noise below in the street and I am a light sleeper The corner bakery just in the corner of the building is great for breakfast very fast and good food I definitely recommend it good way to start the day All in all an average experience the good part was the location and I guess the price even after factoring in the car parking We used the free trolley system to save our feet after too much walking  The Greek town is just a handful of restaurants nothing more good food though We walked   blocks south to the Guys Blues place one evening the place is alright but we werent lucky with the band that night avoid Texas Fire Band never heard of blues in Elvis Presley rock and roll style  
P => Our Kind of Town I took my wife to Chicago for her th Birthday and our three nights at The Palmer House Hilton made it truly memorable  Our first room was a bit small but this being an grand old hotel that was expected  We did however inquire about a possible move to a bigger room and Erika at the front desk was more than willing to help  Wow Did we ever get a bigger room Huge two bathrooms a sitting area     It was great  The Hotel itself is in the middle of a large reation but there was no noise and little inconvenience  The lobby is beautiful the staff helpful the location   right downtown and close to everything   was perfect  Make sure you walk the three block to the new Millennium Park in Grant Park  Thank you Hilton for a great stay and a great birthday celebration for my wife and me  PERFECT 
P => Not the Hilton experience one would expect We paid  per night for this hotel and I must say it was not worth it  When I saw pictures of the hotel lobby online I figured it would be an amazing hotel with wonderful rooms  This was not the case  The rooms were dated with approximately s window treatments  Carpets in rooms and hallways were not plush or cozy  Also the lighting in the room and hallways was dark  My expectations for Hilton were very high as I have never had a bad experience till now  We paid  for night through Priceline  I am sure it is far more expensive directly through Hilton  It is not worth the money  Go for the Hilton Chicago near the Magnificent Mile instead  
P => Palmer House Hotel Recently stayed in Chicago overnight with mother  and teen dhter  we stayed at the Palmer House it rocked and ate dinner at Attwood Cafe loved it and our server Rachel and saw Wicked totally worth every penny  We did regret not having umbrellas with us it rained off and on suddenly would have liked larger beds at the Palmer but the gorgeous rooms and lobby made up for it as well as Phillipe the concierge who was very informative  And the Corner Bakery was the best for breakfast and lunch very reasonably priced and deliciousLove it and plan to return over the th of y for Taste of Chicago and more fun plus more nights    this time at riott Downtown got a steal of a deal by signing up on their web site and then back again in late y for a trip to the Blackwood Renassaince hotel  
P => Nice Hotel After reviewing hotels in Chicago we picked the Palmer House Hilton  The rates were very expensive but we liked what we read and were determined to stay here  Three days before we left I realized that I could bid on this hotel via Priceline  Our original price through the hotel web site was  for  nights through Priceline we paid   Good things about the hotel are it is in a convienent location it is beautiful and a nice lobby  A couple of the nights we had cocktails and dessert in the bar area  It is a perfect place to people watch  Bad things about the hotel were the quotcrazinessquot of the lobby area and the confusing layout  When we walked in with our luggage not one person greeted us and we wandered along looking for the registration area  Once we finally made it there thanks to a couple of friendly hotel guests the employee Eric at registration was very nice  He apologized for the confusion and upgraded our stay to a bigger room  And after reading the other reviews about the small rooms Im glad we had a bigger room A side note there is a lot of construction going on at this time  The quotgymquot area is very hard to find and if you are desperate for a workout it is ok  
P => Beautiful old hotel The reviews for this hotel vary so widely that I wanted to add my very positive experience to the others  Stayed here for four days with my dhter while on a mini vacation to explore a new city  The Palmer House is a fabulously restored very old hotel our room was gigantic and newly orated  couldnt have been nicer  All was clean and fresh  Others have reported moldy bathrooms dirty carpets etc  and I would be unhappy with those things too but did not come across anything bad at all Our check in was quick and friendly and the concierge desk was very helpful with directions maps and suggestions  The downtown location is very convenient for a tourist  about a block from the nearest El station AdamsWabash and the Art Institute Millenium Park etc  I dont understand why the reviews are so mixed be this isnt a brisk hotel for business travelers and is better suited for people on vacation Anyway it has tremendous charm and good service  
P => Executive Floor at the Palmer House My boyfriend and I stayed at the Palmer House in a room on the Executive Floor when I went to Chicago formerly my hometown for a wedding  This has always been one of my favorite hotels for sentimental reasons  You can t beat the location if you want to be downtown in the loop  The Palmer House is between State and Wabash at Monroe so you are right there in the middle of it all and a very short and pleasant walk to Millenium Park and the lake  The lobby is beautiful in a late th early th century ornate way  It is up a flight of stairs from the street entrance so you have to wander down the hall to find the elevators or lug your bags up the stairs  The rooms are old hotel charming but they have been on the small side every time I have stayed there and the last time I could hear everything going on in the room next door so this time I ided to treat myself and I reserved a room on the  Executive  floor  The Executive floor has its own check in its own elevators which is good bc you never can seem to get the regular elevators in this hotel lounge area with large tvs complimentary continental breakfast cereals fruits quite good pastries etc  bar with complimentary appetizers at night mini quiche spinach dip cheese etc  and as I expected larger rooms  I didn t have a good experience when we went to check in at the special check in desk which had a big sign saying something like Check In for Hilton Diamond Members and Executive Floor  The man behind the desk asked me in a not too friendly manner if I was a Diamond member and when I said no he hesitated  Although I jumped in with  we are staying on the Executive level  I was so uncomfortable that I almost just went over to the regular check in  But we got checked in The room was nice it had a small kitchen with a sink and fridge and a small sitting area  The bed was really comfy  I enjoyed my stay but I don t know if I would pay the extra money for the Executive Floor again I think my rate was  or thereabouts  
P => The Worst Big City Hotel I have stayed here before  It was OKAY but I expected after the trumpeted  Milion reation it would be better this time  Just the worst  My greatgrandparents used to stay here  be it was something then but it is nothing now  The Lobby is beautiful and the ceiling is not to be missed  but then run from this place  Phones dont work  for example if you press the message button you get the director of food and beverage  The room service button didnt work either you have to call the operator for everything and hope that they pick up  The rooms are TINY  I didnt need a remote control for the TV  I could use my toes And the bathroom  well lets just say I have suits larger that that  I had a lovely view of a fireescape and could never tell if it was day or night  Yet it is packed with conventioneers  be those are the folks that give it good reviews  I dont know but I have been here twice in  months for about a week each time and it is awful  
P => Breakdown of the Palmer House Check in Check in is located on the second floor which was a little odd with bags but it was quick on a Sunday evening  Lobby Beautiful and old  Lots of ble and gold colored things  Big and airy  Lots of high backed loveseats and arm chairs  According to one of the bartenders the Palmer House is the first hotel to have electrical lighting and elevators The Restaurant    Lockwood Retardedly expensive  A Blue Moon domestic Whit Bier was      and it wasnt even a full pint  Breakfast quotbuffetquot was   I put quotbuffetquot in quotes because it was the smallest buffet Ive ever seen  The other food on the menu looked good but I didnt try any of it  One of the bartenders told me that some locals like to come to Lockwood because once youre there youre unreachable The ble and steel in the barrestaurant block virtually all cell phone and PDA reception  The Vibe The hallways were beautifully orated with black and white photos of entertainers who have performed at the hotel  There was also a stunning art o th floor lobby with gilded mirrors peacock carpets and a purple circular couch that you can sit on while waiting for the very very slow elevators  The Room Bathroom was tiny but clean  There was only one towel rack and it was located inside the tubshower  My room had two queen beds and no view  My room was clean and the beds were comfortable  My biggest beef was that there was no wireless access  There was hardwired pay by the day Internet access which cost somewhere around  a day  
P => Never again Great location and a beautiful lobby but we had a number of complaints  First the check in process took at least  minutes and the front desk woman acted aloof and impersonal  Then we made it up to our room and it was so small we could barely move around in it  The bedding was nice but that was the only highlight of the room  Finally I gave my valet parking ticket night btw to the parking desk attendant who was very rude we waited for  minutes outside and then one attendant out there asked us for our ticket  When I told him we already handed it in a half hour ago he ran inside only to come out a bit later saying that they didnt even grab the keys  Another  minutes go by and when he  finally  pulls up in our car he had the gall to stand idly waiting for a tip  We spent the next night in the Westin Chicago River North and were infinitely more pleased by all aspects of the hotel  
P => Great Location Lousy Valet Palmer House is located in the PERFECT SPOT for visiting Chicago  Just  blocks west of Millenium Park and the Art Institute  Its a beautiful old hotel undergoing reation  We didnt get much time to explore the hotel itself but walking through the beautiful lobby area was a real treat  The front desk gave us a large room since we were traveling with  young kids which was a very generous move on their part  We found the rate on the internet and booked through a travel agent  Certainly that sized room would go for much higher if selected per the room style The only bad part of the visit was the valet service  On a Friday night it took  minutes for them to bring up our car and on a Saturday morning it took  minutes making us late for our appointment  They were understaffed and not well managed though the employees were very nice and doing the best they could under the poor circumstances I highly recommend the hotel due to its location the valet parking is  with inout privileges but if you self park in the lot  block away it is only  with no inout privileges  
P => Okay if price is competitive This is an iconic old Chicago hotel  Personally Id rather spend that money on a sleek creatively designed modern hotel of which Chicago has many  But I was looking for a location and competiitve price for a business stay and the Palmer House fit the bill  The room was small and windows were not so much  That said its old world luxury inside  If thats your thing youll like it more than I did  For me it was just okay  
P => 
P => Great Room amazing bathroom LOVED the Peninsula  Excellent Location  Loved the bar downstairs  The rooms are large and have every amenity you can think of  I loved the bench outside the closet for throwing suitcases  My son loved the fact that he could watch cartoons while taking a bath  They even gave him a little Peninsula bear to take home dressed as a bell hop  Will return  
P =>  star Excellence in Chicago If you can afford to stay at the Pennisular in Chicago please do you wont be disappointed Amer Express had a deal where you had a discounted room rate  free upgrade free breakfast one afternoon tea  I went with the Royal Tea which included champagne and caviar  We also had Sunday Bruch which was very nice  The Hotel is  star in everyway  The house keeping is quotghostlyquot where you dont see them but always see their handiwork  No carts in the hallway  The Spa was a pleasent experience where we had a couples massage  The service is so good by the time you hang up the phone for service someone is knocking at your door with your request  The rooms along with the view are wonderful however stay on upper floors due to the noise and cars on Michigan Ave The service is so good while checking out our valet took our bags and even picked up a Chicago style pizza we had earlier ordered and met us at our car as we left for home dodging Oprahs  season opening show on Michigan Ave  
P => Superb in every category I stayed for four nights in an Executive Suite at The Peninsula while visiting friends from my college days  This was my second stay at The Peninsula and it wont be my last  In addition to the stunning service and facilities I was able to get a very ent rate under one of their summer specials My room was extremely spacious see photos  arate living room entrance hallway connecting hallway etc  One of my favorite things about the Peninsula is the amount of room devoted to dressing  plenty of closet space drawers and mirrors  The sound proofing was superb  windows open you could hear sirens and all the other sounds of the city but once they were closed there was no sound from outside One of the most attractive things about this room was the bathtub with a window overlooking Michigan Avenue  I took baths just to be able to look through the window The technology is if anything over the top  I counted six telephones or equivalents like the voice operated one in the bathtub in the suite two televisions a stereo system and the Peninsula standard electronic control systems see photo  on one morning when I slept in light and housekeeping knocked on the door a long way from the bedroom I just had to roll over and hit the quotPrivacyquot button on the phone  a light turned on outside the room and that was it No complaints at all about this trip but I do have two suggestions both from The Berkeley in London   The k chairs on the sun roof outside often appeared occupied even though no one was there  it would be worthwhile to clean these more frequently or to put up a sign asking people to clear away their belongings when they were done so that more people could enjoy the sun k  Shoes left overnight for polishing should be returned with temporary shoe trees  
P => Absolute Perfection    Didnt want to leave Hands down the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in  The hotel is in a great location the room was gorgeous and the public areas of the hotel are beautiful  The service is stellar  The hotel staff knows what you need before you even know yourself but they do it in a way that is not quotin your facequot and too much  We went to the Bears game and the whole time I just wanted to get back to the hotel to enjoy the roof top bar overlooking Michigan Ave  We finally made it back and the bar was awesome not to be missed and the staff treated us to complimentary champagne for my birthday  The next day I had lunch w a friend at the restaurant in the lobby and I mentioned to her that we were there celebrating my birthday I dont even recall the waitress being win ear shot but the next thing you know there is a birthday dessert served at the table  The waitress overheard me say we were there for my birthday  I cannot say enough about the wonderful hotel  I stayed at the Trump a couple of months later and let me tell you that it PALES in comparison to the Peninsula  Not even in the same league  If you can afford it stay at this hotel when in Chicago  The Peninsula has won a regular client  Will be staying at the Peninsula in NYC soon hope I am not dissappointed 
P => A reason in itself to visit Chicago Always perfect  Period  One of my favorite hotels in the world  
P => The BEST hotel in America This is my third be fourth stay at The Peninsula Chicago  I would like to live there on a permanent basis  This was an important visit for me as it was a  day night stay with my son before he departs for his first year of college and I wanted it to be a special  The Peninsula made it an exceptional visit We stayed in a quotdeluxequot category room  which was spacious and had  very comfortable beds  The room had a good city view to the west which is not THE Chicago city view but it was still good  The room is over the top in every way  A large flat screen HDTV that pivots for viewing in the living area or the beds to go with a smaller set at the foot of the bathtub  The room had a double desk along with a full sized couch and a chair and ottoman  It also had  minibars so one did not have to walk far for refreshments The bathroom is incredibly opulent and wonderful  arate shower tub potty  full vanities The soundproofing is great  We never heard any noise from anything but ourselves andor the tv or the ipod the room has a loading dock and a dvd player A true luxury hotel it does not nickel and dime you  Each night turn down service includes a bottle of spring water for each occupant  There is excellent and free wi fi  In the morning I received a complimentary copy of the Chicago Tribune The NY Times and the Wall Street Journal The fitness club which sits atop the hotel is simply stunning  It is extremely well equipped with a variety of new cardio machinestowelsheadsetswateretc  The swimming pool is gorgeous and it has an outside k which affords some nice views The Shanghai Terrace is a delightful restaurant and was a great place to sit outside facing MIchigan Ave for appetizerscocktails andor a full meal We also availed ourselves of the bistro at the ground level which was also excellent This hotel has no flaws  What makes it all the more exceptional is the staff  A guest relations manager LeeAnn Brown saw to it that we were set up comfortablyand took it upon herself to dig around the city for some childhood treats I requested for me consisting of the candy quotChucklesquot which are hard to find these days fannie  pixies and Jays potato chips all of which are unique to Chicago  She went beyond the extra mile and had  white sox hats in the room for my son and me knowing we were going to a game  Upon checkout she came out and introduced herself to me and could not have been kinder or more competent throughout  It is people like Ms  Brown that make The Peninsula not just a very good hotel but rather a great hotel I look forward to returning to Chicago for its many pleasures but moreover to treat myself to another visit at The Peninsula  
P => Nice hotel excellent service but overpriced and overhyped I stayed three nights at the Peninsula Chicago Hotel for a business conference  This was my first stay at a Peninsula Hotel  I stayed as part of the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program  I had an executive suite no upgrade and spent a great deal of time in the room working  Perhaps it was all the hype I heard about this chain of hotels in advance that truly raised my expectations but I was a bit underwhelmed  Don t get me wrong this is a very nice hotel but there are areas that could use improvement  Here are my observations about this hotelGOOD  The service is predictably excellent  The very best  You are greeted by everyone with a smile  Responses to your requests are immediate  The housekeeping is the best I ve ever experienced  They are like  service ninjas  who somehow detect those rare moments when you  not be in your room and they make it immaculately clean within  minutes  Laundry as well was very quick  When I arrived at the hotel my suit and a couple of shirts I packed were a bit wrinkled  They took care of them all within an hour    Free wireless internet throughout the hotel   The food was pretty good for the most part  The kobe burger was good as was the creamless tomato soup  The afternoon tea service is great    The fitness center was nice not as large as hotels like the Four Seasons which have a Sports Club LA in them but sufficient and very well kept  There were only a couple of other people in there when I went to work out so I got to use all the equipment I wanted without a problem    The desk in the room was good  I like a big desk when I travel for work  It gives me room to use my laptop open up binders and multitask  I was easily able to do that  I wish though that they would position it in a way that would allow you to take advantage of the views while you work  See my comment below about how the bottom drawer should be used for a printer not a fax   The bathroom was very nice  Good standup shower and nice bathtub that overlooks the city  Having a small TV screen next to the bath was great as well  Only complaint in that part of the room was that the stopper in one of the two sinks didn t work and the water took a while to heat up    The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows  A in this department  BAD  When I arrived there were two gnats in my room  Not a big deal but I was surprised  One of them was killed when it took a nose dive into my soup at lunch which I had fortunately pretty much finished   The technology in the room is a bit outdated  True there is the high tech control panel that you can use to change the lighting TV channels and air conditioning  On the other hand there were no flat screen TVs in my living room or bedroom no high definition or HDMI no iPod radio and the telephones not portable are old    one of mine had to be replaced because it didn t work properly  There s a fax machine in the desk drawer but quite frankly I don t know of many people who use those very much   most communication is done by e mail these days  The space would be better used by a printer  There s a stereo in the living room but it looks like something my father owned in     Prices were RIDICULOUS I expected to pay a ent amount of money because this is a top notch hotel but some things were lhable     for a cappuccino to be delivered to my room  Two course meal for one person    no alcohol  Spa was outrageously overpriced    The room was not well insulated from the noise  I constantly heard sirens car horns and beeping noises from the street  floors below  I also heard when people above me were turning on their water    There was a horrible air freshener smell on my floor  It s not throughout the whole hotel and I only traveled to my floor so I don t know whether it was an issue with my floor or all floors but it was clearly a scent that was there on purpose  CONCLUSIONThe Peninsula hype I received before I arrived was a little too much  This is a nice hotel but I ll probably try a different one next time I m in Chicago  The service is excellent but the rooms are a bit dated which results in some minor annoyances  More than anything else it is very overpriced  I realize that you pay a lot for a top flight hotel and Im willing to do that but I think I probably could have paid less and received more at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton  
P => Off the charts good  This is a spectacular hotel  There isnt one thing I could complain about  The service ammenities location and room were all great  It is very expensive but you get what you pay for  Flat screen in the room iPod dock free wi fi the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept on and one of the best showers Ive ever had in a room  Everything is first class Im not sure Id take kids here although there were some around  The pool is nice but mostly set up for lap swimming and there is a hot tub as well  Both are indoor  
P => An enjoyable experience I booked this trip at the last minute so naturally the rate was pretty high  Ive read so many favorable comments about the Peninsula that I just had to check it out for myself  Needless to say I was not disappointed  The service I received from the moment I stepped in front of the hotel greeted warmly by valet until the day I departed was memorable  I am hooked  While there I visited the pool area and felt so relaxed I fell asleep in no time  The iced lemon water and iced strawberry water was a nice touch  Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was nice as well  I also visited the bar and received great service  The servers were friendly and offered great suggestions on where to view the fireworks  Fridays amp Saturdays the hotel provides live jazz in the lobby area where you can enjoy cocktails and meals  The lighting was perfect for the setting  I must say the thing that I like the most was the control box that is placed on the nightstand  You can control the TV the lights and the alarm clock  No more looking for the remote  I must get one for my bedroom  One other thing that I found favorable was the fact that the hotel places your newspaper in a small handled bag which is hung on the door knob  No more bending down to retrieve the newspaper  The money was well spent  I can hardly wait to return  
P => Best Luxury in Chicago These comments are a year delayed we stayed in    Peninsula Chicago is by far the best luxury in Chicago    perfect location boutique like stellar personal service gorgeous spa beautiful ble bathrooms in the rooms traditional rooms with modern amenities and superb linens  Absolutely the best in five star luxury in Chicago  NB We viewed our friends room at the Four Seasons Chicago and while perfectly adequate for a hotel in general for five star it seemed a bit stale and outdated the common areas of the Four Seasons were unimpressive for quotfive starquot    if youre spending this kind of money absolutely opt for the Peninsula vs  Four Seasons  gt no contest  
P => Well Located Probably the best hotel in Chicago considering the location and quality of the property  
P => Five star hotel of Palatial Proportions in a great location This is with out a doubt the finest hotel in Chicago  Everything about it  star plus  My room was large the windows opened so you can let in fresh air and hear the city sounds  The location is right on Michigan Avenue in the middle of the Magnificent Mile  There is a great reception area a large lobby restaurant and bar a caf  with outdoor seating and everything else you could want  The indoor lap pool is huge has a view from the th floor and has an adjacent outdoor seatingsunning area also with a spectacular view  The hotel lacked nothing  Everything it has is spectacular  And it was all priced accordingly e g  my room service breakfast of blueberry pancakes and coffee for one was   On the bright side the in room wifi is free and worked great  I cannot think of anything that was less than perfect  Needless to say I would highly recommend this hotel to others who want and can afford this luxury  One more note on the area right across the street is the Rosebud Cafe with some of the best Italian food ever with large portions reasonable prices and great outdoor seating  A must go to in Chicago  
P => Best Weekend aside from our Honeymoon I booked a Fri and Sat Night stay at the Peninsula for my wife and my st wedding Anniversary  To simply put it the Peninsula exceeded our expectations of luxury service and relaxation  Check in was fine it is a nice touch for the front desk attendant to peronally escort you to your room give you a brief tour and inquire of any other needs  The Deluxe king we booked was very clean spacious and comfortable  The kingsize bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and soft comforter The bathroom was very large ble everything the highlight is the tvradio controls for use while in the bathtub  The deep soaking tub and erate shower have excellent water pressure and space for two On Saturday night we went to the lobby for the Jazz at the Pen  The jazz quartet was very good able to read and play off of the crowd The spa and finess center were top notch  The pool is very nice and sun filled there is an outdoor sunk but it can get quite windy  floors up Room service housekeeping and the front desk staff are very efficient and accomodating Our weekend at the Peninsula Hotel was arguably the best we have ever had aside from our honeymoon  
P => What a town what a hotel what a meal    Great  nights at The Peninsular where the service was supreme the room great the location perfect and the food delightful Ate the mad  course tasting menu at Avenues   little bit too much food for our delicate UK stomachs though the locals seemed to fare betterGreat room service food and excellent staff  Concierges were superb and really did know where to go and what was what in terms of tours restaurants and places to visit   Spa worked a treat   great views and great massage   nothing too much trouble  
P => Excellent Business Hotel You come into the hotel and come up one floor to the main lobby to register  The rooms are large and very well orated with mood lights even in the bath room  The shower was one of the best Ive had and the hot water comes on right away with excellent pressure The health club is well situated in the top floor with and indoor pool  The bed was outstanding with very comfortable down comforters  Meals are a little on the high side but very well presented but with small portions  Meals are served in a beautiful lobby and a delightful place to hold a business lunch  Service in the whole hotel was excellent and lived up to the reputation of the Peninsular  It is well located opposite Saks th Ave and half a block from the main shopping street  
P => Fabulous Hotel   Absolutely Worldclass My wife and I spent  wonderful days at the Pen Chicago  It was our anniversary so we received a double upgrade one for Amex FHampR and one for the anniversary  We booked a ior suite so we ended up in a deluxe suite The room was very fresh and new looking  The furniture was in excellent condition electronics were of the highest standard Ipod ports at TVs memory card ports at TVs the usual Peninsula bedside console DVD players and a TV in the bathroom  Kudos for the free wireless The bed was comfortable with soft sheets the bathroom was large with a big shower plus a arate soaking tub and the sitting area was spacious  The soundproofing in our room was excellent and the blackout curtains made for a great sleeping environment Service was top notch  The bellmen were fast and friendly  The front desk staff accompanied us to our room and were exceedingly gracious  Housekeeping was thorough yet almost invisible  The concierge made good recommendations about dining and places to see  The hotel arranged airport transportation which was flawless Dining Shanghai Terrace is exceptional for high end Chinese I cannot adequately praise this place  Be warned it is pricey but worth it  Room service is both prompt and quite good albeit very costly  Pierrot the French cafe is ok and a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast The Bar is always crowded and if I had one complaint we had a sour waitress the one night we went down who shorted me on my scotch as I received the quotlast shotquot in the bottle  That was not an excuse for a short drink On our anniversary the hotel sent chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of French Champagne which was unexpected and very nice  This hotel delivered a product and service at an exceptional level for the United States  As a very frequent traveler this hotel is among the best I have seen in a US city  Yes it is very pricey but they deliver a top notch experience with great rooms and great service  The location cannot be beat either  
P => Loved the Peninsula Stayed here for two nights while visiting friends who live down the street  I had grown up having tea at the Peninsula in Hong Kong and wanted to check out a Peninsula in the States  It was really just awesome  Our room was in a lovely yellow and cream or on the th floor  We had a standard room so it just overlooked the Park Hyatt but you could also people watch on the Mag Mile  Speaking of which it is just outside your door  The rooms are quiet with the exception of the Chicago PD and FD who seem to really like their sirens at night Thank goodness we got a special deal on our stay because lets face it this place is expensive but just oh so wonderful  We ordered room service breakfast which came to  for two  Very yummy however and even better with the Sunday New York Times delivered to your door We also had afternoon tea included in our stay and it was just lovely  Service food atmosphere musicians  Almost like being in Kowloon itself Everyone working there was so gracious at ease at serving and interacting with guests  No snobbishness just pleasant polite attentive Lastly the pool was just really neat  Up on the st floor with a great view lovely poolside seating and a whirlpool  Plus we had the place to ourselves  
P => Quiet wonderful luxury Everything about this hotel is lovely without being obnoxiously so well ok sending up a bellhop in an all white sailor suit with white gloves to deliver a grimy fedex package was farily silly but Ill overlook that  Had the most relaxing two day hotel stay and Ill def stay here aging if only for the assurance that a pair of fresh padded slippers a plush robe and the best bath towels Ive ever encountered will be waiting for me  Also really like that they have a push button system that lares your room off limits to housekeeping until you push another button that asks for them to make up the room  
P => Completely Over rated This hotel is completely over rated  The staff was mediocre the rooms had an odd odor  Ive stayed at much nicer actual  star hotels  This was not one of them  be it works for Chicago but Id rather stay at the Four Seasons Ritz or the Park Hyatt  Really dont believe the hype  
P => Wonderful Family Trip Amid comments of why are you going to Chicago in ch I planned a short trip and booked a room at the Peninsula  My wife and I were accompanied by our two children   Our son is aged  and and our dhter is aged  months  We had never been to the Peninsula before but its reputation convinced me to stay there  I arranged through the hotel to have a car to meet us at the airport upon our arrival  Inside the terminal a man was waiting for us holding a Peninsula Hotel sign  He greeted us and led us outside to the waiting car  Our car was a black Lincoln stretch limousine  My son loved the car and the driver whisked us away from the airport for a relaxing ride to the hotel  We pulled up to the hotel which is guarded by two very large oriental lion statues  We were greeted by a very friendly doorman named Timothy  He took my name and said our bags would be delivered to our room shortly  We proceeded inside the hotel and took the elevator to the lobby to check in  We were greeted warmly as we completed our check in  The Lobby Restaurant room was near the elevators and it is just as stunning in person as in all pictures I had seen of it  The friendly woman who checked us in led us to the elevator and took us to our room on the twelfth floor  We had booked a ior suite   because we needed the space  The room was done in shades of yellow and gold  The truly great hotels always do the little things that set them apart and the Peninsula accomplished this brilliantly  On the cocktail table in front of the sofa in the living room was a paper model of a  light blue Ford Thunderbird convertible  Inside the seating compartment was a linen napkin wrapped around two chocolate chip cookies  Next to the car was a tini glass filled with gummy bears  Next to the tini glass was a small teacup and saucer and a small silver spoon  Inside the teacup was orange gelatin  There was also a beautiful purple box of Vosges Haut Chocolat exotic truffles on the desk  The room looked out onto N  Michigan Avenue and the large window made the view exceptional  The room was spacious and inviting  The next wonderful detail that the hotel accomplished still puts a smile on my face  In the closet were robes for us to wear while we relaxed  There were two adult robes and two robes for the children  The robes for the children had hoods and were sized so as to fit them each perfectly  We got some great photographs of the kids in those robes  The room was equipped with consoles by the bed that controlled all the environmental adjustments for the room  The bathroom was gorgeous and well equipped  There was a television that could be viewed while bathing in the bathtub  The kids loved watching TV while taking their evening baths  Turn down service was completed every evening much to our satisfaction  We had lunch at the french bistro connected to the hotel  The food and service were both excellent  After our visit to the observation k of the Sears Tower we returned to the hotel and had dinner at the Lobby Restaurant  This restaurant is a gorgeous palatial space  The food was wonderful as was our server Don  I enjoyed a Peninsula tini and my wife enjoyed her Blood Orange tini  After dinner we retired to our room and I slept deeply on the very comfortable bed  The next morning I watched the kids while my wife indulged in a swedish massage at the Spa  She said Donald did a great job  After that we all had breakfast in the the french bistro and headed out to see some of the culture of the city  We took the kids to the Science and Industry Museum Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago  The weather was cooperative with the temperature in the mid to upper s and mostly sunny  The Cloud Gate was fun to see in person  Upon our return to the hotel my son and I enjoyed the pool and the hot tub before we went to dinner  What a scenic setting to swim laps  I loved it  I wanted to try Chicago style pizza on our last night so I phoned the Concierge and she recommended either Ginos East or Giordanos  Since we had the kids we chose Giordanos because it was right across the street on North Rush Street  We ordered the stuffed pizza and it was incredibly good  I was raised on the thin crust pizza of New Haven Connecticut but I got to tell you the stuffed pizza here while different was every bit as enjoyable as any pizza I have ever had  After dinner we retired to our room bathed the kids and fell asleep  The next morning we had an early breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant  Again the food and service were excellent  We returned to our room and collected our luggage and proceeded to check out  I used the express checkout method and we took the elevator to the ground level  Timothy the doorman saw us off and our limousine returned us to OHare for our trip home  What a fabulous stay at the Chicago Peninsula  
P => One Word Perfection I had purchased a ticket to the closing night performance of my favourite opera at the Chicago Lyric Opera  I chose the Peninsula as I only had a one nights stay and I wanted to assure I was well taken care of  I debated back and forth with myself between the Ritz Carlton and the Peninsula and finally ided to give the Peninsula a try  Previous stays at other Ritz locations have left me feeling dizzy with the over the top attempt at opulence  With the Peninsula the mantra appeared to be quotless is morequot and I was not disappointed The hotel arranged a driver who met me at the airport with sincere smiles and an immaculate sedan featuring the Peninsulas signature magazine bottles of signature mineral water and various snacks  Upon arrival in Chicago I was treated regally from everyone from the driver to the concierge  I was shown to my room by the warm and gracious young lady who checked me in at reception Because I was only staying one night I opted for a regular king room rather than a full suite  The room was well appointed with the understated elegance for which I had hoped  Rather than showy opulance everything about the room and indeed the entire hotel boasted understated sumptuousness   everything whispered plush without screaming pretention by shoving wealth in ones face  My fifteenth floor room had a beautiful view of the Magnificent Mile  In addition to the standard amenities the room offered incredibly plush bathrobes to be enjoyed in the state of the art bathroom  The ice bucket had been filled and two bottles of the hotels signature mineral water were waiting for me upon arrival  Everything from the bedrooms plasma television to the bathrooms whirlpool tub with built in entertainment center was of the highest quality Upon return from the opera the hotel staff had performed a discreet turn down service in addition to cleaning the bathroom and refreshing the toiletries  Embroidered slippers and a clean bathrobe had been laid out for my ease  The ice bucket had again been filled and two more bottles of water were left I had chosen the full Chinese breakfast as room service and it was delivered on time and warm  The food was absolutely delicious   If you try nothing else during your stay choose the Chinese breakfast   You will not be disappointed Due to weather conditions my flight was delayed and I needed to stay an additional five hours until the car would deliver me back to the airport  The same young lady who checked me in greeted me warmly by name as I walked to the reception desk to discuss an extension for a late check out  She re arranged the driver and obtained a selection of spa services while I waited for my rescheduled flight Overall I was extremely impressed with the warmth and classic luxury of the Peninsula  Everything and everyone was the epitome of what true class is  The Ritz has just lost a customer  
P => Not my cup of tea  My family and I visited the Chicago for a few days after Christmas and for the most part we enjoyed our stay at the Peninsula Upon entering the hotel you take an elevator to get to the lobby and then another elevator to get to your room  The elevators were quick but give yourself a few extra minutes to get downstairs if ever in a hurry while staying there Our room was on the th floor and had excellent views  My family of four shared two bedrooms which were arated by a parlor that had a desk couches TV and a half bathroom  The bedrooms were average in size and d cor and generally underwhelming  The bathrooms however were fabulous  There was a television above the bathtub and ample space to get ready  The hotel supplied Molton Brown products as well as toothbrushes razors sewing and nail kits etc Beds were comfy and free bottles of water piled up after turndown My major qualm with our room was the technology  I was under the impression that everything would be very high tech and sleek and it just wasn t  The bulky control centers were confusing and outdated  And the plasma TV and DVD players I thought I was getting were clunky and old  I think its time for an upgrade The service was mediocre at best  While everybody was polite I felt as if the Peninsula s employees were only greeting me because it was their job to do so not because they cared about me  Several times I had to be the person who initiated the  hello  or  good morning   I don t expect to be waited on hand and foot but the occasional feeling that the concierge or front desk or dining room servers were happy to see me would have been nice In terms of hotel food the room service was average  My family ordered some snacks one day and nothing was exceptional  Breakfast at Avenues was delicious but nothing I couldn t get at any other fine hotel  I do not recommend tea  The tea was ok but the food was horrible  I don t think I enjoyed a single thing and there was plenty to choose from The thing that I liked best about the hotel was its location  All of Chicago s highlights including the shops on Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier are just a walk away  There s plenty to do see buy and eat and no need for a taxi or rental car to get there I absolutely love Chicago and its hard to fault the Peninsula for making my time less fun filled because it most certainly was  However next time I ll opt to stay at the Drake or the W Lakeshore where I can get a little more bang for my buck and a little personality  
P => i would stay here again the hotel was great  the room was great  the food was great  the pool was great  the service was great  i would stay here again  
P => Excellent hotel with great food I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for two nights in ober  while on business  Had a room on the th Floor with views of the Water Works  Everything about this property was wonderful  The lobby and conference areas were beautiful and put together really well to host a large event with multiple meetings  The quality and selection of food made attending meetings a real treat and room service salads and burgers at least were great  Now for the room it was huge The bathroom had its own couch Excellent desk and business set up with extremely comfortable bed  I dont even think I used every piece of furniture in the room it was so big Cant beat the location either   youre literally steps away from Michigan Avenue shopping and world famous pizza  
P => Best Hotel EVER We live in Chicago and when we need a little pampering and to just get away  we head to the Peninsula  It is truly an amazing experience and worth every penny The rooms are so comfortable and the contemporary design is clean and calming The staff goes above and beyond every step of the way  Its smack dab in the middle of all the action in the city so you are close to everything You cannot go wrong here   book your stay today 
P => Close but no cigar at the Peninsula Chicago I stayed here for a week while in town visiting family and friends  Ive stayed at  of the  Peninsula locations and although this is certainly one of the more luxurious properties they have the service lags behind the other locations Now by no means is the service quotbadquot just not up to par with its sister hotels  At the other Peninsula locations I would consider the service relative to other hotels not just the Peninsula Chicago above and beyond over the top and sublime  At the Peninsula Chicago I would consider the service as above average For instance at other Peninsula locations they welcome you with a welcome drink in the room and possibly a light snack  No such greeting at the Chicago Peninsula At other Peninsula locations when the Spa was booked the receptionist offered to either call me if there were any cancellations and even recommended some local Spas   not at the Peninsula Chicago The rooms are great the location couldnt be better and the restaurants are top notch  My friends that live in the neighborhood all love The Bar at the Peninsula as well as the Chocolate Bar they have every Friday and Saturday Its a wonderful hotel    the service just isnt over the top as Ive come to expect having stayed at most of their other properties The hotel accommodations are important but not as much as customer service  At the  star level one expects a high level of customer service  The Peninsula Chicagos customer service is attentive at best mildly impersonal at worst The Park Hyatt next door isnt quite as luxurious a little too contemporary for my taste however their service was surprisingly helpful  If location and a high level of customer service is all you desire you  want to look into the Park Hyatt Chicago for shorter trips I know I will  
P => Excellent Fabulous  We stayed with our two toddlers at the last minute for one night due to an airline mishap  Our son has severe food allergies and they were very accommodating of his needs  The service was excellent the food was excellent the rooms are delightful and the bed is exceedingly comfortable  Expensive but definitely an example of you get what you pay for  
P => Stay in Style Stayed on a corporate rate for business  I was impressed with everything the hotel had to offer especially the pool  The crowd was a little old for my tast   looked like a lot of bankers  I did enjoy watching the working girls pick up on them in the lobby bar  
P => Not as good as the first one but still luxorious    What a great place  I have been to the Peninsula in Hong Kong and while it is not as nice it still is grand for Chicago  A great location on North Michigan Avenue and the rooms are brand new and spacious  The pool is gorgeous and the afternoon tea in the lobby is quite good as well  
P => A very good choice I wanted to stay in what I hoped was the best hotel in town and so my expectations were high The Peninsula did not disappoint My room was a kingsize deluxe and although it overlooked another building on a side street it was very quiet unless you open the windows and well appointed  The staff were all very helpful efficient and courteous  The spa is very well designed with a nice indoor pool  The outdoor sunk enabled some sunbathing and room service could be ordered there The massages in the spa were good but the standard varied I had three different therapists and one was considerably better than the other two For  dollars for sixty minutes I would have liked more consistency  The location of the hotel is excellent   right by Michigan Avenue  I would recommend Peirrot Gourmet for breakfast which is quite casual  It is part of the hotel so you can charge to your bill but is accessed from the street by the hotel so is very close by but gives the feeling of being out of the hotel  
P => Great  We stayed here for a long weekend in e and had a great time  The accommodations are first class the location is stellar and the staff is top notch  You get exactly what you pay for  Our room was very large the beds were very comfy and the location is right off of Michigan Ave  so everything we did was walking distance away  We even cht the train to Wrigley amp the airport so I think we only took one cab    which was to the hotel  
P => A Hotel The Peninsula is everything a  star hotel should be  The staff is professional poised and very helpful  The rooms are well appointed the counsel next to the bed is unique and fabulous  We finally found a hotel bed thats MORE comfortable than ours at home not an easy task The spa is beautiful  Although we didnt have treatments we enjoyed the facilies workout room steam room pool hot tub outdoor patio  The spa had very thoughtful touches throughout   e g  swim diapers for kids various flavored water and tea plush towels   all terrific Avenues one of the three restaurants  Oh my  Fantastic food unbelievably creative delicious  The service was terrific  HOWEVER the portions are pathetic  For  for two we should not leave hungry  The waitress explains that each course is   bites  So the four course is  bites for   And she was right  The  course is   One should not have to select the  course to fill their stomach  I understand that the new chef cut the portions which is a terrible mistake  I would go back in a heartbeat if the portions doubled  We have been to several other top Chicago restaurants Tru Trotters Les Nomades Everest Moto and we have never experienced anything like these miniscule portions Overall our experience at the Peninsula was wonderful and I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Nice Room except for the Mold We booked a room and were upgraded to a suite rm   However the suite was located on the th floor right below the pool and locker rooms  During the night my wife who suffers from allergies and asthma woke up with terrible pain in her sinuses  We struggled to sleep for the rest of the night  In the morning she had a nosebleed In the morning we noticed paint quotbubblesquot on the wall near the ceiling in the living room  When I reached up and touched the bubbles they were wet and slimy  Upon further inspection it was clear that there had been a number of quotrepairsquot in the past but the problem had never been solved When we complained about this to the management he acted very honorably  He explained that room was right below the locker rooms in the pool  spa area and there must have been a leak  He comped the room for the night and offered to move us to another room in the hotel However the lost night of sleep really wrecked our vacation  We ided that if one room has mold we couldnt trust any other room and found accommodations elsewhere  
P => What  Star Should Be Everything aspect of our stay from start to finish was excellent  The hotel is immaculate rooms are a nice size well appointed and quiet  Staff are really helpful and the concierges I worked with were  real  concierges they were happy to answer questions make bookings and their advice on Chicago was very good  Front desk staff was helpful honest and friendly  Gym is beautifully equipped with plenty of machines and an excellent classstretching room all with big windows  Pool is a full  meters with windows right down to the floor a great place for a swim Apples and coffee to go at the gym and pool were a very nice touch in the morning I travel over   of the time and a hotel like this stands out for the comprehensive high quality of all services and facilities offered  Ill certainly stay here again when Im in Chicago  
P => The Absolute Standard This hotel is the standard by which ALL hotels should be judged not just Chicago but anywhere  It is first class in every way from the doormen to the bellhop to the front desk staff to the housekeeping The location is perfect for downtown shopping and sightseeing  The rooms are gorgeous  The food was outstanding  I did not visit the spa but heard only great things Obviously it is expensive but this is the pinnacle of hotels  
P => Romance at the Peninsula Flawless Nothing more can be said  Service was excellent the food was awesome and the location is amazing Situated atop Tiffanys on Michigan does it get any better its in the middle of everything  The staff is very helpful  Of course it all comes at a pretty penny but the suite is worth it   with a plasma in the bathtub press button EVERYTHING floor to ceiling windows its exquisite  
P => Almost perfect I stayed one night on a business trip  The room was fine the bathroom exceptional  I love the way a light comes on in the closet when you open the closet door  The staff was friendly and repeatedly offered to help  I have two relatively minor quibbles I had to search the room for a water glass to brush my teeth  I finally found one in the bedroom with the water bottle  A slip up by the staff Secondly I like to have a cup of coffee in the morning without ordering it through room service  There was no coffee maker in the room  I noted when checking out though that coffee urns and paper cups were in the lobby   
P => great hotel best in chicago I stayed  nights in the Peninsula and had again a great peninsula experience  Last time in stayed in Four seasons and the Peninsula just has that little bit extra  Chocolates in your room great breakfast friendly staff and a very classy lobby  I had dinner in their gourmet restaurant the second night   us for a single couvert including wine and digestive  Not cheap but the best culinair experience I had so far in the US  They have a new chef so check it out  Especially the wagyu with cocos is heavenly  Peninsula done manila and chicago cant wait to experience the other seven 
P => Id Give It Six Stars If I Could This was one of the best hotel stays of my life from start to finish  be THE best urban hotel experience  Every need was anticipated and there was a thoughtful touch at every turn  I spent Easter weekend in Chicago and stayed at both the Four Seasons and the Peninsula and though the S was nice and thoroughly professional it paled next to the Peninsula My stay here was starting off well anyway since I had gotten a special holiday rate of night  Thats practically unheard of for this hotel  Despite the low rate I was still upgraded to a premium view room on check in with a direct view of the water tower and the Hancock Tower  The rooms are wonderfully plush with closet and drawer space set in a vestibule outside the bathroom so that theres room for a full sofa even in the standard rooms  Bedding is tops and though the color scheme is still priily beige there are nice colorful touches in the textiles  Of course youve probably read about all the high tech gizmos and how practically everything is controlled by a button  Except oddly enough the curtains which are still pullcord operated  That and the fact that the hotel really needs to upgrade to flat screen TVs would be my only small quibbles   The bathrooms are glorious with deep soaking tubs easy to operate fixtures with great temperature control and the TVradio operated from a tubside control  I was checked in by a professional warm staffer who handed me confirmed restaurant reservations  even though I had booked them through OpenTable there must be some sort of name cross checking  I then got a personal tour of the room including its electronics The Lobby is a huge beautiful space with tall columns and an airy feel  Its Art o with Asian touches  Lunch service there was flawless the menu is fairly standard for this sort of place though they do have purple sweet potato fries  I also went back for the weekend evening chocolate fantasy  At  its a bit of indulgence since you can really only eat so much chocolate late at night without making yourself sick  However its a nifty signature offering and just the selection of offerings is fun plus they were all tasty  Just off the bright lobby is the bar which is a totally different environment  dark and moody with sofa seating as well as the bar itself  Again attentive service and nice selection  I also had dinner at Shanghai Terrace where I was again pampered beyond belief and found the food delicious  I was there at opening so had the place almost to myself for a while  Its not cheap but  per person including appetizer soup course  lobster mmm  entree dessert two cocktails and tip certainly isnt outrageous  The top floor pool here is a nice amenity  Always plenty of seating and the floor to ceiling views over the neighboring buildings certainly make it an unusual setting and experience  Just know that there are usually children there and with the hard surfaces its not a quiet and relaxing place  The spa certainly is though  In short if you can handle the cost for when youre staying you cant do any better in Chicago  The hotel sits dead center of the Miracle Mile and the Chicago subway stop is about a  minute walk away  Its less than ten minutes to the theatre district door to door  
P => Good not great    We stayed for  nights last month in a deluxe double room  Overall Id have to rate the hotel as just ok and not on the same level as the other Peninsula hotels weve visited Our check in experience was inexcusable for a hotel of this reputation and star rating  A week before our arrival the hotel contacted me regarding our arrival time pm number in our family names ages etc    When we arrived the woman that checked us in was less than friendly much less and informed us that our room wasnt ready  She also asked how many people would be staying in the room eventhough I clarified that before our arrival  I asked if it would be possible to pay for an upgraded room that was currently available but she waved me off saying quotno nothings availablequot and that shell call my cell when the room is ready  By the way I knew for a fact that the hotel had a very low occupancy at the time and that rooms of all categories were indeed available  She didnt bother to even estimate when the room would be ready or direct us to a place to wait  We myself and  children then wandered the hotel looking for an open restaurant it was  degrees outside and I didnt feel like bundling the kids back up and walking around  It was a Sunday and there was literally ONE place serving in the hotel which was the lobby lounge  We asked the hosted to be seated at one of the empty tables but she insisted that they were reserved and nothing would be available for half an hour  I then asked if there were ANYPLACE in the hotel where we could wait and the hostess rudely pointed to her left and said quotbe over therequot  After over an hour of waiting quotover therequot I finally gave up on being seated in the lobby and approached the front desk again  It was a different agent this time a very friendly gentleman and I asked the status of our room  He responded that our room was indeed and had been ready for some time and apologized that I had not be notified    This wasted hour and a half was certainly not a huge deal but also certainly not something that should have happened at The Peninsula  The room was fine if a bit outdated and clean  With the exception of the bathrooms there was nothing exceptional about the space  The carpet was in need of replacement and Id cetainly hesitate to pay the rack rate of  a nightThe majority of our stay was without incident and I encountered many employees that were extremely curtious and helpful  However I do believe that our next stay in Chicago will be at either the Ritz or Four Seasons  
P => Still great but needs an update I have now stayed at the Peninsula Chicago  times since the year   I stay here for many reasons including location exceptional service and spaworkout facilities  The staff is incredibily courteous  The bathrooms are spectacular with arate garden tubs and showers along with ble accents  The TV above the bathtub is the bomb The workout area and swimming pool sits on the th floor overlooking Michigan avenue and is spectacular  While the Peninsula has never failed in the area of exceptional service I now feel that this hotel is overdue for an upgrade  Considering the fact that the cheapest rooms run over night there are some areas that need attention  First of all the carpeting in the rooms is in dire need of replacing  I have stayed in  different levels of rooms over the past six years and they all seem to have the original carpeting  My latest stay was no different and the carpeting in the room had some stains and showed a lot of wear and tear  Secondly they need to upgrade to flat screen televisions  The current TVquots are housed in an armoire that is to the side of the bed and provides for awkward viewing  While the overall room or is very nice it is starting to look a little dated  While I will continue to stay at the Peninsula I believe there  be other options in Chicago worth exploring at this price  Once the rooms are upgraded though I think the Peninsula will again be the best place to stay downtown  
P =>  hours of perfection Wow best hotel Ive ever stayed in bar none  The service is of a caliber that is beyond words  All the reviews pretty much lay out all the details so no need to repeat all of the wonderful amenities okay I will anyway    molton brown bath products TV in bathroom oversized bathtub and arate oversized shower temp controls in wall sound system amazing bed to name a few  We were there for my th birthday and were upgraded to a nicer room without us asking and they sent up a bottle of champagne and strawberries w fresh whipped cream on the house  They also sent up an additional dessert plate with truffles and raspberries  Best nights sleep of my life on what must have been  thread count sheets and a perfect weight duvet  The spa is unbelievable    the nicest Ive ever been to and Ive been to my share of spas  Unlimited supply of towels sandals cucumber water amazing steam room the best  minute massage Ive ever had everything was so clean and beautiful  Tiny snag at breakfast in the hotel restaurant    we came down at  after having called down at  to ask about breakfast options and we were met with  hour wait  But I simply told the concierge that we had to be somewhere at  the massage and that we needed to be seated now or I wouldnt be able to really eat breakfast without feeling nauseous during the massage and they figured out a way to seat us right away  Had a perfect breakfast and we watched them as they set up the sunday brunch and that looked just over the top amazing  I wasnt sorry to miss it though since I had just had  of the most delicious cups of coffee ever perfectly cooked eggs and a bowl of really wonderful museli with cream and blackberries  We were granted a late checkout pm with no trouble  Ive just never met that level of service in my life  I could go on forever about this place  If I could ever afford it I would stay there every chance I get Also  we ate at Shanghai Terrace for dinner    appetizers were outstanding entrees and dessert were just okay in comparison but the atmosphere and service were   perfect so Id recommend it for sure  
P => An oasis from the cold Although it would be difficult to find fault with this property I am a nitpicker and like to look at both sides of the coin  So first the positive attributes which are abundant     the hotel is beautifully laid out the staff is aware of every minute detail the rooms are exceptional by any standard the linens are first rate the bedside panel is delightful the in room DVD player a nice touch the bathroom incredible Within the mammoth bathroom is a large walk in shower two sinks a frosted glass enclosed WC and a huge tub  The ONLY two things I could find wrong were the fact that the restaurants are closed on Sunday and Monday   something I dont understand when dealing with a world class hotel and that the doorman was nowhere in sight when we needed to brave the   degree cold and wind to find a taxi to our restaurant  However a bellman who to his credit was not dressed at all for the biting weather came to our aid  I would most certainly stay here again    if I could afford it 
P => Perfection My husband and I stayed here for  nights with our  dhters  The room was exceptional   loved the outdoor temperature reading right by the unit door the wall controls for all the lighting next to the beds the tv in the bathroom and the sound system  The beds were so cozy the welcome amenities for the children were delightful and the furnishings in the room lovely As someone who hates indoor pools I found this indoor pool in a category all its own  It was beautiful the furniture comfy and the wall of windows overlooking Michigan Avenue was unbelievable  We spent hours there and I still didnt want to leave  My husband treated himself to a massage which he was very pleased with  We did eat in the Shanghai Terrace which was not great with kids  I highly recommend this hotel  The service or and pool are impeccable  It is my favorite hotel ever     
P => Perfection I stayed in a br executive suite  I think this hotel is slightly better than the Chicago Four Seasons  They are both very similar new hotels located in an office tower  Great location and terrific service  I will come back  
P => Another World of Luxury My wife and I stayed here for my birthday and let me tell you it truly is a different world of luxury  Upon check in we were upgraded to an Executive Suite without asking that had a living room HUGE bathroom and a king sized bed overlooking the Water Tower  Also had some dried amp fresh fruits as well as a box of Vosges Chocolate Truffles waiting in the room for us  Oh the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub with a TV in the wall While we didnt eat at the hotel we went to Gibsons we did grab some pastries amp coffee from the French bistro on the st floor for breakfast that were perfect  Obscenely expensive but an experience well remember forever  Well worth itp s  The shampoolotion they provide is from Molton Brown which you should try your hardest to use all of its fantastic stuff 
P => Great I honestly have no idea what people here are complaining about  This  be the single nicest domestic hotel in which Ive stayed   and I spend a lot of time in hotels  Check in was quick and efficient  The room was    wonderful  It had every convenience I could imagine  Large bathroom with arate tub and shower  Can watch TV or listen to the radio while soaking in the tub In room stereo  Great lighting  Free easy wireless internet  Comfy deskchair and sofa  Can see TV from anywhere in the main room  Terrycloth bathrobe and slippers  Free bottled water in the evening  Really I cant imagine anything that was left undone or anything more that Id want No room noise  Never any wait for elevators  The hotel is within walking distance from many stores and restaurants  They offer you a choice of  newspapers    I asked for  and got a third Concierge was great    wonderful recommendation for sushi restaurant I had a minor issue with the mini bar which wasnt cold  I called the front desk  Literally within five minutes I had room service at my door bringing two of what Id wanted    on the house  They replaced the fridge while I was at dinner  Impeccable service Didnt try the spa    unfortunately   so no comments on that The hotel bar was fun    but they do allow cigar smoking so beware  You can take drinks up to your room  Room service was timely although the food was only average especially for the price  Fooddrink prices are high for Chicago but as noted there are many great places to eat nearby This is a great hotel with great service  Absolutely recommend it Cant wait to return to Chicago to stay here again  
P => The Best WOW I m not sure that there are enough superlatives in my vocabulary to completely describe my experience at The Peninsula  The only downside is that this hotel will possibly ruin you for all lesser offerings My wife and I moved here for one night after spending two nights across the street at the Ritz Carlton  The desk staff at the Peninsula was accommodating was able to get us assigned a room at the early time of  AM even though we were visiting on a very busy weekend  This was a nice surprise to begin our stay  The friendly clerk then walked us to our room introduced us to the many features of the room and verified that everything was to our satisfaction  I found the level of service throughout the hotel to be exceptional  Every employee that I came into contact with was polite and helpful The room was very nice  We had reserved basic room and found it to be quite comfortable and spacious  The earth toned d cor is elegant without being overwhelming  The bed and linens are just wonderful and it can be hard to coax yourself out of bed in the morning  The fact that you can control all of the electrical for your room from a bedside panel was a feature that I had never before experienced and I just loved it The bathroom was also large and well appointed  A two person soaking tub with a television perched above was on the far wall  Another control panel for the lights radio television and phone are within easy reach  The tub s speakerphone even neutralizes the sound of the water so that a caller does not hear that you are calling from the tub The bathroom which is all finished in ble and frosted glass also includes a large shower and other necessary facilities  The room also contains a fair sized closet electronic safe personal fax machine DVD Player and well stocked mini bar  The th and  floors are where the pool and spa are located  We found these areas to also be very nice  Most of the common areas were stocked with chilled bottled water and the lobby had a coffee bar set up in the AM hours  The hotel bar is a warm inviting place to have a drink  However it can get quite crowded If there are any negatives to mention I would say that the selection of soaps in the room could have been better  Also parking  will break you if you bring an auto but I guess that is pretty standard for downtown Chicago In conclusion this place is just the best At least the best I have ever stayed in  the Peninsula has a great location right on North Michigan a warm friendly staff and very comfortable rooms  What else can you ask for 
P => Loved the hotel This was my first trip to Chicago and my first stay at a Peninsula hotel  The room and the staff were both great  I plan to stay at other Peninsula hotels in the future  
P => wonderful High class hotel with large rooms and huge bathrooms  Luxurious bathrooms especially  Great rooftop pool  
P => Good   but not great I recently stayed two nights at an Executive Suite at the Peninsula  I almost always like to stay at Four Seasons properties when I travel I had never been to Chicago and so I was really torn but based on the reviews here and wanting to try something new I chose the Peninsula  Arrival went smoothly  Our rental car was met promptly and courteously and the bellhop was quick and very pleasant  Check in was fine although the reception was a bit chilly not the welcoming Four Seasons experience I am accustomed to  In addition the entire lobby which includes a very large and lovely lobby bar as well as a arate room containing a darker more traditional bar reeked of cigarcigarette smoke  This was not a promising start  I too went in with pretty high expectations of the room  For  a night I expect something pretty special  But the first impression of the room an executive suite with three way directional views left me flat  It was fine but there was no wow factor  The wall mounted flat screen TV in the living room was nice the TV at the foot of the bathtub is cool sorta but I wasnt overwhelmed  The drapes were not automated which was annoying  The room was cold and when I went to turn on the heat I found baseboard heaters which did not work in the bedroom and in the living room reeked of something burning  We called down to the front desk and asked for the problem to be fixed while we went out to dinner at Topolobampo which was FABULOUS When we returned we did not know if a technician had been to the room  The burning smell was gone but the heaters in the bedroom which is arated from the living room by a long hallway and the bathroom were still not working  I called down to the front and a technician came up promptly and explained that he had thought he had fixed the problem  He puttered around then left again saying he would try something else  He never returned and the heaters never worked in the bedroom for the duration of our stay  The small service missteps continued  I had asked for daily delivery of the Trib but got the NY Times both days  I couldnt get the TV in the living room to work and felt like an idiot but then even the technician couldnt get it to work and that required some work before it was operational  Room service for breakfast was prompt but the coffee and pastries werent very good  We ventured into the bar briefly but the incredibly stiffling smoke drove us out  I dreaded walking through the lobby because the smell prevades the entire floor  For a hotel of this caliber this is really unacceptable  The second night we took advantage of the house car a lovely black Lexus with driver provided free to guests when available to go within a  mile radius  It was a nice change from the rather harrowing cab ride experiences  Our room came with the acclaimed Hastings bed which was indeed fabulous  The towels and bathrobes while roomy were not very soft  The amenities in the bathroom were fine and as expected bath products hair dryer dental product sewing kit slippers  The room is very quiet and effectively blocks most of the city noise and we never heard anything from other guests or rooms  We had a rather packed schedule and did not get up to the spapool area  The hotel itself is located within easy walking distance of the Art Instititue Millenium Park and some very nice shopping  If I return to Chicago I would not return to the Peninsula  
P => Still my favorite hotel in Chicago I had a very pleasant three night stay at the Peninsula Chicago in late il   My room was a grand deluxe king on the top floor of the hotel  This was my third stay   my previous two stays had been in an Executive Suite and a ior Suite As with each stay the check in was flawless   I was on my way to my room within a couple minutes  The front desk asked if I had dinner plans and when I told them I was interested in eating at the Shanghai Terrace one of the on site restaurants they called right away and made reservations for me The room was very comfortable  There was terrific lighting and the desk was more than suitable for business  The couch in the room was also comfortable and had excellent lighting for reading  The linens were first rate  Everything in the room was in excellent condition The bathroom is very similar to the bathrooms in the suites except that there is only one sink not two  Otherwise the arate shower and tub were identical to the ones in the suites  I note that the tub has a built in TV at its foot with waterproof controls next to the tub   this feature contributed to my son on a prior trip describing the hotel as his favorite of all time All aspects of the service were at Peninsula levels   superb I went into this stay with the Peninsula being my favorite hotel in Chicago and I left the stay with no reason to change my mind  I ll be back  
P => Really great  Lots of perks Great location  Next to water tower which is great for taking the free trolley or the bus  Rooms are very clean crisp  There is a small crack on top of the bath but who cares Large rooms with arate corridor for luggage amp wardrobe so you are not cramped in like with most hotels  Bathroom has a shower recess with  showerheads one fixed and one portable  Bathtub also has a showerhead  TV in the bathroom  Free slippers internet which I am using now to write this review Molton Brown lotionsshampoos and bottled water which are all very handy  Pet friendly seen a dog in the lobby  Highly recommended    Did I mention the powdermakeup area in the bathroom as well 
P => Afive star hotel in a great location Our recent stay at the Peninsula Hotel in Chicago for a business meeting was great with only positive comments The hotel is actually large with over  rooms but we never felt anonymous or as one of the masses  The placement of the reception area on the second floor gives it a sense of privacy and there was always that rarefied and discreet feel throughout   in the elevators the hallways in the Lounge restaurant etc   Service was excellent all around attentive anticipatory polite and very accommodating  At check out with  people ahead of us an additional staff member promptly appeared to help quotmove things alongquot  For what I think was a fairly standard double room we had a view of the Water Tower the bed was really really comfortable all bed and bath linens were squeaky clean and fluffy but the star was the brilliantly spacious bathroom with ble tiled arate shower a granite vanity tons of strategically glass doorspartitions and Molton Brown bath products  We agree with one of the previous reviewers that the room or is neither designer trendy nor overly rich but we ourselves didnt mind the understated and unfussy furnishings after being overly stimulated all day with work related stuff  We ate at the hotel restaurant Avenues and found the inative cuisine to be lots of fun lavender crusted squabs heirloom beet salads with citrus segments and lambs tongue baby greens etc  The hotel is on East Superior between N  Michigan and Rush with all kinds of interesting galleries boutiques and luxury brand shops nearby away from Michigan Ave  and along smaller tree lined streets  At the same time it is quite easy to get back to the Loop    approx   mins  by cabs and about   dollars to get to Orchestra Hall the Art Institute We have previously stayed at the InterContinental which we thought was nice but not on the same level and at the Fairmont which was very nice but the location of the Fairmont was a little more awkward in relations to shops etc There is a spa on the top floor which we didnt have a chance to see or use  
P => rude and unprofessional service at the Spa at the Peninsula We stay at the best five star hotels all over the world  We really love the Four Seasons for their consistent service  We live in Chicago and travel often  I booked a spa appointment at the Peninsula spa in Chicago although we have stayed more often at the Park Hyatt and love it   better service and great room up to date rooms My husband booked my spa appointment as a gift which I was excited about and received an excellent treatment but the spa manager was rude and hung up on me when I asked her a simple question  Her name is Tiffany Craig  I would never book another appointment or stay at the Peninsula Chicago again under the circumstances  If this person represents the Peninsula style I guess no one I know would be interested in staying at the Peninsula Chicago  My grandfather and myfamily were frequent guests for many years at the Peninsula Hong Kong Unfortunately those days are now over  
P =>  Handicapped room   Great stay There are lots of reviews of this hotel which is why I ided to stay there but I thought I would review the quothandicappedquot room we got when we booked a couple of days before and were given almost the last available room in the place  Obviously they like to save it for people in wheelchairs or with disabilities  Perhaps others  like to know what to expect from these rooms at the Peninsula Because of delays we landed in a snowstorm we arrived at the hotel after midnight but were greeted pleasantly  If I had wanted someone would have taken our bags up to the room but I liked that no one insisted  There were no stairs to negotiate in or out of the hotel  The entrance is on the ground floor but then you take an elevator to the lobby floor Our room was large and comfortable with room for a wheelchair to go around the beds through the doorways and into the bathroom  The bathroom was designed for wheelchair use and all the storage except for the closet was at wheelchair accessible levels  On a side note the Chinese restaurant at the hotel gave me one of the two best Chinese meals I have experienced in my life   the other was Hakkasan in London a few years ago   and I am a Chinese food aficionado  I was not surprised when I made inquiries and found that the chefs in both cases came from great hotels in Singapore Raffles and the Mandarin Oriental respectively  The Peninsula is perfectly located and I will certainly try to stay there whenever I go back to Chicago  
P => Absolute best ever I swear this is the best hotel in Chicago  Nowhere else will you be treated with such kindness and respect The attention to detail is superb  My husband and I stayed here over the th of y weekend in  and it was awesome I had breakfast in bed the next morning while my husband went swimming  It was sooooo good This is definitely worth the price and it is a treat to stay here  They will go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable for you as they can  And they do everything for you     We were in awe when they asked us what newspaper we would like in the morning       
P => Well Worth It My ten year old and I recently returned from the Peninsula  When making my reservation the hotel inquired if they should note a special occasion for our trip  I told them we were celebrating a childs birthday Much fuss was made of this  A Peninsula Bear gummy bears chocolate chip cookies and special bath treats were delivered to our room  My child felt very special for all the attention while the surprises lent a festive air to the day We enjoyed the pool frequently  The lanes made for perfect lap swim while children enjoyed themselves in another corner of the pool  Coffee tea ice water and fresh fruit are there for guests to enjoy Check in and check out were swift  Our room was ready when we arrived before noon  Concierges Gary and Robert went out of their way to help us secure reservations and make recommendations The property is beautiful  Our Grand Deluxe room was well designed while common areas are luxurious and comfortablejust right for the two of us but would have been crowded for a family of four  Room service comes at a price at any hotel  Here it was speedy with quality food and a lovely table  Like so many things at this hotel room service was attended to in great detail  It felt like a treat rather than just a convenience  Where else would I be asked if I prefer milk for my coffee to be warmed or served coldThe tariff is dear no getting around that  I felt that for a special occassion such as ours the value was there in the grandness of the hotel the superior service and the staff who were friendly and helpful  The Peninsula staff is hardworking but they always appear to be cheerful  It makes for a pleasant atmosphere Thank you to all Tripadvisors who reviewed this property for good or not so great  These and other Chicago reviews helped me to select a property  
P => A very nice stay at the Peninsula We stayed at the Peninsula Chicago in uary for a weekend with our   year old dhter  We were booked into the lowest ranking room a superior with a king sized bed  Although there wasnt much of a view we looked onto another highrise the room itself was wonderful The orfurnishings were unblemished and that bathtub was pretty neat with the TV  The only weird thing the toilet is enclosed by frosted glass walls within the bathroom  Not a big deal but as our little girl gets older that could easily become an annoying privacy issue Speaking of kiddie stuff the crib that they supplied was adorable   linens for a little girl bath supplies a stuffed peninsula bear  Very cute   she loved it  The downstairs restaurant supplied me with complimentary milk each evening to take back to the room for her The manager also arranged for a complimentary bottle of champagne and a trio of chocolate desserts upon arrival into our room   aside from attending a family wedding we were celebrating my husbands birthday and they certainly made a nice effort towards making it special The indoor poolspa is nice  although a bit chilly We didnt have spa appointments but the public area of the spa has been newly reorated and looked great Other things to note this is downtown Chicago so if you are renting a car be prepared to pay for parking  I think it was just over  at the Peninsula for valet per night  Drive in and drive out priviledges included  Also there is a chocolate buffet each evening on the weekends   make sure to get reservations if youre interested in going Overall we loved the Peninsula and wouldnt hesistate in returning  
P => Exceeded expectations We stayed for my birthday last weekend  The room special included lunchtea in the atrium  It was such a nice way to start the day off right  My husband mentioned that it was my birthday and the manager arranged to send up a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of beautiful birthday chocolates  The staff could not have been more accomodating  The only advice I would give would be to make sure you get a room with a bath tub  It is very luxurious and there is a television right above it  The orations are very tasteful and elegant  I want to make this an annual adventure  
P => Good but not a top ten in America    We are both in our s and have stayed in very nice resorts both internationally and domestic four seasons etcMy honest opinion being a native to Chicago is the hotel is of course beautiful but overall just OK This hotel is a quottop tenquot in every list but no WOW factor at all The room is very nice and good bathroom not much better than a deluxe hyattThe tea service was OKquot You expect perfect service food attention and overall it was nothing better than a ent lunch The peninsula bar is a great place to enjoy a scotch cigar champagne We once had our privacy please on and were in the shower when housekeeping came in  I called down and asked why they did not look at the sign  They really had no response  Half the time you call concierge they forward you on somewhere else At four seasons you can ask any staff member for something and he will personally call the right people and call you back Nothing wrong with this place but   a night lets get something clear   it might not be worth it The pool rd time there in  years is not beatiful and again no wow factor  Small hot tub and the spa reation makes no sense  
P => Excellent Stayed in a Juior Suite with my three kids in early ember four day weekend  Beautiful suite if a bit small for four people  The much praised bathroom was a hit with the kids they spent most of the first hour watching TV in the tub but I found it a little cramped and the slight lack of privacy for the toilet was a bit of a pain for the four of us Kids liked the high tech room but I couldn t get the thermostat to keep the room cool enough without being too cold  The bed was very comfortable  Wireless internet unlike I think the Ritz Location just off Michigan Avenue was nice but views were plain  A nice look at the Walgreensresidential tower across the street  A sliver of beach amp waves available  Too low to see far but couldn t watch the street traffic because our room was set back Excellent service mostly  On the second night they hadn t brought our rollaway when we returned around  and we had to wait almost  minutes for it to be setup  Excellent room service everyone liked their food  Shanghai Terrace was great for lunch  Nice fitness center and pool though the hot tub was too hot    another guest agreed  Great free snacks for kids Price was comparable to a Ritz or Four Seasons suite though I think perhaps a bit smaller without as nice a view  Overall I think I slightly prefer the Ritz but the kids liked the Peninsula better and I won t veto if I get outvoted  
P => Maximum comfort minimum headache Spent  nights with my family of  including  children ages  to  and all I can say is wow  My husband and I are well traveled New Yorkers and we were impressed with just about every part of the experience  The only hotels that come close in our experience are the Oberois we stayed in in India  The Peninsula offered prompt courteous professional and highly competent service throughout in a serene and elegant setting  We would stay there again in a heartbeat When we arrived we found wed been upgraded to the Topaz Suite and it was stunning  Quiet immaculate tastefully orated with a kitchenette dining area big enough for all of us lovely bathrooms etc  There were fresh orchid and other flower arrangements in every room  Complimentary champagne chocolates and other treats for the kids were very much appreciated  And the rooms had wonderful views of the water tower lake and Michigan Avenue  The concierge and front desk were extremely helpful  We were allowed a late checkout at pm which was great Room service was excellent always arriving within  minutes and the food was fantastic  I mean really really good  We also enjoyed the Chinese restaurant downstairs  Not your ordinary Chinese restaurant the food seemed more interesting and authentic than the usual fare The only thing that was even close to a disappointment was the lobby restaurant  The chocolate buffet was probably not worth the cost unless you take the live music into account which on the night we were there was an excellent small jazz group with a fantastic vocalist  Might have been better to just have a drink and skip the buffet At the other end of the spectrum was the Sunday brunch buffet  This was truly outstanding with more choices of foods of the highest caliber than Ive ever seen at a Sunday brunch  This was one of the high points of our stay The kids loved the pool and hot tub  My husband and I fell in love with the fitness center  Im partial to working out if not outdoors then in a room with big windows and the fitness center really delivered with excellent machines facing huge windows on the th floor  The location of the hotel is great as well  Wed definitely go back but be next time for a romantic weekend by ourselves       
P => Smooth operators Stayed at the Peninsula for two nights Saturday and Sunday while in Chicago for a wedding held at the Peninsula  As wedding guests we received a discounted rate for our room and Im not sure to which room category it belonged  We had two king beds The Peninsula reminded me of a well oiled machine like a luxury car  The place is big enough to feel anonymous but the service is excellent when you need it to be  The check in staff at the Front Desk disappointed knew nothing about the wedding could not tell us about a scheduled bus journey for wedding guests leaving from the hotel etc but everyone else from housekeeping to bell staff to the doormen were friendly and efficient  Smooth is the word that kept coming to mind The or is bland but restful  My partner found the room control system varying degrees of light heat and entertainment at your fingertips by the bedside to be confusing  If youre not technically inclined ask the bell person who brings your luggage up to show you how to work the lights  For the rest of us its pretty neat  I liked being able to darken the bedroom while keeping the entryway slightly lit for my partner the night I went to bed early  The ambiance lighting worked a treat Bathroom was fantastic as per everyone elses review  And ours didnt even have a window so no view from the bathtub  It was still one of the best hotel bathrooms Ive seen    arate stand up shower from a huge soaking bathtub towels galore not just two sinks but two arate vanities complete with toiletries and mirrors  Cue more of that ambiance lighting for a long soak in the tub I didnt avail myself of the television though If youre wondering whether or not the Peninsula is quotworthquot the extra money I would say it depends on what you value and the purpose of your trip  Some people just want the cheapest place in which to hang their hat so to speak  Other people care about the concierges ability to secure tickets and restaurant bookings  Personally I value comfortable beds good storage and closet space for hanging up my clothes and intelligent verging on indulgent bathrooms  The Peninsula fit my bill for this particular visit at this particular time though I would consider staying there again in the future if I needed to be in downtown Chicago  
P => Magnificient    If you have the money to spend on a top notch  star hotel in the loop of Chicago look no further than the Peninsula  The bellmen in the front were very courteous  The room was excellent    defiinitely the best weve stayed in If I have a complaint it was with the front desk  They fell through on a couple of tasks  Other than those things at the front desk this hotel is a   
P => My Favorite in Chicago While the views dont match the Four Seasons or Park Hyatt the Peninsula rooms are superior close to flawless and very quiet  No sounds from adjacent rooms and street noise almost completely muffled  The rooms dressing area and bath are spacious  at least in the Grand Deluxe  arate shower in bright ble bath  Impeccable service in all regards  Superb location  This was my rd or th annual stay and i continue to consider this my favorite hotel in Chicago  
P => outstanding hotel Stayed here for the first time  The hotel is outstanding  I especially enjoyed the rooftop pool and k  The k is a nice way to spend the afternoon reading the paper while looking out at the Sears Tower  The room was nice and although some prior reviews did not like the bed it was great     sank into for a sound nights sleep  The public spaces like the lobby far surpass the nearby rival Four Seasons  
P => The ultimate in comfort and elegance Beautiful and supremely comfortable room where else can you get a TV at the foot of the bath a enormous beautiful roof top pool with an amazing view and excellent food    not to mention the extremely attentive service I would actually prefer if it were slightly less fawing but thats my taste  I cant even complain about the price high because it was certainly justified by the quality  Whats not to like 
P => best in chicago from a new yorker stayed  times before once in  of  and in   and am booking agian this ust the hotel is first class food and personal service was perfect am booked again i go to Northwestern Medical every  months from Southampton NY and have had nothing but the best experiences great location  
P => Back on Top The first time we stayed at the Pen in Chicago was in  and the hotel was ranked by TampL magazine as the best in the US  While the hotel was very nice it did not live up to our expectations  Well it is two years later and things have changed We have tried both the Four Seasons and Ritz in Chicago since our last stay and from now on we will stay at the Pen when in Chicago  My main complaint the last time was the bed   it was impossible to get a good nights rest because it was hard as a rock  Well the Peninsula has rectified that issue   slept like a baby last night in a very comfortable bed  This is truly a five star hotel   the location is perfect the rooms are state of the art very high tech and the customer service from EVERYONE on the staff was top tier The Peninsula Chicago has my business forever    
P => Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful This place is heaven on earth The room was divine   I only had a view of the parking lot but who cares when the carpet is a foot thick and the bathtub is huge The bed was so comfortable I almost overslept and missed my meeting I was in town on business for  I ordered breakfast in and was perfectly satisfied I had a few hours before my flight home so I had a glass of wine in the lobby restaurant  When I needed to run out to make a phone call my waiter kept watch on my bags near my table while I was gone   that is what I call service They even had models wearing the latest from YSL walking around the room in case you had a couple thousand dollars to spare  The cost is high but if you want to know what superior service coupled with ultimate luxury is stay at this hotel 
P => Excellent hotel in great location Stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for three nights late ilearly   Guy right there at streetside to greet cab and offer to take luggage up  I line that   feel guilty having anyone carry my luggage around  Im relatively young and healthy enough I go ahead and tip the guy anyway since they probably peg you a cheapskate not that that should bother me  Check in smooth but awkward and irritating as the clerk tries through smiling face to pronounce my not really THAT difficult ethnic name over and over  I even say it slowly and have handed a written pronunciation to the person in similar situations in the past but it doesnt seem to do any good  I would just as soon not have people calling my name in public where it can be overheard  Paranoid you say Perhaps  But I did get burned in a sitaution because of that one time  Something I dont want to go through again while on the road Then clerk tries to line up transportaion limousine for your return trip to airport etc    Not really necessary I say  Asks me what time Id like turndown service each night and room make up each day  I tell him and that night when I returned  minutes after turndown time it hadnt been done  Next day two hours after room make up time request it hadnt been done  To me turndown service is like a lot of things in life    nice but hardly necessary  I do like having a room made up thoughHad a ior Suite  Very clean  arate living room and bedroom large long entrance foyer phones all over the place including three in bathroom  Bathroom very nice with TV at foot of deep tub radio console as well two arte vanities  I was there by myself so there was plenty of room  I dont mind paying for extra space  Pampering I can do without  For the most part hotel workers left me alone which I like  Im from the quotdont call me Ill call youquot school  If I need something Ill ask  Dont hover and make a lot of fuss on my account Very quiet serene dignified atmosphere permeates throughout the hotel and restaurants  Service and waitstaff at Lobby Restaurant exemplary  Food very expensive but what do you expectAll kinds of great restaurants and shops around the hotel Magnificent Mile  Walgreens across the street for sundries at good price  Hotel Gift Shop very small and comes up short in that regard  Also no ice machines or vending machines on property  Again something I dont mind doing for myself if given that opportunity  Also no mouthwash as part of bathroom products  Does have everything else Pool area and fitness rooms outstanding  Nice pool and hot tub with great views  Exercise room has many Cybex machines to work all parts of body plus usual assortment of treadmills lifecycles etc   Will definitely stay there again and am looking forward to it  
P => Worth every penny My husband and I stayed in this hotel for new years eve and had a wonderful wonderfl time  The room was beautiful and the service phenomenal  I had a massage at the spa and met my husband afterwards in the pool  The pool facilities are amazing   i wanted to spend an entire day in the locker rooom  They had fluffy towels a menthol steam room and fancy bath products in the HEALTH CLUB showers  Back at the room we had a huge bathroom with tub and double shower  There were Molton Brown products there as well  The bed was divine and there was a remote control next to it on both sides that controlled the drapes and lights in the entire room  There was a welcome bag with little treats when we got there  The next morning i had breakfast with girlfriends in the little cafe next door which was wonderful too  One of the best new years eves I have ever had  
P => One of the Best in the US Spent five wonderful nights at this terrific hotel  It is the staff and service that set this hotel apart from others  First class professional and friendly I normally only experience service like this in five star hotels in Asia  The Pen Chicago brings five star service to the U S  Management is doing something right here  The lobby bar dinner was quite expensive and not too great  Other than that no complaints  Cannot wait to return to Chicago and stay at the Pen  
P => Elegant with excellent service My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago over the New Years weekend  The hotel is elegantly orated and the service was excellent  I was a little disapointed with the food  We had afternoon tea on New Years Eve and felt the food could have been a little better  It lacked freshness ever so slightly  Okay so Im comparing the food to my tea experience at Claridges in London in ober   I would still recommend the hotel  
P => Truly a pleasure Stayed at the Peninsula for one night in late ember and had an absolutely wonderful experience From the first contact with the staff to the last everything was flawless  A request for a high floor even though I was paying a discount rate quotCertainly sir how about a room on our th top floor overlooking Michigan Avenue quot OK  minutes later housekeeping wants to confirm the age of our dhter to get the appropriate robe and slipper size  An hour later room service is knocking or ringing the doorbell rather to deliver a complimentary welcome gift a tray of fresh chocolate chip cookies a bottle of coke gummy bears and jello    all for the kids  Rooms without children seemed to be receiving a tray of dried fruits and nuts which also looked very good  Upon checkout which took all of about  seconds the clerk was efficient and friendly while also acting warm and sincere  Physically the hotel is gorgeous and impecabbly clean  Our double bedded room was large with a nice seating area comfortable desk and a nice little hallway between the bathroom and bedroom  Molton Brown amenities and super soft towels completed the experience  In the bedroom bed sheets were soft and luxurious although I must admit the bed wasnt as good as some in lower class properties although it was still comfortable  The Spa is a must on the upper two levels of the hotel with great locker rooms a cool pool fitness room and a great selection of teas coffee citrus water and fruits in between  The conceirge staff effortlessly handled our questions and gave great recommendations for breakfast  When I called down for directions to a theater they had it drawn out in minutes  But thinking back on the experience it all goes back to the staff which truly made the trip  Every member of the hotel made an effort to greet us in the hall and all seemed to care about their jobs delivering service that was super professional but also not snotty  Needless to say I cant wait to go back  
P => Family Trip to Chicago for Thanksgiving We stayed at this hotel from   ember with our children ages  amp   Since many of the reviews touch on the beauty of the hotel which is as beautiful as everyone says Ill gear my review towards those traveling with small children and trying to ide if this hotel is a good fit   Location  The Peninsula was perfectly situated for all our excursions to the various museums around town since its a block from Watertower the Disney store on Michigan a couple blocks from Lake Shore Drive and about  blocks from the quotElquot elevated trainssubway  The American Girl store is on the same block around the corner and the Hershey Store and Girardelli were just a few steps more  Plenty of shopping for everyone on Michigan Ave   Staff  Everyone was friendly to us and our children  The staff of Avenues was fantastic  Those on the Lobby Restaurant were hit or miss    RestaurantsFood  The Childrens Afternoon Tea in the Lobby was yummy with mini hamburgers PB amp J amp ham and cheese in addition to the sweets and a pot of hot chocolate  Pierre Gourmet the French Cafe just outside the main entrance was perfect for breakfast and probably for lunch  The staff and friendly and attentive to us and our children  Room service did well by us when we ordered dessert for the family one evening  Everything arrived on time and was as ordered  The hotel does have a childrens menu at the Lobby and Avenues but the selection is somewhat limited   Pool  There are three swimming lanes and a hot tub on the th floor  There were a few swimmers swimming laps while we were there who were politely tolerant of the  children in the area  While not ideal for children or those who are swimming laps for that matter it might make a good  minute diversion   Pen Kids Package  We researched the various packages at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton before picking the Peninsula  The most kid friendly package was at the Ritz Carlton and it provided the most value for the   If you choose the Peninsula I would go with the standard room rate or the American Girl package and spend the additional per night from the Pen Kids Package elsewhere  With the package the kids got a nice welcome snack Pen Kids multi color backpacks a signature bear who cant keep its pants on crayons and some coloring paper  We also received two coupons one for ice cream at Bloomingdales and childrens admission to the Childrens Museum at Navy Pier  A better investment is to buy a family membership at your local ASTC museum which had reciprocity at a number of museums in Chicago Museum of Science amp Industry Childrens Museum and Field Museum to name only a few   Room  Our bathroom was a nice extension of the main room  Whenever we were there the kids wanted to take a bath and watch cartoons  This came in handy if one of the kids wanted to nap or as a diversion if one woke up before the other in the morning   We also took advantage of the Thanksgiving buffet offered by the hotel  The food came from all three restaurants and exceeded our expectations  The hotel had also created a arate kids area with movies playstation and crafts that our kids enjoyed  The only negative were the  mimosas we ordered with the meal but thought were included with the buffet All in all the Peninsula is a wonderful hotel in a great location  It is clear that the chain is trying to cater to families   the kids room during the buffet was a good example of this  
P => Great experience in Chicago When I arrived at the Peninsula after the usual traffic filled ride from OHare I was completedly frazzled and must have shown it  The check in person asked me for my favorite wine and  minutes after I reached my beautiful suite a glass of complimentary wine arrived  What a treat I have stayed at the Peninsula again and the rooms and service are terrific  So are both of the restaurants  I have stayed at the Peninsulas in Hong Kong and Bankok both of which have better views but in all other respects the Chicago Peninsula is in their category of among the best hodels in the world  
P => Close but not quite perfection The Peninsula in Chicago is an adventure in extravagance  Our suite was charming spacious and with the most extraordinary bathroom Ive ever encountered in a hotel complete with an enormous soaking tub overlooking the Chicago skyline   and a built in television behind glass so you could catch the news while indulging in a bubble bath  It became my habit  Our bedlinens were crisp and soft at the same time and control panels for the lights the radio the television and the front door quotprivacyquot light were well placed throughout the suite always a finger touch away  The hotels public areas are unapologetically grand amazing vistas endless ceilings and gleaming ble floors  Our only complaints Room service could be a bit time consuming it often took forty minutes to an hour a far longer wait then say the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills or the ever speedy Covent Garden Hotel in London  Once we even placed a simple order a pot of coffee and it never arrived  And the valet wasnt too speedy delivering our luggage upon departure we must have waited fifteen minutes  If the staff can learn the value of alacrity then this hotel will rapidly become a true favorite of mine  
P => Wow I can see why this hotel is   in the USA After our trip fell thru down to florida bc my parents still didnt have power from Wilma the hubby and I ided to take a short trip to chicago  We usually only stay at the Four Seasons but ided to try the Peninsula based on pics and reviews on here   and WOW We loved itFrom the moment we arrived   how the head doorman greeted us and they took care of our bags  we got there early at am and our room was ready   we were personally brought to it and given a tour  we then stepped out and got some lunch   unfortunately their french bistro was booked solid and i didnt want to wait  hour   so we ate on michigan  upon returning to the hotel they had placed a bottle of champage and choc dipped strawberries and whipped creme out for us what a TREAT i then took a bath in the great tub with the tv   adn set the mood lighting so much funwe had a dinner reservation at Shangai terrace   and i will agree with the last review   i wasnt that impressed with the food  to me it didnt seem to have much taste at all  i got the wok seared lobster and my hubby got the kobi filet   we also got a bottle of wine and splurged on  teas which were amazing  we had a pm reservation for the chocolate buffet   but we were so exhuasted from the day we ided to pass   but i bet it is amazingupon waking up sunday morning i called to see if we could get a late checkout    they just told me to quotname the timequot   so we didnt even have to check out until pmi had booked my hubby for a massage at the spa and myself a facial   the spa and pool are GREAT on the th and th floors of the hotel great viwes my hubby loved working out and looking at lake michigan we did have lunch at pierre gourmet then   it was only a  min wait   EXCELLENT food i felt like i was back in france  tables are very close together and the wait people have to watch out from bumping into one another   but itsnt that truly what a french cafe isone other thing about the hotel   im an Orchid lover   and i could not believe the huge gorgeous orchids they had all around the hotel such an oriental gorgeous look location as well cannot be beat right across the street from Saks and Neimanns and within walking distance to all that i love about Michigan Ave What a great trip The hotel made all the difference and we will be returning 
P => Only one drawback The Peninsula is almost perfect  Simply beautiful hotel  We generally stay at the Four Seasons in Chicago and ided to try the Peninsula for a change  Staff is superb rooms relatively spacious and location cant be beat  Only one negative  If you are seeking a quiet enviroment the Peninsula  fall short  Our first room faced Michigan Aveneue and even on the th floor the street noise was significant  Also our room had a connecting door and the sounds from the room next us were annoying enough that I requested a room change  Staff handled the request quickly and professionally  Our new room faced Chicago Ave and was much better  I do understand that if you want to stay in the heart of a major metro area you will have noise  Although I will say that weve not had noise problems at the Four Seasons  And it borders Michigan Ave also But overall the Peninsula is a real treat  Just as a sidebar I didnt think the Shanghai Terrace was that good  Its ok but the food had too much msg  
P => Superb Pure luxury  It would be difficult to find fault with this hotel  The rooms are fantastic   you cant argue with a TV in the bathroom   the staff always anxious to help   and the location for perfect for the Magnificent Mile  If you are able to stay here take the chance 
P => A rekable hotel    This hotel is rekable every possible need of every guest is met  The staff is perfectly trained food even for meetings was excellent  I will return without fail  
P => Best in Chicago by far There is no doubt that this is the best hotel in Chicago  We have stayed at the Four Seasons Ritz Carlton Drake Whitehall Hyatt and others and none of them have come close to the quality of the Peninsula  The location is perfect right next to the Water Tower   all the great shopping and restaurants in walking distance and the quotLquot two blocks away  The hotel is new I think it opened in  so all the features and amenities are up to date  The bedside control panels allows one to turn onoff all the lights control the radio and TV adjust the thermostat check the outside temperature and turn on the do not disturb light outside your room  The beds are as good as the famously wonderful beds at the Four Seasons  The baths are big with double sinks arate tub with a TV and shower big thick towels and the toilet is behind a arate door  I just stayed there for my birthday and the hotel gave me a complimentary bottle of French Champagne and a chocolate cake as an arrival gift  The double corner exective suite is spacious and full of light and at night is less than similar but not as nice type rooms at the Four Seasons and Ritz I think the standard rooms start at around   The restaurants are wonderful  Avenues is one of the best restaurants in town the beautiful lobby restaurant with  story wall of windows is great for lunch tea or cocktails and the deliwine bar on the ground floor makes for a great lunchbrunch we didnt get to the Shanghai Terrace  The service is absolutely wonderful all around  The concierge are friendly very knowledgable and helpful  They of course have slippers and robes  The rooms have stereo DVD player VCR fax and high speed internet access  I noted no negatives allowing dogs is a major plus in my book you just cant beat this place 
P => different take on hotel than other reviewers Made reservation over the   number which I was told came out of Hong Kong my fault I didnt ask if hotel was pet friendly until we are at hotel dining with pets and I mean pets everywhere and my husband is allergic we asked at front desk if they had rooms that had not had pets in them NO I LOVE animals but come on you know most sleep with there owners and I myself at the rate of  for the room said no thanks and drove back home to Indy  The bellman said most hotels are on Michigan Avenue  
P => A class apart in Chicago It lived up to all my expectations of a Peninsula hotel this being my first one  The or restaurants rooms and bathrooms were top notch   although service was not up to the standards of a Four Seasons  The cigar bar is a trendy spot on a Friday night the lap pool and outdoor terace gives the feel of an urban resort  All in all made my first trip to Chicago a memorable one 
P => Could have been superb Well   what can you say about one of the elite  five star hotels in the country Besides being EXPENSIVE Room   minibar room service It is a sublime experience   right down to the slippers  Most people that stay here are used to being pampered and the Peninsula does not disaapoint  However   I was very disappointed with the valet service   insomuch to the point of being downright cranky about it  I called down from my room prior to checkout at about  am and asked for my car to be sent  At  I was still waiting for it with a  am flight from Midway needless to say I missed my flight  The gentleman at the valet podium was very apologetic and trying hard to compensate with extremely charming conversation but I was upset nonetheless  My car did not arrive until    ONE WHOLE HOUR after I called for it  This is very bad  They explained that they were putting air in my tire   which is very nice but it had been there overnight and had plenty of time to do so without jeopardizing my flight  Will I stay at the Peninsula again Ye of course  It is one of only two five star hotels in Chicago  The other being the Four Seasons  And even though the Peninsula is more expensive about   more per night for a standard room it is less quotsnobbyquot my opinion less quotput onquot with all the amenties and ambience expected for the   per night plus room rate  The room service menu is good but a little to PanAsian  Could do with a little more versatility though there are a few quotmidwesternquot options  The bed and linens   excellent   better than home  I slept like a baby  The bathroom is fantastic   way better than the Four Seasons  Just take my advice and make sure they bring you your car on time I luckily was able to catch another flight  minutes later and it didnt really affect my trip   but if I had bee going somewhere else it could have been a real issue  
P => Beautiful Hotel My husband  year old dhter and I just returned from a weekend at the Chicago Penninsula Hotel  It was great The hotel was beautiful and the staff was wonderful While we were checking in my dhter was playing with her  American Girl dolls  One of the people at check in noticed and sent up  little bathrobes and  little beds for the dolls without us even asking for it or being told about it Also after returning from dinner that night we were pleasantly surprised to find a note not only welcoming us but cookies gummie bears for my dhter and a fruit tray for us We loved the hotel also because of all the little details to attention  We tried the chocolate buffet one night as well   which is not to be missed It was excellent We stayed in a Grand Deluxe king room  It was a very nice room  the only thing is it is a little tightly spaced but not too uncomfortable  I also tried the spa and it was very nice as well  The exercise room and pool area had a very open feel too it  Overall it was a great hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone  
P => Excellence I live in Chicago and stayed at the Peninsula Chicago last year for two nights   the night before my wedding and then with my new husband on our wedding night  We had a suite   living room bedroom and   bathrooms  The room is beautiful   orated in contemporary classic style with the main bathroom being huge and gorgeous with ble everywhere  There is also a TV built into the wall over the bathtub Everything is immaculate and very nicely appointed The service at the hotel is fantastic  In the room they left us champagne fruits nuts candies and a box of Vosges chocolates  The most wonderful service was at am when my husband woke up realizing he had not taken out his contact lenses and had forgotten to pack solution    He called the front desk   they sent someone out to the nearby Walgreens store and brought back a contact lens case and solution  We did not try the restaurants but we have been to the bar on other occasions for a drink  Its nice with a good atmosphere  The drinks are good and they provide little snacks as well I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others  I had such a good experience here that we will be staying in the Peninsula Bangkok during our first year anniversary trip this year 
P => Beautiful and welcoming a truly superb hotel Everything youve heard about this hotel is true  It is simply wonderful and will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago from now on  Ive stayed in many hotels around the world and this is easily in the top  for service and standards We ended up stopping here through a twist of fate it being the start of Memorial Day weekend in the States and our original hotel having overbooked by a mile  Left struggling for room we started phoning every hotel in the city and luckily my third call was to the Peninsula  They had a room and did us a very good rate considering the busy state of the city that weekend  Not that it mattered as the original hotel were picking up the tab but Im not one to take liberties When we arrived rather worn out and bedraggled the door staff had our bags before we could get out of the cab We then took the short lift up to the th floor check in area and were treated like kings from then on  We were given a deluxe room and boy was it deluxe  Beautiful and huge really well furnished and orated with a bathroom bigger than some normal rooms Ive stayed in  The staff really went out of their way to give us everything they could as though they had been at fault for the over booking at our other hotelOther facilities are equally great  The gym and spa are excellent with a wonderful outside seating area on the th floor outside the pool which is heaven in the sunshine  The restaurant was as good as I expected breakfast being particularly superb with the chefs willing to make anything you wanted In short if you really want to treat yourself and stay somewhere where the excellent staff match the fantastic surroundings then pick the Peninsula  You really wont regret stopping here  
P => The Creme de la Creme of Hotels Excellent excellent excellent from the time we walked in the door until we got into our cab for the airport  The service is impeccable  The computerized lighting system in the room is to die for  It was fun just testing out the different light settings  The bathroom has a TV that is encased in fog free glass and the sound is piped in through the ceiling  The Peninsula Chicago is divine 
P => The best which is no small feat I have stayed at the Peninsula  times  Used to be that the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton a Four Seasons hotel were the creme de la creme in Chicago but then comes the Park Hyatt and the Peninsula and suddenly the FS and RC are almost provincial  Of course theyre not but the Peninsula has brought an even more sublime sense of hospitality to the Windy City  It is a perfect hotel  The Lobby Restaurant is a high ceiling space with soaring windows a wonderful menu and live cabaret music on weekends  Avenues is haute haute cuisine and Shanghai Terrace is the best this side of well Shanghai summer evenings on the terrace are experiences that will have you profoundly appreciate the time and space you are priviledged to occupy  I love the room service which is quietly efficient and always prompt  The Peninsula is best at meeting individual needs and desires and strangely faulters when striving to meet group needs I think their effort to bring their legendary individual attention to groups is mathematically impossible  Can a large groups entrees be tabled simultaneously without compromising quality Unlikely  But that is my only observed shortcoming  This is by far my hotel of choice in Chicago  
P => Almost    perfect After reading the Travel amp Leisure article giving the Peninsula the   ranking in service out of all hotels and resorts in the U S  I was a little surprised to find upon arriving on a Sunday at the check in time of  p m  that my room wasnt ready  The young man at the registration desk said he would quotput two maids on itquot and took down my cell phone number so he could call me as soon as it was ready  I returned   hours later having received no phone call  My room still wasnt ready but after a brief wait they found another one  The man next to me was complaining that he needed to take a shower and his room wasnt ready  Even more surprising when the rest of my group arrived at  p m  only one of their three rooms was ready  It took an additional hour until  p m  before we all had our rooms Apparently there was a large convention group leaving that day and the Peninsula was having trouble getting the rooms made up  The hotel was full  Another thing that surprised me was that while we waited we werent shown a little more love  A small gesture like quotWould you like a free bottle of water or cup of coffee while you waitquot would have helped smooth some ruffled feathers Speaking of coffee it irked us a little that at a  star hotel one has to pay for something   coffee in the room   that is free at the lowliest Holiday Inn Express  A small carafe of coffee from room service will run about  total  However the Peninsula does give you free bottled water with the evening turndown service  Be sure to use the  privacy  and  make up room  buttons  You are locked out while housekeeping is making up the room   I assume for the maids  safety and to secure your belongings  so you want to make sure they get in there to clean when it is convenient for you  That said this is a stunningly beautiful hotel with top notch amenities  The extra items requested from housekeeping arrived in fewer than  minutes this was my second stay  And how many hotels have a built in tv above the extra large ble bathtub   in a standard room The rooms are so large comfortable and gorgeous that its hard to leave them  I have to agree with the other posting though that the extra long bathtub is a bit of a challenge for anyone under      If you re not careful your feet go up and your head goes down  I was able to hang on by gripping the other end of the tub with my toes and putting a towel under my head  It s kind of hard to get out of too  But I wanted to watch tv in the tub so I was motivated  The shower was heavenly  The glass door comes within   of the ceiling   enough to vent the shower without fogging up the bathroom  I didn t find the bathroom  tight  it s about   x   square probably the largest standard hotel bathroom I ve been in I can t imagine what a previous post found to complain about the beds  They are wonderful  It does take a little practice to operate all the light switches etc  but if you can t find one just call the front desk and ask them  The spa and pool areas are especially nice  The pool and hot tub are indoors but there is an outdoor terrace next to them  There are full blown locker rooms a large well equipped workout room and free classes in pilates yoga etc  Several of the others in our party had massages which they raved about I had a standard pedicure for  The only other issue I had was upon checking out  I was presented with a bill for my stay which was supposed to have been charged to another person in our party  I was surprised because at check in they had confirmed that my room was already paid for  However the clerk checked again and it was worked out  
P => Nice but how about a better bed The Peninsula is a very beautiful hotel and the service was indeed top notch but one of the most important qualities in a lodging establishment for me when I travel is one of the most basic   how well did I sleep  Unfortunately this is where the Peninsula was well below a five star rating  Surprisingly the bed was worse than some Ive had at mid grade chains  Also the room had a very high tech console on the bed stand with controls for all the lights and TV but I never could figure out how to turn off the extensive floor level night lights that were so bright that I was forced to crawl under the bed and unplug them for the second night  All in all next time in Chicago Ill go to a Four Seasons  
P => Just perfect I stayed only one night from     il  in a suite overlooking the watertower  All staff were very friendly and helpful  The service was perfect and also the food in the main restaurant was very nice  In the later evening I enjoyed the bar a very trendy and popular place in Chicago  The  bedroom suite and the lovely bathroom made me dreaming  This hotel is just perfect and in my opinion the best choice for Chicago  Absolutely wonderful nothing to complain about  
P => First Rate Customer Service We have stayed at the Peninsula twice now  first in   and most recently on     Both times were without a flaw  The rooms are wonderful even the standard rooms the location is perfect the dining is sumptuous and the customer service is unlike any other I have experienced and we travel quite a bit We once stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago because the Peninsula was booked but still went to the Peninsula for the Chocolate Buffett which was to die for  
P => Great hotel Well located off the magic mile the or and room appointment superb staff of the highest calibre services that boggle the mind  what a stay i had early ch  truly memorableThe hotel is just simply one of the best i have stayed in from location to or to staff to everything   i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wanted the best in surroundings and comfort Well worth the price and very few hotels i have stayed in around the world could compare with all the peninsula has to offer    it is hard to describe absolute perfection 
P => No discrimination at the THE LOBBY I heartily disagree with the review from a disgruntled dining patron of THE LOBBY at the Hotel Peninsula dated y   advising those who are not W A S P s to avoid dining there I have dined several times at THE LOBBY while visiting my dhter in Chicago and have always been more than pleased  As a Hispanic family we have found the Peninsula staff to be very professional yet open and friendly to all patrons  We have always had  STAR service from the entire wait staff in THE LOBBY  The food is always delicious and freshly prepared to perfection  I have witnessed people of every race and culture dining at THE LOBBY and observed all were treated most graciously  The staff is multilingual and ready to make everyone comfrotable in their dining experience I plan to have Sunday tea or enjoy the Chocolate Night Buffet when I am back in Chicago this ch 
P => Outstanding We had a wonderful experience  We frequent many  stars and would rank The Peninsula at the very top  We were there for  nights the last wk of   We booked the mothers day brunch at the hotel and that was so tasty with a great variety We booked an executive suite  It was very nice with a well equipped bathroom  We had a TV at the tub and a arate shower stall  Most importantly everything was very clean The location on Michigan Ave was terrific for shopping  Almost a little too good as I spent alot bc everything was so closeWe have stayed at well appointed hotels but what is critical to us is the level of service  It was outstanding here  A few mistakes were made but quickly corrected and a bottle of champagne sent up as a token of their apology  We took our son and that was great  They had my sons diapers ready in our room and a very cute bath set for him as well  My only disappointment was that I had just missed the cast of Oceans  staying there by a few days 
P => Completely perfect From the  level entrance   to the LARGE gorgeous rooms   this was a perfect experience The service was unreal the rooms were fully equipped with every possible modern tvstereo lighting toy possible and the view was to die for  I took better pictures of Chicagos skyline inside my hotel suite than outside  After visiting the Park Hyatt one block next door there is NO comparision  The rooms at the Peninsula are top notch yet still maintain a very comfortable feel  The price Yes a little high   but worth every penny for a very special stay  
P => Plan an Experience    Turn on the music tap Privacy Please set Mood Lighting sip your wine    and plan an experience  And when Room Service asks if you would like your coffee cream warmed just say yes  It will make their hearts happy  
P => Did not want to leave I am currently undergoing withdrawal from the Peninsula  This hotel has been rated as number  in the United States on Conde Nasts Gold list and it lives up to its reputation  The executive suite we stayed in was simply stunning as was the lobby  Great live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights in the lobby impeccable service from front desk and concierge fabulous bathrooms with a television above the bathtub are some of the many highlights  Although the hotel is a bit pricey it really is worth splurging  We were able to get a discounted rate complimentary breakfast and a room upgrade to an executive suite by booking through a virtuso agent central travel in Toledo Ohio  We will definitely be going back  
P => impeccable The Peninsula  not be the newest or the glitziest hotel but its intelligent staff make it one of the best  Our reservation preceded and exended past my husbands cancer surgery at Northwesterns medical center  It was a time of distraction and apprehension that might have been exacerbated by a disinterested place a Hotel Land of the Living Dead  To a woman and man the Peninsulas staff displayed quiet professional concern by their words and actions  Examples Sensing that this would be a difficult time for us our reservationist booked us into rooms that were extraordinarily quiet given the hotels proximity to the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue  At a particularly trying moment when only chicken soup not on the menu would do the Peninsula improvised smoothly and promptly fresh fettucine and grilled chicken chunks in a tasty reduction amazing really  Housekeeping worked rapidly around our schedule not theirs  Those who have traveled a bit know about phony attentiveness and indifference  I encountered neither not once during our extended stay  
P => Excellent Our stay at the Peninsula Chicago for four days in y was absolutely wonderful  The staff was very proffessional but at the same time very down to earth and pleasant  The room service was great and our children were very welcomed and made comfortable  
P => Its interesting that  previous reviewers did not enjoy the Peninsula but I can certainly see their point  In the case of the Asian bar guy it seems rather odd that his complaint had to do with discrimination when practically the entire hotel is staffed with Asians and other minorities  Anyway as an Asian reviewer myself I enjoyed my experience at the Peninsula and I am glad that I did not have the same experience  Its hard to deal with situations like that but the thing not to do is let it escalate  The Peninsula Chicago was avery pleasant experience for me and my partner  
P => Great experience Spent the th of y weekend at the Peninsula Hotel  This is a fantastic hotel  The location right off of Michigan Ave  adjacent to the Old Water Tower is very convenient  The service was outstanding  All of the staff were very friendly  The facilities are first class  The room was terrific with a very large bathroom with a arate shower and tub  There was a TV installed in the wall adjacent to the tub area so that you could watch TV while taking a bath  Everything in the room e g  lights TV AC etc  can be controlled from a console next to the bed  There is a wonderful spa located at the top of the hotel with a great view of Michigan Ave  from the fitness area and the pool  This is a true spa and not just your typical hotel fitness room and pool  They have a great restaurant in the main lobby that offers a coffee and dessert buffet with live music on Friday and Saturday nights known as Chocolate at the Pen  The Sunday Brunch is simply amazing  We truly cant say enough nice things about this hotel  We are anxious to return as soon as possible  
P => Spectacular Hotel Purchased a package at this hotel and it was delightful  I have traveled extensively and have very high standards when it comes to luxury hotels  The Peninsula met and exceeded in every category  Our room an executive suite was imaculate and extened from the building giving us large views of the city on  sides including the Sears Tower  Its in a great area and the service was nearly flawless  Of course there were a couple of minor issues here and there but nothing worth even mentioning  If youre willing to spend the money to stay here you will most likely not be disappointed and will probably be thrilled  
P => Luxury at your fingertips This is one of the very rare places where you wouldnt want leave and go back home Convenience and Luxury blend suprbly adding to that the quotfine cuisinequot  I give this place six stars 
P => Loved it A most excellent place for one to stay at  Service very professional room best I have seen  Welcome to America 
P => Great Hotel the best My wife dhter and I returned to the Peninsula Chicago over Memorial Day weekend having previously stayed there in ember   Having stayed at a number of Ritz Carltons and similar hotels this is the hotel Id love to move into  My  year old dhter and I love the pool which is roughly  feet long and has great views  Great gym and Spa facilities with views of the lake  While we did not dine at the fancier restaurants our breakfast in the lobby restaurant and the adjoining French cafe were excellent  Staff was very helpful  As other people have said the rooms are great and it can be hard to leave them  We are hopefully going to make a family tradition of a staying there every couple of years

P => Excellent hotel Having read previous reviews we were a little bit sceptical about chosing the Knickerbocker Hotel  It was though a very pleasant surprise  The staff was polite dynamic and helpful  The rooms were extremelly clean and comfortable  Yes rooms are small though not too small for a big city but oration is original and beautiful  The piano in the lobby is a big plus  The first excellent point about this hotel is its charm  The second its perfect location  
P => LOVED my stay here I had also read poor reviews of this hotel but could not have BEEN more pleased  I got the park and play package just  a night for unlimited in out and a large classic room with two bathrooms  One had a stand up shower and was larger the other was smaller with a tub shower combo  The room was nice and clean and I had outstanding service from everyone there  The people in NiX the restuaurant were very kind and helpful even though we were just eating the free breakfast  You are a block from the John Hancock building and right behind a Louis Vuitton store  PLENTY of great shopping and bars within walking distance and the CTA stops are relatively nearby as well  I would not HESITATE to stay here again next time I come to Chicago  
P => The real deal on the Knickerbocker For a  star hotel this place is left much to be desired  Add an inattentive staff to the lackluster accomodations and youve got the very medicocre Knickerbocker Any hotel you stay at on Chicagos Magnificent Mile is in a quotgood locationquot but this one is a short building tucked away on one of the back streets toward the end of the quotMilequot so views accessibility and scenery are not the best No one on the staff took the extra mile here   service was bare bone  At the front desk at the conceirge an aging befuddling old man who   while cute   did not know much about the city at the restaurant at the front door   nothing was spectacular  The rooms feature lithographed copies of oil paintings in peeling frames as well as a few other amenities which had seen better days  The TV selection featured only a dozen channels even every budget hotel these days has a larger selection  The tiny rooms have paper thin walls which make the plumbing the conversations and the movement of all your neighboring guests sound like they are in the room with you  All night  The bathroom had a stand up shower but no bathtub At the Knickerbocker the free internet is not free the complimentary turn down service is not automatic and the nostalgic charm this historic hotel COULD have is muted under the management of the current owners  Among Chicagos grand lobbies and beautiful buildings the Knickerbocker does not even compare If you pricelined this hotel oh well you could do worse while in Chicago  If you are planning on paying full price for this hotel stay somewhere else and be much happier  
P => Loved the hotel This hotel was so elegant  It is in a wonderful location and the rooms were spacious  I had excellent service  I would stay here again  Yes the bathrooms are small but they served their purpose and who spends alot of time in the bathrooms anyway We were within walking distance of so many places including the Navy Pier and the Hancock Building  I had no complaints about this beautiful hotel  
P => great location nice hotel for the money My husband and I stayed here for  nights in y  We absolutely loved the location next to all the high end stores and  blocks from the John Hancock building I got a rate of  a night from chicago com Our room was small but on a high floor  I am not a fan of eclectic oriental or however the bed was very comfortable and the room service menu charged the same price as the restaurant menu except for the service charge  
P => Terrible check in policy My wife and I had a reservation for  nights at the MK in ust   Due to a change of plan we ided to stay over at a friends place the first night and move to the hotel the next day  Inspite of having our reservation from the previous day the hotel staff made us wait till the check in time of  pm when we arrived at the hotel the next day  Mind you all this after having called them the previous night and informing them about the change of plan and them saying it was OK for us to chek in in the morning Since the reservation had been made through Priceline couldnt get a refund for one day  Pluses   Pretty nice and cozy  But some of the fixtures are very old  
P => Not worthy of AAA four diamond My wife and our  yr old dhter stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker the first week end of e   It was our first time visiting Chicago as tourists  What a great city       the downtown area in which we stayed was fantastic  We wish we could say the same for the MK  Shall we say the quotold girlquot needs some work and were not just talking make up here  Is there a plastic surgeon in the houseWe stayed in a corner suite and it was very outdated  Multiple coats of paint covering baseboards that should have been replaced years ago  Less than spotless bathroom  A quotclub floorquot room that had little other than a fridge filled wtih sodas and a PC that time forgot internet connection    whats that The staff at check in had forgotten to provide vouchers for breakfast which were included in the room rate for the week end  When asked it was if they were doing us a huge favor    did I hear sorry   be under their breath at a resounding  ibels Pluses Very nice lobby and a great location just off Michigan Ave Definitely not worthy of a  diamond rating by AAA  Rating the MK in this manner puts AAAs credibility at risk   just how do the AAA staffers get paid For my  night Ill take accomodation and breakfast requirements to one of the many other fine hotels in Chicago  
P => Valet stole from my car I stayed from e    My  skateboard was stolen out of my car the first night I had it valet parked  No one from the hotel or parking garage has been helpful in any way  The room was tiny and overpriced although I had booked it through priceline  a night  Dont stay here 
P => Sweet location SOUR value Its right off the mile which is great    especially when youre a little tipsy and its your first time in the Chi  However when I pay close to  bucks I dont appreciate seeing cracks in my ceiling  The room was not very big either  Overall the only thing that this place really has going for it is the location which is killer  
P => Dont book on priceline I stayed here for  nights last summer  I booked the reservation on priceline for night which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week  Anyway when I arrived at  pm from the airport I was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me  They booked me at a dumpy  star motel by the airport  They gave me  for a taxi to get there and it cost me   I was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packingunpacking  The Millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul up  No free drink no room upgrade nothing  Since I booked on the internet I was chopped liver  Beware  
P => Perfect Chicago Location I just stayed two nights at this property  My room was clean check in and check out was fast the staff was helpful and friendly  The hotel is in a great location across from the Drake a half block off Michigan Ave  It appeared the hotel had been reated and it was complete  My only complaints     the bath is small and only the ac OR the heat can be on in the hotel at the sametime  Ask which is being used before you arrive if the seasons are changing 
P => Great Location Stayed in the Millenium Knickerbocker in il  for seven nights  Staff were really friendly on check in and the concierge was always able to answer our questions The room itself was small but the kingsized bed was very comfortable  Nicely orated but very dark due to surrounding buildings  You would need the light on during the day  Bathroom very small but adequate Only complaint is that the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything I would ask for a room away from the elevators when booking as Im sure these would be very noisey at all times Restaurant was lovely  Only ever had the buffet breakfast but there was plenty of choice and the staff are very attentive  Location is excellent  at the top of the magnificent mile  Always plenty of taxis at the door and youre in the main shopping area which is always good  Surrounding area felt very safe  
P => Great Location More Reations Needed My wife and I stayed at the Knickerbocker il     The location is excellent a quick walk to the Lake Michigan walking paths and terrific shopping on Michigan Avenue and restaurants on Rush Street  This hotel is very old and after visiting their website we were under the impression that extensive reations were complete  We were ready for the small room but not ready for the toilet that required multiple flushes the sink that would not drain and the shower head that needed to be replaced  The staff was very responsive to all of our complaints but the maintenance man that told us not to use more than  sheets of toilet paper or the toilet would clog took the prize  We will not return here  
P => Great Location You cant beat the location It was perfect right off the Magnificant Mile Michigan Avenue  The hotel was nice and and the staff friendly  We had a king room which was somewhat small but didnt matter too much  I would have preferred a bit bigger bathroom but we managed just fine  Remember its an older hotel and they didnt make the rooms very big at that time  I found a price online at around  however when I called the hotel I got it for  a night  Wow what a deal Taxis were abundant outside the hotel  Not once did we ever have to wait for a taxi    what convenience this was  We ate the buffet breakfast in the Nix restaurant one morning and it was very good  On our last day we checked out at Noon however we werent leaving until late in the day and they kept our luggage for us until we were ready to pick it up in the late afternoon  We appreciated this  I would recommend this hotel as its location is really good and the price wasnt bad either 
P => Great location on Magnificent Mile Older hotel small but a perfect location We enjoyed our stay here in ruary   As long as you know it is an older hotel with small rooms   you wont be disappointed  Our rate was night and I would stay there again because of its location Another plus   never had a problem getting a cab outside the hotel front door This hotel has an INCREDIBLE ballroom  We attended a wedding here  The wait staff does a first class job  
P => Weekend Shopping Spree with my Husband and  Sisters We stayed at the Knickerbocker on uary  for a one night shopping spree  The double room was somewhat old in appearance but that was to be expected in an older hotel  However the bathroom had NO exhaust fan and was terribly small  There was no way two people could occupy the bathroom at the same time That is a problem when there are  women sharing a room with one man We were on the th floor which looked out toward the Drake  The night time constuction noise went on until  a m  Unless we found an extremely good deal we would not stay there again  
P => Not Again Very very over rated  Small and cramped rooms with only a shower  There were only  rooms booked on our floor and we could hear the other people through the walls  Very pricey parking  
P => Disappointed this time around I have enjoyed staying at the Knickerbocker in the past but was disappointed on my most recent stay  The rooms are starting to show a little wear around the edges  I did notice that there is some equipment in the hotel so hopefully they are in the process of upgrading  The Knickerbocker has a great bar right in the lobby and usually bustling with activity  The staff is always friendly and helpful  Checking in and out of this hotel can be a bit of a hassle because the front desk area is small and is inconveniently located at the far end of the lobby  
P => Good value great location  Thought this hotel was worth the nt although day for parking was steep  The location is great  right off Michigan ave and accross from the Drake hotel  Our room was fairly large with a partial canopy bed full size couch two stuffed chairs and two TVs  My only complaint was the noise   really loud between the construction in the morning and people coming in at night  
P => Tricked at the Knick The room was so small that you couldnt walk around the bed when the TV cabinet was open making it feel very claustrophobic  The bathroom was so small that you could barely turn around  The or in the room was confusing a bordello like atmosphere that clashed with everything in sight  After spending one night in the hotel we checked out and moved to Hotel  where we got a bigger room at a lower price with a fantastic view of the Chicago River  
P => Dont knock the Knickerbocker To get the best out of Chicago you cant beat a central location   and this hotel certainly has that  Admittedly there is a slight air of faded glory about some of the rooms but when we werent satisfied with our original room a quick word at the desk had us moved to a much nicer one Thereafter our trip went swimmingly   especially our time spent in the tini Lounge    which has just the best atmosphere wonderful live jazz piano and a fabulous cocktail bar  Sipping our drinks and watching the world go by lots of beautiful people when we were ther was a great way to unwind after an exhausting day sightseeing prior to going out to dinner  Well done Millennium Knickerbocker  
P => High Style of Yesteryear This hotel while older has held up very well  The public spaces are exceptionally appointed and the piano bar in the lobby is a nice touch  The rooms while on the smaller side typical for a hotel of this time were very clean and richly furnished  The staff was very hospitable  It is located a block off of Michigan Avenue and is convenient to shopping restaurants perhaps this explains why the hotel restaurant was always deserted and Oak St  Beach  For style and nostalgia a two thumbs up  
P => Millenium Knickerbocker  
P => Never Again  
P => Fantastic  
P => Great Hotel  
P => Quaint and homey with a must have location  
P => Hotel bien situado pero un poco anticuado  
P => magnifico  
P => Hotel de chaine typique  
P => un pesimo hotel

P => Dont take the bad reviews too seriously After reading the reviews online about this hotel anyone would think this is a horrible place to stay  The reality however is that it really isnt that bad My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by our experience here  If youre looking for a poshy place to stay this is not it  But if youre looking for hostel quality youll like it here just as we did  For such a low price for a room in Chicago this actually makes it a really good lodging option  
P => Milshire has character but not Ritzy This place does seem older but it has charcter like the Chelsea without all the famous guests  Being a tourist I did feel uncomfortable sleeping and I didnt like leaving the key at the desk when we left   We were attending a concert at the Double Door  
P => Disgusting When we got there we had to choose a room with a quotprivate bathquot  The receptionist is hidden behind a glass wall the announcements on the walls are written with a pen and she has to buzz you in to get into the hotel lobby  The place smells bad the elevator is probably the original s When we got to the room it took us  minutes to open the two locks  When we removed the cover sheet the linens were yellow and I mean spotted yellow  When I looked in a tray on the dresser which had our toilet paper a couple of cockroaches where running around in circles   When I opened the blinds which were dusty I couldnt see much outside because of the dust and mud that covered the windows  And also the windows are quotbeautifullyquotarranged with some blue duct tape  Now the bathroom  Full of cockroaches the shower is dripping and you cannot lock the bathroom window which overlooks a scary backyard  We stayed  minutes in the room and we took off checking out but not before noticing the red carpet with an inch of dust and some announcements that were letting you know not to run in the hallways or quotno going in other peoples roomsquot I encourage you to take a look at the rooms first and ignore the other preview 
P => Low budget and convenient My friend and I ided to stay here for one night to attend a concert at the Congress Theatre nite  The neighborhood is kind of rundown until you turn the corner and there are these lush posh areas  The location was convenient access to the busline and within  min walking distance to where we wanted to go  There were restaurants nearby but we did not choose to eat anywhere nearby  Safety at night  be an issue The onsite people were very nice and hospitable  The room we stayed in was tiny but sufficient for our needs  Bathroom had baby cockroaches didnt bother us as long as long as they werent bothering us  We brought our own sheets and blankets which I think should be a must if you or your traveling buddy is a neat sanitation freak  Rooms were equipped with a fridge and tv  Noise from the outside is loudly audible  While I slept through the night after the concert my friend could not deal with the upstairs neighbors yelling out the window from   AM the screeching cars the police sirens and the ongoing car alarms  I vaguely remember it thinking it was part of my dream  There is metered parking in front of the hotel and after pm there is free parking around the corner Overall ok experience but probably wouldnt stay there again unless it was very necessary  
P => 
P => Near Chicago hot spots I stayed at Oakwood for  months on business in Chicago and one could not ask for a better place  The staff was gracious and helpful  The room was bigger than my apt in Scottsdale  The views were spectacular  They had a great pool and workout room on the th floor  I had maid service wkly and they werent quite bright because they kept using a vacuum that didnt work  They let me bring my two cats with me which is an incredible advantage  It was within walking distance to Michigan Ave the El and some fantastic restaurants and bars  
P => Something for everyone I stayed at the Oakwood for  weeks on business  I couldn t have been happier with the experienceMy company booked this for me  I was looking for somewhere I could stay longer term but bring my dog the Oakwood is very pet friendly The location is beyond compare right in the heart of a fun part of Chicago and a short say  min on a bad day walk to where I worked in the Loop  It s also close to two subway stops The staff couldn t be friendlier or more helpful  They make an effort to get to know you and will bend over backwards to meet your needs My apartment was lovely  I stayed in a one bedroom which suited my needs just fine  The combined livingdining area was spacious furnished with a dining room table a little desk living room furniture consisting of sofa loveseat and endcoffee table along with a nice TV armoire  The bed I had was king size and the bedroom had a TV as well  There s an enormous closet in the bedroom in fact for what it is there s plenty of closetstorage in addition there s two closets in the other living area  The kitchen was quite fully furnished with dishes utensils and pots and pans all I would have hoped for that wasn t there was a pizza wheel with a full size fridge and stoverange and a dishwasher  A toaster and coffee maker are also there  My dishwasher did not seem to work well at all but I did not realize this until the end of my stay  My view overlooked the Hard Rock and Rainforest Cafes and the big Rock and Roll McDonalds with a view of the downtown part of the city beyond  It was a very cool nighttime view  Also notable the building is amazingly quiet it doesn t appear to have the standard thin hotel walls Housekeeping services were optional but my company sprung for weekly services  The housekeepers vacuumed cleaned the kitchen and bathroom and the bedroom as well when my dog was not there  They run all dirty dishes through the dishwasher  As mine worked poorly that just made more work for me but I am sure the Oakwood will remedy this now that they know it s broken There s no shortage of restaurants in the neighborhood and great ones at that  In addition Michigan Avenue is a short be   blocks walk and the lakefront is just a few blocks beyond that  Given the train stops that are so close you can easily get anywhere from the Oakwood  There is a parking garage attached to the Oakwood so if you drive your car is always conveniently nearby  They will issue you an access card so you can come and go easily You have to look for pet friendly outdoor locations for your dog to do what it has to do but they re around  Just a block over on Superior my dog was satisfied with a strip of mulch and grass  A little longer walk be   blocks and you re at Washington Square Park a lovely little oasis in the city and a great place to meet other dogs  I originally planned on jumping through the hoops to gain access to the city s  Dog Friendly Areas  but they were all just a little too far to be practical and used enough  The city street walking along with the close park turned out to be fine The th floor has an indoor pool terrace area with gas grill and patio furnishings meeting areas exercise room locker rooms and laundry facility pretty comprehensive perks that were very convenient The Oakwood tries to cater to everyone and succeeds I met people who were in town for a weekend vacation others like me in town for extended temporary work families making a temporary home there while they are in the midst of a relocation and people who resided there full time what an interesting mix and the Oakwood can suit them all  The Oakwood and its  staff helped make an unwanted extended work assignment into a positive any other work I have in Chicago I ll return to the Oakwood without question  
P => Great Home Away From Home Spent a month working in Chicago and the company booked this room for us  Very cozy comfortable well secured and friendly front desk  orated fairly nicely   the apartment had some personality to it and didnt feel like a chain hotel  Televisions were old and starting to get blurry and the one in the bedroom didnt work at all we didnt care though   the one in the living room worked  Exercise room was small  Within walking distance of several nice bars and restaurants and Whole Foods  
P => Oakwood Chicago great stay great price Stayed at the Oakwood Apts in Chicago and couldnt have had better at the price I got  bed bath fully furnished heated pool sauna the works located next to Hard Rock cafe close to house of blues and only four blocks from Michagan Ave  Cant beat it and the staff was great told me of some great eating spots  Thanks again for the great stay Vito and Crystal 
P => Perfect for the Price This turned out to be perfect for our girls trip to Chicago  Very close to shopping and restaurants  We had two large bedrooms two bathrooms a living area and a kitchen  Since there was a Whole Foods around the corner we were able to stock up on breakfast and snack supplies  The front desk was very helpful with recommendations and directions  This is normally used as corporate housing so things seem a little different than a traditional hotel  Furniture was a little worn but linens were very nice  There were TVs and extra towels in each room and the kitchen was stocked with cookware  The price was about  less than an other hotels in the area and we loved the extra space  
P => Great furnished apartment Stayed here for one week while visiting Chicago  It was wonderful to have a fully furnished apartment rather than a cramped hotel room  The location is unbelievable and the staff is super friendly  Would highly recommend  
P => 
P => Good Place to Stay If you want a place to stay downtown Chicago with a reasonable price Ohio House Motel is perfect match for that purpose  
P => Basic accomodation free parking great location  My boyfriend and I stayed here last  when we came up to visit our friend in the Navy  It wasnt bad  It was clean and located right in the city which is excellent for us as we walk everywhere  It was alittle over priced but the location was unbeatable and they offered free ample parking  Theres a mcdonalds right next door an onsite dinnercoffee house and a great superket just around the corner  Id reccomend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a basic no frills place to pass the night  
P => Not great but not bad We stayed here two nights and didnt sleep either  There was a lot of comings and goings round the back with blasting steroes at am on a Monday morning which didnt help  The windows shook and it didnt feel particuatly safe The hotel is basic its clean enough but didnt have the rustic charm others seem to think it has  What it does have is location and you cant beat it for that  Very central and cheap with the free parking an added bonus  I wouldnt go back but if youre on a budget then this place isnt the worst you could find  It has a cafe attached and is next to the McDonalds featured in the Eagle Eye movie next door which is handy for breakfast  
P => A Basic Room at an Awesome Value and Close to downtown I had read many reviews of this place and had mixed feelings  I booked anyway  Im so glad I did The room is an EXCELLENT value when compared to the other hotels  For example the Best Western across the street was over   per night  I stayed in room  and it cost me with taxes    The room was very very clean but small and very few amenities  The room is only good for bathing and sleeping which is all I need  I posted some images as well  The hotel is right on the corner of Ohio and N  LaSalle St  Across LaSalle and down about  block is an enormous two story absolutely incredible  story McDonald where we had breakfast and free WiFi BluesJazz Music a lounge upstairs and amazing views  The McDs is open  hours which seemed to cause problems for some but the McD is so far away across a major  lane street and about  way down the block and surrounded by trees it never bothered me  You gotta visit this place even if its just for a cup of coffee    well worh the visit  Across the street   the photo I show is out my room window is a restaurantbar  Some folks on this forum complained about noise but I experienced NONE  be if your from Kansas and you are used to absolute quite it might be somewhat noisy but I heard nothing and I live in wooden suburbia  Absolutely no noise at all  Check out the room images  Like I said its just for sleeping but extremely clean I must say  The bed was kinda not soft hard to explain but for me not a problem  Check out the images and feel free to contact me  Oh if you go about two blocks away is Ginos Deep Dish Pizza   a Chicago Original since   The front desk recommended them and Im so glad I went Absolutely delicious and plenty of food  
P => Vintage jem in the heart of the windy city My husband and I stayed at the Ohio House Motel in  when we met friends in Chicago for a Cubs game and mini college reunion  In many ways you get what you pay for at the Ohio House its clean and basic  The towels are somewhat scratchy and the furnishings somewhat dated though I prefer to think of them as vintage  Staying at the Ohio House is a little like stepping back in time to the days when families traveled down Route  for vacations  That said you wont find a better deal in downtown Chicago  The parking is free and that was a huge plus for my husband and I as parking in the city can be very expensive  The staff is very helpful and the restaurant has an amazing and cheap breakfast that really hits the spot after a long night out  
P => Cheapest I could find in the city  Free parking and good location  Good enough for what I needed  I didnt want anything fancy and overpriced  Stayed  nights with no problems  Not the greatest but it was fine and I never saw any bugs  The people on the streets and car horns can get annoying though  
P => Exactly what you need if youre staying downtown We had tickets to House of Blues one night and instead of paying too much for something we really didnt need we found this place  Honestly if youre staying directly downtown Chi town what do you really need besides a bed and free parking  Room was in good shape pretty much just a bed and dresser  Bathroom apparently was clean enough because one of the friends we went with got drunk and passed out while bathing All in all good little find everything downtown is in walking distance Make sure you go walk downtown late at night and watch rats the size of dogs play in the street  
P => location location location basic budget hotel in a fantastic location for access to bars cafes shops etc  large rooms and friendly staff and a bargain if you dont mind not having the lil extras like coffee makers shampoo etc  
P => Bug Good location  Room is small  You gotta pay for internet access  The worst is i got bitten by bed bugs Will never go back again 
P => Flea Bag motel Oh geez where do I begin  The only good thing I can say is Great location  This place was the worst in every other way  First off the furnishings are literally garbage   The table lamp in our room had black electrical tape wrapped around the center   The box springs have springs protruding and stains all over them Some kind of red stain on the carpetthe wallpaper is coming off the wall  If that wasnt bad enough the people in the room next door were animals and fought and screamed all night untill  in the morning Of course I wasnt going to sleep anywaythe bed was ready for the k heap   I expected this place to be clean and be a little dated from the reviews I had read BUT ITS MUCH WORSE THAN THAT   Folks its not worth the few bucks you save   Go to priceline and get a room at the Hilton for about   more  This place was a DUMP    
P => Great Motel in downtown Chicago I stayed at this motel with  other girlfriends and we loved it  When we first pulled up we were a little nervous about it  Before we went in we called the Best Western across the street and they were  where the Ohio House was  and it didnt really look any better then the Ohio House  We ran into a few ladies just leaving their rooms and they told us to stay because the rooms were good and clean  They even let us in to look and we were happy with them  We stayed for a weekend and were so happy we stayed there  The rooms are not fancy but they were clean and I cant say enough about the location it is close to Michigan Ave only about  blocks a quick   minute walk and one of the train stations is over one street on Grand very close  Other friends with us had booked on Michigan ave at the Congress and it was way down on S Michigan a very long walk and about  more  The beds were great and the shower was nice and hot  There is a sports bar across the street and it was a little loud on Friday and Saturday night around   am although only one friend was awakenend by the noise where the other two of us slept fine and didnt hear a thing  She said it wasnt all that loud and she was able to get right back to sleep  Not a big deal because you are in heart of the city so you hear horns and such anyway  Believe me when youre in the city I dont know why youd waste lots of money paying for a room that youre only going to be in to change shower and sleep theres too much to see and do for hanging in a motel room  Anyway the staff was great  We couldnt ask for anything better they were very friendly and nice  One night at am we couldnt get the cable to work and the older night deskman came up to get it working for us super nice man  We were really happy with the way you enter your rooms too  There is different sections A B C etc and you have to use your key to enter into the hallway then theres a downstairs with  rooms and an upstairs with  rooms so its great cause its really safe and the doors to your rooms are not opening to the outside like the pictures on the wewbsite look like  Its worth it to stay here because of the location and price  We are definitely staying here when we come back to Chicago  
P => Location Cheap free parking clean enough  Location is north of the river great accessibility for all central parts of town  Free parking if your staying no valet no cost which is amazing for this location  the cheapest place we stayed  Rooms are basic and wifi costs a little extra  But the rooms are clean enough with some quaint orative items in the room  Some would call them old i like to see them as eccetric if your doing Chicago on a strict budget keep this motel and number in mind  You will save money on the other hotels in central locations Highly recommended  
P => enjoyed my stay I stayed at this motel for a whole week while I had some meetings at downtown  While booking the motel I was a little bit worried because it wasnt a chain motel and some reviews reported noise  This is why I asked in advance a quite room at the second floor  When getting there I was surprised to see a very nice and clean motel very good maintenance a comfortable room and a reated bathroom  The desk clerks were very professional and kind  The location was good in a walking distance from most of the downtown attractions  The surrounding has a lot of restaurants and fast food places  To make it short  I was very content with my selection of this motel which offer a very good value for its price  
P => A gem What a fabulous find  We booked on the strength of the reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed This place is a real gem for the budget price  You cant go wrong We were in the States for  weeks and drove from Rochester MN to Chic  Parking is free and that is a huge bonus in downtown Chic Loved the location  Everything is within walking distance and there are an abundance of restaurants around  Ask the receptionist to recommend a traditional Chicago pizza place  You wont be disappointed  We were in for a shock  Portions were huge 
P => Great Motel I just can recommend this place My boyfriend and I stayed here for  nights and we had a great time  Nice clean room and a very clean bathroom Just the nightclub on the otherside of the road was a bit noisy 
P => Greatest deal Ive stayed at the Ohio House motel twice  I really love this place  Its clean its very no frills but what do you need The location is excellent although surrounded by sports bars so yes there are bound to be some yahoos It has a delightful little wisp of a diner  stools and  booths be with excellent french toast  The people who work in the office are very very helpful I have to say I might have enjoyed my stay this year a little less than last year  the air conditioning this year didnt seem as magical as last year and theyre redoing the rooms and getting rid of the s furniture that Ill admit I was really charmed by last year  Now its been replaced by pine boards  
P => th anniversary night Well be back again Hubby and I met in the city to celebrate our th anniversary  We had gotten tickets to see Sweeney Todd at the Cadillac Palace Theater fantastic by the way Had dinner at the Italian Village and went to the show  We figured that we would want to relax after our evening of dinner and theater so hubby assigned me the task of finding a place to stay  Now we have stayed in most of the larger hotels downtown at one time or another  We both worked in the Time Life building for ades  Chicago has some lovely old and new hotels  Many now are cookie cutters of each other but still others are standouts  The recent renewing of the loop by converting some of the old sky scrapes to boutique hotels is fantastic    but what of the old  lane highway variety lodging The reliable mom and pop motel room with snappy clean sheets postcards in the desk drawer good water pressure a flickering television to keep you company   and a comfy diner within walking distance that could provide you with a tasty breakfast and a cup of joe to get you on your way Look no further than the Ohio House Wont cost you a Kings ransom eitherWe had a wonderful evening and a great nights sleep We were pleasantly suprised by the lovely little room we stayed in I think it was   We will definately stay at the Ohio House again  The parking was free and secure  The desk man was very nice we were early   no problem  The housekeepers were very friendly and did a great job keeping the rooms clean  We were able to walk from the theater to our motel  We had a relaxing and romantic evening By the way    all the reviewers complaining about noise must have been out on the prairie for too long This is downtown Chicago  You know    Frank sang about it Al Capone used to rule the streets to the dis of the law but to the delight of the masses What about Dillenger Probably the only noise he regretted hearing was the quotBANGquot outside the Biograph  The Cubs havent won anything in  years there Chicago is bound to make a little noise over that dont you think All I am trying to say is that we were not bothered by any noise during our stay  We had the windows open all night and I didnt hear a thing  Im not a city dweller either    I was raised on a farm and we now live in a very small and quiet town   Thank you Ohio House 
P => Great Budget Accomodation in the heart of the city We stayed at the Ohio House last weekend on a three day stay in Chicago  Being a fairly expensive city budget accomodation was something we needed and the Ohio House provided The Ohio House is located close to the heart of the city a few blocks back from Michigan Avenue  The rooms are small to average size bathrooms average hotel size with very s style appearence and or  Most people tend to assume that budget accomodation in an expensive city means hygiene problems however the Ohio House we found to be was extremely clean  stars in that department  The Motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there  Its was nice but again very s style which was interesting  Chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though   my personal recommendation is a little French style cafe Cosi a block or so back from Michigan Avenue  The Ohio House is also directly across the road from a large McDonalds not that youd go all the way to Chicago just to eat McDonaldsThere was only one issue we had with the Ohio House and that was the noise from the streets at night  But the Ohio House is a very clean comfortable stay for anyone wishing to take a budget holiday in Chicago   which was a beautiful city  Personally I would stay there again if I was looking for budget accomodation   but should there be available funds I would probably choose to stay in one of the larger hotels in the City  
P => Perfect for what we needed Ohio House Motel is an inexpensive oasis in the middle of an expensive city  We wanted to stay in the middle of the city close enough to walk to major attractions restaurants and bars  Ohio House was perfect for that Several eateries in the immediate vicinity of Ohio House were great  I sit here drooling over memories of eating Chicagos deep dish pizza as we speak Mag mile was an easy  minute walk and we found that we had no problems getting around on foot  The furthest we had to walk was to Soldier Stadium around  minutes away  The accomodation was basic but clean  it is what it is   a ent motel smack bang in the middle of a big city  House keeping did a really good job each day and we would look forward to a comfortable bed after a long day exploring a really nice city  We stayed for  days and the only thing I would have liked to have had access to for that period of time was a small refridgerator  Air conditioning worked well showers were always hot and for people with a car needing to stay in the city it is perfect with a parking lot in front of the property  Motel staff were always nice and helpful enough without being overly friendly or personal  We stayed at this hotel from the th e   th y  and were able to go to the Taste of Chicago and experience the rdth and th of y fireworks  What a great time to visitA couple of small notes   The rooms are right next to a major street with an all night mcdonalds next door and a night club across the road  It didnt really bother us we had no problems sleeping but for very light sleepers it  be an issue  People used to large hotels in cities where your room is far from the entrance to the building and any passersby  not appreciate people being able to walk right by your room on the street Though with two security locked doors between us and the outside we never felt unsafe or uneasy at any time Also check out the large sports store  Sports Authority next door to the motel  With a great bargain basement and seven stories of sporting goods my boyfriend was in heaven  I think that people from overseas will especially appreciate the huge store as I know we dont have anything like it at homeWe stayed at this hotel from the th e   th y  and were able to go to the Taste of Chicago and experience the rdth and th of y fireworks  What a great time to visitAll in all I would be happy to stay here again if we ever get the chance to visit this great city another time  
P => Great Location and cheap free parking and clean We would definitely stay there the next time we go to Chicago Yesits old and outdated inside but it is clean and the rooms are spacious  The location is walking distance to EVERYTHING We went for the weekend to see the quotJersey Boysquot and could even walk to the theatre  We walked to the Mag  mile the loop all over   and the parking is free your car is right there if you need something from your car you dont need to find it in a parking garage  Only negative we had it is noisy at night you hear everything going on outside but the bed was comfortable and we did get enough sleep  Will stay there again  The hotel across the street was double the price  Try it its worth it if you plan on seeing Chicago and justwant to sleep and shower 
P => Great value What you need to bare in mind about this motel is that you are paying    a night to stay in central Chicago  Yes it is a basic motel but in my experience its clean secure has cable and its   a night Theres a subway station about a  minute walk away and the worlds biggest McDonalds opposite  Whatever you  think about McDonalds at least it means taxis know exactly where youre staying If youre on a budget like we were then its definitely a place to stay  Try and get a room that faces into the courtyard as the back rooms can be noisy  And if youre in Chicago take a boat tour  yes its touristy but youll get amazing photo opportunities 
P => Excellent budget accommodation Stayed here for  nights in t   The room was very clean and bed really comfortable  Shower was great but other plumbing was a bit erratic  My room faced the alleyway at the back and the early morning garbage trucks were a bit noisy  My friends room faced the parking lot which was much quieter so it might be better to request one of those rooms  The diner attached to the motel was fantastic   great breakfasts and terrific value and the lady owner is a real sweetheart The location could not be better with public transport within a couple of blocks and plenty of great bars and restaurants within walking distance  The wi fi which you have to pay for was also a bit hit and miss   did not work in my room but worked OK in my friends  All in all a great choice for those on a budget who want to be close to the loop  I would stay here again  
P => Great value and super local I stayed at this property back in mid y for a couple nights  This trip to Chicago was a bday present to myself but I was on a super tight budget when it came to hotels  I had seen this hotel back in  on a previous trip and ided to check it out  Man am I glad I did cause the rates for the rooms are more then worth it  I will admit that the weekend noise from the club across the street can be much and the rooms are in need of some new furnishings but over all the room was clean bed not too bad and those were the two things that I was looking for  Public transport is only a couple blocks away as is Portillos  Next time I am in Chicago and want to stay downtown I will give the hotel another shot just for the price alone  
P => Average Rooms Good Location My boyfriend amp I stayed at this motel for  nights in e  We found it to be of average quality but in a good location close to the city centre amp transport  It takes about  minutes to get from Chicago Miday Airport to the motel via the l train  There is a car park for guests amp the motel is across the road from the largest McDonalds in the USA  There are many restaurants clubs amp bars in the close vicinity with the Magnificent Mile amp other shopping generally about a  minute walk away  The room was fairly spacious but had a funny smell  It was in need of renation really but in general it was definitely passable as a central city motel  The shower was pretty good with plenty of hot water  There was also HBO I think  Dont stay here if you are looking for hotel class accommodation   in the end you get what you pay for but this motel was satisfactory  We stayed in a room close to the road the motel is near a large intersection but werent too bothered by the traffic noise  There is wi fi at the motel amp the proprieters let us leave our luggage after check out which was nice   both the gentlemen we met there were really helpful amp friendly  The neighbourhood didnt seem the safest but it wasnt scary either The only real downside was the delivery trucks that kept parking in the alleyway next to our room in the early hours of each morning where they would create quite a racket   it might be better to request a room away from the streetsalleyways if you are a light sleeper  There is no breakfast served here amp the cafe on the corner is not really worth it its small dingy amp greasy   not in a good way so save your pennies amp venture further afield for something a lot nicer  There is a superket not too far away as well if you are on a budget  And Giordanos deep dish pizza or Pizzeria Uno amp Ginos are to die for amp not far away if youre not worried about your waistlineOverall this hotel is a little shabby around the edges but is certainly up to scratch value wise  Enjoy your stay 
P => Best price in town but expect some discomfort I stayed at the hotel together with my girlfriend during a weekend trip to Chicago  The hotel is probably the cheapest accomendation in downtown Chicago but you have to expect some discomfort when you go there  The room and bed where okay but the windows where pretty thin compared to the typical situation in Germany so you hear pretty much everything whats going on outside  Our window was towards the back side of a huge department store and there where noisy fans running all night long  Besides that you hear a lot from the big crossing next to the hotel and people in Chicago really like to use their horn  On the other side you have free parking and other hotels in downtown are  bucks up   Enjoy your staykus 
P => Great locale and good for the price What an amazing spot Chicago was the last stop on a  week tour of the US and this motel couldnt have been better located  A little slice of history too and quite adequate for the price  Was clean safe and central AND had free parking  We ejoyed our stay here  Its not the Ritz but you wouldnt find a better located hostel for that price  I really dont knowwhat some people here are expecting   its a MOTEL 
P => its right in the middle of everything The hotel itself is fairly mediocre but itis right in the middle of everythingESPN Cafe Rock and Roll McDonaldsHard Rock Pizza Unoss are all close by Miracle Mile and State Street are only afew blocks away  One night I got intotown late and had to stay at a realdive the Tokyo House  YeecH Thisplace is nowhere near that bad has a nice little diner next door as wellas free parking  Compare this with theBest Western across the street which istwice as expensive Excellent for studenttravelers or others on a budget  
P => another nice stay stayed here several times in the past and was in town this weekend    before going to work in indianapolis for  weeks  gotta love the free parking and the close proximity to everything chicago  while it is a motel past its prime they now have wireless internet in the room  it is loud if you get a room on the side where the main road is ask for a room on the backside  
P => You get what you pay for night for a queen room plus free parking in an attached lot is pretty much unheard of anywhere in the city limits of Chicago  So you have to be a little suspicious going into it  We kept our expectations low and ended up satisfied with what we got  For the price we knew we werent going to have lavish or and plush linens  The rooms are spartan and no frills but they are clean and adequately sized  The bathrooms have small bars of soap but no other toiletries so be prepared and bring your own  If youre a light sleeper this  not be the place to stay  Street traffic can be heard at all hours as well as the bass beat of the music playing at the club across the street  We brought a travel fan and it helped drown out a lot of the extraneous noise late at night For the location and the price the Ohio House is hard to beat  Just be realistic about your expectations and remember that you get what you pay for  
P => Weird little place with awesome staff Youd be surprised to find a place like that downtown Chicago  It has no website and is not featured on Travelocity and the likes as far as I know  I found it in the Lonely Planet Chicago in the budget section after failing miserably at booking any other place for the Chicago athon  Everything was booked  months in advanced except for  and up luxury suites  This place still cost  which would buy you a ent room on a day other than the day before the athon but I think prices a much lower the rest of the time Anyway when it says quotMotelquot it IS a motel  Straight out of the s  It is not just retro themed it is truly retro so if you like that sort of thing go for it  I still am not completely sure what that gadget that reminded of an old record playerradio it wasnt a record player in the corner was but artifacts like that ceased to exist at least  years ago  The place was really worn out but with a remodeled bathroom  The sheets and blankets must have been on those beds for generations  It was clean although still looked kind of sketchy the kind of place that would be featured in the noir film  Customer service was excellent The gentleman who helped us check in was one of the most pleasant people Ive ever met and that is the reason why I didnt hate the motel  You cant hate a place where such wonderful people work  We also needed some help the next day and the day shift woman was also great I would recommend this motel for people on a tight budget who dont care for frills  
P => What Can You Expect My girlfriend and I stayed here for the weekend to see a Bears game  If you want a fancy hotel then pay the money and stay at one  But if you an ok room at a cheap price then this it  Area was nice   No problems with the locals  Within walking distance to what downtown Chicago has to offer  Our room was ok  except for the adult magazines and McDonalds garbage that was left in one of the drawers  Their was no bugs and you cant beat the free onsite parking  I would stay here again  
P => Very satisfactory great price We stayed for four nights in   Comfortable room plenty of space clean everything worked  No problem with noise at night  Helpful and courteous staff  Would confidently recommend this to any normal tourist  Very good value   plus tax  
P => Perfect for Thrifty Night Owls If you have a car and you want to stay downtown the Ohio House  be the best choice  When you factor in what the other budget hotels charge for parking the Ohio House is about the cheapest respectable lodging place downtown  Plus you can look out your window and actually see your vehicle in the parking lot  I dont like the idea of having my car in a public garage out of my sight as is the situation at the other cheap hotels  My only problem with the OH was noise  I stayed in the room above the office   the quietest in the motel   but it was still kind of noisy  Car stereos were the problem     Ohio amp LaSalle is a busy intersection  The guy who thought of putting subwoofers in car stereos ought to be doing time in prison for crimes against humanity  The traffic didnt die down until  am  And I was there on a quiet night   the disco across the street was closed  The room was clean by the standards of budget motels and fairly spacious  
P => never again After visiting Chicago for the day we ided to spend the night  After trying to get into several other motels with no luckno available roomsneeded a credit cardOhio house gave us a rooma single dirty room with two beds for    Also if you plan on sleeping dont forget your ear plugs or you will be sorry There is a dance club across the street that closes at  am  Also the constant honking of taxi cabs ALL night long was awful  However were grateful we didnt have to sleep in our car  
P => AMAZING Wow You simply wont find a better deal in Chicago  For a very reasonable fare under night even with taxes you get a fantastic location very safe environment clean and reasonably sized room and cheap food at the diner  I was able to walk to the Sears Tower from my room granted it was quite a stroll but still  and it was pretty accessible to the subway  And the parking is free I have zero complaints about the Ohio House  None  If I end up back in Chicago itll be the first place I call    if some chain hasnt tried to put a tower on top of it by then  
P => Great Price While its been some years since Ive stayed at the Ohio House I did have a great time in Chicago  I have recommended this place to several people since  The room and bathroom are a little dated but very clean amp NO BUGS  Most people go to Chicago for all that the City has to offer so your hotel room is really for sleeping and showering  Why spend the big dollars on a room you will only be in for be   hours Not to mention the free parking right outside your door  Give it a try you wont regret it  Dont forget to go to the Coffee Shop for breakfast  
P => Great price great location Stayed there y    place looks very retro and the little cafe looks like it is out of the s  Rooms clean and spacious cafe is cheap and standard diner  All major attractions downtown are within walking distance and the bus to wrigley Field is  blocks away hard rock Cafe  block Spot of Trumps new building is  mile or so away  The Rock and roll McDonalds is across street but is being rebuilt and will not open until   Free Trolley to Navy Pier is  blocks away  The area is really clean and I did not see any hustlers hookers or drug dealers  Any other hotel in area starts at  Great value great location I cant believe some chain has not bought this place out  Free parking a plus as some hotels in the area charge for parking in addition to the expensive room  There is no pool but the beach is about two miles away  
P => It works for me Granted its more quirky than quaint more plain than plush  But the Ohio House is a great value  The location is awesome you cant beat the price you can park right in front of your door and there are usually rooms available  It  not be grand but it is clean and I will stay there often 
P => Super stay We stayed in the room above the check in office which has one full wall of window   it was great Very clean bright and comfortable  Nothing fancy but perfect for the budgeting traveller  Free parking a bonus   and the Ohio Hose cafe had good cheap breakfasts  Will stay here anytime I go to Chicago  
P => Best location for the price This is hands down the best location in Chicago for the price  It is the only place we stay when we go to Chicago on a budget  The rooms are basic and nothing fancy but have always been clean especially the bathrooms  We have never been bothered by transients or prostitutes  It is a very busy corner and have always felt sazfe there  Free off street parking is also a huge plus  
P => Cant beat the price Straight out of the s  Nothing fancy nothing extra  It was clean and we didnt see any bugs or prostitues  For the location and price it cant be beat   
P => Cant Beat It    I stayed at the Ohio House back in the s and it was around night so when I wanted to go  I was afraid of what the pricing would be  I paid night for a busy Chicago weekend   the hotels DIRECTLY across the street and down the block were asking night  All I did was watch an hour of TV and crashed   took a shower the next morning and left  I cant see paying for a lap of luxury in the hotel when there are so many places and things to do up there The rooms are clean and unlike Motel  you get your choice of shower or bathI am going to stay at Ohio House anytime I go for more than a one day stay  
P => A Bed and a Bathroom A very basic no frills motel with free parking in a lot outside the motel  Very interesting variety of customers  Good amp fast food in adjacent coffee shop   if you can find an open seat 
P => Its great This is the best place to stay in Chicago for the price  The location on where it is the greatest  It is clean and where else in Chicago has free parking 
P => ent place for a ent price Ive stayed in the Ohio House a few times over the past few years  Its a ent place for a ent price with free parking  Its pretty clean and while the furniture isnt brand new its really close to all the good spots and its on the quotgoodquot side of them all  Its a little noisy at night but HEY   ITS DOWNTOWN  The blocks on the far side of the motel from Michigan Ave seem a bit dicey but theres really no reason to go there at night anyway  I didnt see any hookers there but to be honest I wasnt looking either  If you want the Hilton then stay at the Hilton  Just get ready to pay  or more a night plus  for parking daily  If you want a ent price with a great location this is a relatively good place  It also has a very convenient little b fast place that has good though not too health conscious food  Enough bang for your buck for my weekend anyway  
P => Honda Hotel What a HOLE  The service stinks and so do the rooms  I recommend sleeping in your car  
P => Ohio House My husband and I stayed at the Ohio house while we were on our week long honeymoon  We stayed in one of the suites above the coffee shop  It was VERY clean and had a kitchenette and everything  We were over joyed with the service we had the most delicious breakfast everyday at the coffee shop  Its also close to most every attraction in the city  We loved the Ohio House and will stay there every year for our anniversary P S  We didnt see any vagrants or prostitutes either 
P => What a Dump Go anywhere else unless you want to be surrounded by transients and prostitutes  
P => Sorprende  
P => posizione eccezionale  
P => 
P => Really great hotel in a super location Our family just returned from a three night stay at the Omni  The Omni is a really nice suite style hotel  The suite was very clean and simply orated  Having the two rooms with actual doors that closed between the rooms was very handy  We never felt on top of one another  We went to the hotel restaurant  which was great  All of the staff   front desk bell staff concierge housekeeping just couldnt have been friendlier  Honestly that was probably the nicest part of the hotel  I voted the value down a little bit because the cost of valet parking was so high at night  Its been a couple of years since we were in Chicago   but  seems pretty high  One thing that I would vote to change if anyone asked   add another kid friendly channel Disney Channel or Cartoon Disney to the cable TV line up  Sometimes Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon arent very appealing to the younger kids  We love Chicago and the kids are already asking when we can go back  So much to do   so little time 
P => Yet another Good Omni experience   though rooms almost dated  Having enjoyed Omni stays in LA Dallas and New Orleans it was an easy ision to book and get the Amex weekend arrival rate for  per night  A reasonable deal in that useful place to base   the part of town on North Michigan where all the usual bland upscale stuff are the neighbours Nordstrom and so on  To enter the hotel you take an elevator from ground level to floor three where there is check in  Right from the off it was the good Omni service thing polite and friendly people who keep their individuality   they seem to select people for who they are rather than turn them into customer fearing smiling robots  And I like that  I asked for and got a slight upgrade to a corner room  Join their Select Guest programme and all this stuff is easy to sort out   and it also gets you free wifi and an item of clothing pressed for free as well as a daily bland morning juice from concentrate and a newspaper  Except the no point to it watered juice its all very useful The place is all suites  And the first impression of the room was good   clean well appointed coffeetea maker DVD player two TVs desk sofa bed CD playing alarm clock but it felt like the bed was in the wrong place  And the ceiling felt low  I felt a bit like I was in a garage  A comfortable garage though  Nice fabrics clean comfortable bed ent linens all the usual stuff   ble bathroom and nice lighting throughout Anyway I got to like the suite with its arating doors between the bedroom and studysofamini kitchen area as I was there for a week   My only two reservations firstly I could hear the conversation in neighbouring rooms absolutely clearly through the walls and adjoining doors  The way to fix that was to close all the doors to the bedroom and the noise levels were much better  Secondly the layout feels dated  Not the fabrics but subtle things like the doors and the layout But then hand in hand with the architectural layout being dated the great thing is that the windows open  And to me that is a mega bonus  The chance to clear out the room cleaning chemicals as well as get a breeze was perfect  So you cannot have everything The Omni was perfect for my needs which was to be in the room quite a lot working on the laptop and heading out a lot by cab into different neighbourhoods in the day and evening  And so the location is ideal but then all the big ones there are ideal too as it is half an hour south to Hyde Park and the Southside and all that and more or less equidistant to Lakeview to the bars and stuff like Kingston Mines to the Theaters like Steppenwolf and all that  I visited the gym on floor  twice  And like the rooms the place is just looking as if it is a tiny tiny bit tired and ready for reation  Its nothing serious  There were enough running and cross training machines for everyone while I was there and there are also a couple of balls some freeweights  I didnt use the pool or the restaurant but had room service dinner one evening which was an OK chicken casear salad  Nothing extraordinary  Nearby you have deep dish pizza restaurants a lot of them and I tried Giordanos and it was fine  There is also a Trader Joes and a useful Whole Foods with buffet salads pizza slices and other bits a few blocks away on the same street  And its five minutes walk to the Hanckock building with its fantastic view  And theres a Cheesecake Factory at the base of the same building so thats a bonus of sorts  
P => Great value on Michigan Avenue Great location and great value  The lobby and common areas are very nice  I had a deluxe room which was excellent  The bedding was terrific and the room had every amenity I would want  The front desk staff was ent but not great  The bell staff was wonderful  polite efficient and helpful The room service was some of the best I have experienced  
P => The Perfect Hotel This hotel is absolutely beautiful They even upgraded upon arrival Loved the wetbar and snacks in the suite I will definitely be staying here again 
P => Great Hotel Just like the other OMNIs Ive stayed at   NY and LA   the Omni Chicago is top notch The staff was wonderful and the room was awesome  Very spacious clean and comfortable  Plus I cant say enough about the OMNI pref guest program  Even the restaurant wasnt bad  Plus the location cant be beat  Its within walking distance of everything 
P => Omni Has It All I planned a surprise trip to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary and my husbands birthday  I spent HOURS researching hotels so many to choose from and am so glad we ended up at the Omni  The location is ideal we were given a corner suite on the th top floor and the staff took excellent care of us  There was a discrepancy in what the hotel showed as our rate and what came through on an e mail from centralized reservations and Mohammed and Jewel at the front desk graciously honored the lesser amount  The Omnis Select Guest Program is true keting genius  It was so nice to return to our room each morning from the fitness center and have coffee juice and our favorite newspaper waiting for us  We stopped by the Concierge Desk several times and found everyone very helpful  The Omni does a great job of offering all the perks of a large glitzy hotel but with the personalized service of a smaller boutique type property  Jared printed our boarding passes when we were computer challenged and Jennifer generously had a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us when we arrived  We now consider ourselves Omni quotgroupiesquot and changed our hotel to the Omni Parker House when we visit our dhter next month for Thanksgiving  We are also going to stay at the Omni San Francisco when we stay overnight in the city in a few weeks  
P => THE BEST HOTEL IN CHICAGO What can I say Each time I stay at the Omni Chicago I think to myself quotWOW it cant get any better than this quot And it DOES We celebrated our st wedding anniversary at the Hotel  When the staff found out they sent up some very very nice surprises for us  We were just spoiled rotten the whole time we were there  We were treated like royalty We stayed in one of the Governors Suites  It was very spacious very clean and tastefully orated  All rooms are suites with a TV in the living room and one in the bedroom  The Omni is right on Michigan Avenue where you are just steps away from shopping and restaurants  As a Select Guest Member my husband and I received a pot of coffee juice and newspaper each morning at the time chosen by us  If you choose to stay at the Omni you might want to consider joining their Select Guest Program  It is free and there are so many amenities included  You get your choice of high floorlow floor near the elevatoraway from the elevator and so much more When I joined I received a   off coupon for a weekend stay  I also received another coupon for an upgrade  And of course you receive the coffee juice and newspaper delivered to your door in the morning at no charge  I want to thank the whole staff at the Omni Chicago for making our stay so perfect Youre the best 
P => Great location  Service just ok  My husband and I booked a romantic getaway for my birthday  With six kids it has been nearly ten years since we had a weekend to ourselves  My husband called the hotel ahead of time to ask about doing something special for me like wine or flowers  Two different employees couldnt help and repeatedly put him on hold until he eventually hung up  His secretary called back the next day and she had more success but the hotel didnt fulfill its promises The location is terrific very convenient  The room was nice but you still could hear city traffic on the rd floor  I used to live in Chicago so that doesnt really bother me  What was troublesome were the loud and drunk guests slamming doors and cursing in the hallway for a couple of hours in the middle of the night  I called the front desk and security did make a cursory visit to the rowdy rooms  He did not come back and check to see if the groups had quieted down they didnt for some time  In addition a room service waiter was up an down the floor at least three times during their craziness  He didnt ask them to quiet down or contact the front desk  I would say that the Omni failed to deliver on its promise of zero tolerance for disturbing the guests  I wouldnt go back  
P => Service location smiles This hotel is in an excellent location in the middle of shopping and close to things of interest like John Hancock observatory Navy Pier etc  Right on bus line and a few blocks from nearest train metro station  Restaurants shopping everywhere  The most noticable aspect of this hotel is the staff  Every single staff member we encountered greated us with a smile and a willingness to help no matter what  We had signed up for select guest status before arrival and the select guest coordinator met us upon check in and escorted us to our room to make sure everything we requested was there  We mentioned it was our anniversary and the coordinator later delivered champagne and chocolate covered strawberrys to our room I think that any guest at this hotel will be treated with the same level of service and courtesy by all staff members regardless of whether or not you signed up as a select guest which really makes the stay enjoyable  We had a corner suite which had a great wrap around view on the st floor  Highly recommend this type of room  Bed was extermely comfortable  One note though there is a trauma center nearby so you can hear emergency vehicles on occasion  I will say that if you want to stay in the heart of the action that noise from the street and traffic shouldnt be a suprise  Its part of the excitement of a big city at least in my opinion  We ate at Devon seafood Rosebud italian Bistro  french and quotRLquot steaks all close by within walking distance  Would recommend every one 
P => LOCATION     LOCATION     LOCATION I just returned from a trip to the city with my  year old dhter and her friends  The staff at Omni was wonderful and the location is fabulous  We were able to walk to shopping and dining  We went to Zombie Fest on Navy Pier and watched the fireworks on Saturday night  A great time was had by all  
P => Excellent Great staff  Excellent room large with a nice bathroom  Perfect location  Will definitely come back  
P => Excellent Customer Service and Accomodations My husband and I stayed in a suite with another couple for his birthday  The suite was spacious modern comfortable and clean  The big bathroom was a plus and I loved the travertine tiles I think on the tub wallsfloors The location is perfect  Close to everything  We never paid for one taxi ride used our car because everything was within walking distance or we took the train  I also loved the valet parking  It made checking inout so easy in the heart of downtown Its the customer service that really sets this hotel above the rest  From the bell boy to the person that answered the telephone upon check out we encountered knowledgeable friendly staff that seemed like they enjoyed making our stay wonderful  A special thank you to the staff members Katie and  that sent the adent chocolate dessert to my husband for his birthday  Its those little things that go a long way  
P => Location Location Location I took my mom to The Omni Hotel in Chicago  It is in the heart of Michigan Avenue If you are a shopper and want to have THE BEST location for the Magnificent Mile THIS is the place to stay You can easily walk to either end of Michigan Ave from this location  Right across the street was The Apple Store Garmin Nike Town down a block was American Girl Place Neiman cus plus a million other stores  The other way was Nordstrom Grand Luxe Cafe HampM    a million more shops  We were there  days and I TRIED to get to all of them but couldnt do it be if I stayed a month Our room was nice and clean but the first morning I was awakened by heavy excavating equipment building a hotel next door  Be sure you ask for a room on the opposite side of the building We were happily moved and all was right with the world  Everyone at the hotel was very nice  I used the fitness center a couple times  It has  treadmills  bikes and  elypticals  I think there were some free weights and a couple weight machines  The indoor pool was cute but must be accessed through the fitness center bathrooms so there was a pretty steady stream of loud kids and people exploring  I LOVED the Loggia off of the fitness center The weather was beautiful and they had a few loungers out there so you could relax and nap in the refreshing breeze  One of our best meals was a block away at Rosebuds on Rush  It was great Italian food Huge portions a great wait staff and a nice ambiance  The  elevators are not a problem  It never took more than a few seconds for an elevator to come  Check in Hotel Desk is on the rd floor  The restaurant is on   We had breakfast here each day and it was great The breakfast buffet is the best value  If they dont have it set up tell them you want to order the buffet to the table and they will bring you all of the selections you want that is offered on their buffet You dont have to get up they just keep bringing what you ask for PLUS we always sat by the window with a great view of Michigan Ave  Great quotpeople watchingquot location The rooms have a nice wet bar with a coffee maker  We ordered up a mini refrigerator for day  Not bad if you needwant to store some food  There is a great Grocery Store Trader Vics about  blocks away from the hotel  Lots of gourmet and organic selections  Be sure to get online and join the Omnis club You will get free wireless internet everyday  complimentary beverages delivered each morning with the newspaper of your choice plus several other perksI dont know about a business center but I saw a computer on the th floor that looked like a public access computer but there was never anyone on itThis hotel was a great value For this location on Michigan ave  I only paid nt and it included  in food vouchers 
P => Lovely Hotel We arrived at the Omni on nd tember for a  day stay  I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated  I couldnt go out for  days The room was spacious and clean  The bed was extremely comfortable  The bathroom was large and very clean  What more could you ask We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested I managed to go to the th floor to see the sun terrace outside the gym Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim  A few sunbeds on a concrete floor  There was also noise from an air conditioning unit  It could do with a bit of cheering up What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing it has something for everyone Would I go back to the Omni yes I would  
P => Great Location At the last minute a friend and I ided to go to Chicago for the Labor Day weekend  We chose the Omni for our  day stay since the hotel had a good online rate  The Omni is comfortable and clean but the layout of the facility is a bit awkward  we never did find the th floor pool  The bathroom is nice and there is alot of storage in the bedroom but the bedroom itself is a bit tight for two double beds  Being a preferred guest I was offered free morning beverages and the option to have two items of clothing pressed  I used both benefits but was charged for the pressing  The representative who checked us in did not have a clue  She completely botched our room payment she charged my credit card for the full stay as well as my companions  She also charges an additional  for incidentals  The morning of check out customer service rep Megan informed me that her colleague made a mistake on our room payment and she promptly corrected both the double payment and laundry charge  For the price Omni was sufficient and the location would be hard to beat but if we return to Chicago I think well try the suites at Trump Tower  
P => Just cant fault the place Having stayed at many hotels downtown the Omni has to be the best location comfort and a great welcome  The suite was perfect for us on an extended Labor Day weekend the knowledge of the Concierge was tried and tested over and over  Being a select guest Coffee was delivered each morning without fail he NEEDS his coffee  Everything we needed was right on our doorstep and it was like returning home each day  We could go on and on  All I can personally say is Stay at the Omni    you WONT regret it  
P => Awesome   I definitely recommend We just returned from a  day stay at the Omni and our expectations were definitely exceeded  When we arrived the doorman immediately took our luggagecarseatsbaby gear which is substantial when you are on a  week trip with an  month old and a  year old  When we walked up to the front desk the woman immediately greeted us by name She gave each of our kids their own little backpack filled with toys and goodies for their trip  They were just thrilled We ordered room service that night and it was delicious    we had the sausage pizza for only  and it was huge and delicious    enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch the following day  Room service called an hour and a half later to make sure that the food was to our liking and that our dishes had been picked up WOW  The next morning my husband took the kids to speak with Melissa the concierge on duty that morning   she was AMAZING She not only was a wealth of information but incredibly friendly  She also picked up that we were celebrating our anniversary and when we returned from the Cubs game that day a piece of flourless chocolate cake four chocolate covered strawberries and Evian water was waiting for us with a handwritten card from us  We were stunned The hotel itself is on the best part of Michigan Avenue and is truly steps to everything including the subway and bus service which is clean and easy The rest of our stay was great  There were always employees around in case we needed any information and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful  We could not be happier  There is a construction site right next to the hotel but it wasnt noisy and our kids love to watch the excavator work every day  I had called ahead of our arrival to have the room baby proofed and housekeeping told me it would be taken care of us  Unfortunately it wasnt but it didnt out to be an issue for us  The only other possible concerns I might convey about the hotel is the lack of a small fridge we used the mini bar and microwave and the proximity to the Northwestern campus hospital we heard a lot of ambulances at night  Again these didnt really turn out to be issues for us and youre going to get noise anywhere you stay on the Magnificent Mile Overall we loved our stay and will definitely come back to the Omni  The rooms were exceptionally clean and well cared for during our stay  The staff could have been any better and the location was perfect  Thanks for a great vacation in beautiful and fun Chicago 
P => Great hotel  dont miss this one if you are in Chicago  My family and I just returned from a short stay at the Omni Chicago  The staff at this hotel goes above and beyond to make sure you have an enjoyable experience  Every staff person we met was helpful and had a smile on their face  I was traveling with two small children under the age of two which can be difficult at times  The hotel staff did all the little things that make traveling easier  i e  holding the elevator as you try and load two strollers  Upon arrival my children received small backpacks with toys as a small gift which was great for my  year old  Each time we made a special request like extra pillows or a crib you received a follow up call about  minutes later making sure you received everything  Something you dont find at most hotels The hotel is in a fabulous location on Michigan Ave  We stayed in the Governors Suite which was a real treat  It was one of the largest suites we have ever been in and is well worth the splurge  It makes suites at the Ritz Carlton look tiny  Overall the hotel is great in every way  I have stayed at several of the luxury hotels in Chicago Ritz Four Seasons and Fairmont and this hotel has service that is above these hotels or at least you get a genuine smile from all of the staff unlike the forced niceness you find at other luxury hotels Save yourself some money or splurge on a larger suite at the Omni Chicago  You wont be disappointed  We will make this our new hotel in Chicago for family trips  
P => Great location great hotel We just got back from a weeklong familiy vacation  family of  with  kids ages  amp   and really enjoyed our stay at the Omni  The room was a good size for our family although we didnt spend much time in it aside from sleeping  The kids liked the pool and were happy to splash around each morning before heading out for the day  We all loved the free beverages that came with the Select Guest program  the kids especially liked to change it up getting hot chocolate one morning and cranberry juice the next  The breakfast buffet at  was pretty good but the regular menu was better  We had a delicious room service breakfast one morning Kids got a special quotkid packquot when we checked in complete with milk and cookies which was a really sweet touch  Location was great  right on the Mag Mile and about one block from the bus stop that goes right to Museum Campus Shedd Adler Field and the Museum of Science and Industry  About a  minute walk to the nearest Red Line subway which was very easy  Walking distance to Water Tower John Hancock which we could see from our window Navy Pier Oak Street beach and loads of places to eat and shop  Definitely recommend it 
P => Perfect location great hotel Only stayed one night but wished we could have stayed longer  Room was clean and spacious bed was very comfortable bathroom was large with a nice big vanity and walk in shower  The amenities were perfect even a lighted makeup mirror  All the staff members were very friendly and helpful but especially k the bellman who showed us to our room and filled us in on all the hotel details  Location was right on Mag Mile and convenient to everything  I will stay there again 
P => I was impressed I travel all over the U S  as part of my job for conferences workshops and training  My agency booked our conference here and I in turn made reservations to stay here for the duration of the workshop which was  days I really enjoyed my stay  I thought the staff was friendly and accommodating  The housekeeping staff kept my room clean and I loved the turn down service  I did not indulge in the   water bottle or the   Snickers bar in the wet bar area however the suite was clean large and comfortable  The bed and pillow were so comfortable and I slept really well  I felt very pampered while there  I enrolled in the Select customer program and enjoyed the juice coffee newspaper and free internet service in my room  I did not eat a meal in  however did meet with co workers in the lounge for a few drinks at the end of the work day and the bartenders were knowledgeable and friendly  I take note of bar service as I also bartend part time at a resort hotelconference center in my city  Even though this hotel is more than I could afford to come to on my own I am considering staying here again if I come to visit Chicago anytime in the future  I loved the accomodations and I loved the time I spent on the Magnificent Mile The fitness center was a welcome amenity NOTE even if you smoke dont ask for a smoking room  Smoke outside  It is difficult to remove that odor from the room even though I left the windows open all day Thanks Omni staff  
P => Classic and Comfortable Having stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel three times in the past seven years for our annual shoppingsightseeing trips we have found this hotel to be the most convenient and comfortable hotel  The staff is friendly and helpful  Bellpersons are very welcoming and we never had to carry a single back to or from our rooms  My teenage dhters loved the arate living room and all the drawer and closet space  While the bathrooms are a bit cramped everything was was always in working order and clean  The housekeeping staff were always there with clean towels and our room was always picked up and clean  The laundry service had our clothes cleaned and pressed by the next day  Rooms are very spacious  Great hotel great people 
P => Hope to visit Chicago again and will look forward to staying at the Omni Our recent  day stay was very pleasant and our overall experience at the Omni was very good  The suite style room gave us a sense of space and it was very comfortable  Joining their guest programme provided a daily paper with coffee and juice every day which was much appreciated  The hotels location was perfect for us as we walked to most attractions and could take the  bus up and down Michigan Avenue to many other locations The staff were always pleasant and in a couple of cases were more than that showing an enthusiasm for their work which is not always obvious with many in the hospitality industry  In particular one young woman working in the  Restaurant was a delight sharing information about the dishes she served with an obvious passion for food and her work  as noted in other reviews is on the pricey side but it is downtown Chicago after all and the quality of the food makes it actually a good value  We had one dinner and two breakfasts one a la carte and one Sunday brunch and they were both excellent  We also used the bar on several occasions as it was comfortable and convenient  When you are tired and just want a comfortable spot to relax in without leaving your hotel the  lounge is perfect  Go for the comfy chairs overlooking Michigan avenue enjoy your drink and take in the scene down below  Good service here too  We loved Chicago thought the Omni was just what we were looking for in terms of quality comfort location and value and will stay there again  
P => great location good service I spent  nights at the Omni while attending a conference and having stayed in most of the hotels in Chicago at one time or another I was impressed  The locations great the rooms were comfortable and the service good There was one problem I had  The plug wouldnt come out of the bathtub whatever I did I assumed it was one of those part fixed ones and I couldnt make it stay open so I propped it open with a tube of something to let the shower water drain  On my return that evening I found the plug on the side of the bath but when I looked to see what it had been catching on I discovered a wad of hair down the drain and covering the bottom of the plug hole   It was the size of a large mouse and had clearly been building up for weeks given a  the smell and b  the presence of multiple colourstypes of hair  Totally and utterly disgusting and I was amazed that the cleaner had bothered to disentangle the plug itself from it and then just left it there To give the management their due they did send someone up when I phoned and I got  of vouchers for fooddrink as compensation which my company was very grateful for as it reduced my bill but it did mean that Im having to knock a star off of this review  
P => The Omni lives up to its mission statement Having read the reviews before traveling to Chicago we were not disappointed  The Omni lives by their mission statement which is to quotexceed your expectationsquot The manager and the rest of the Omni staff are superb at making sure your needs are met  I was greeted by the manager while in line checking in and it just got better from there  An excellent hotel with very well trained staff whose priy role is to make sure you have an excellent stay The extra space in the suite was great and as advised by previous reviews I joined the Omni Select Guest program  As a result we had free wireless and complimentary refreshments hot and cold  with your selection of newspapers each day Cleaning staff leave the room spotless and concierge services are second to none We also used the business center to print boarding passes before checking out The location is excellent with several good restaurants nearby There is a quotCorner Bakeryquot one block east and one block south which is very reasonable for breakfast or lunch  All in all a fantastic stay at the OMNI and I have to say that Chicago is a wonderful city to visit  
P => Friendly Service Comfortable Room Great Location The staff were friendly and helpful in every area and made it a pleasure to stay there  The room was very spacious and comfortable with all of the ammenities we needed  Great location on the quotMagnificent Milequot where we were able to walk to many points of interest attractions and some incredible restaurants  One suggestion the first night we left the windows open and it was noisy you are on a busy street and near a hospital  Closed the windows and used the air conditioning and we didnt hear a thing  
P => An Excellent Property in a Great Location The Omni Chicago really delivers on all fronts from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on Michigan Avenue  While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality the Omni delivers  Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under  minutes the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events and the rooms are some of the largest youll find at this price range in Chicago  Even the quotstandardquot room has a arate living area and work desk  The fitness center has free weights weight machines and two rows of cardio equipment  I shared the room with  others and did not feel cramped in any way All in all a great property 
P => Pleasant stay    our  month old boy loved it We stayed at Omni Chicago for  nights in early y y    The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo  We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for foodampbeverages  I also signed up for their loyalty program which was so worth it I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second class guest because of the price we paid  But I was totally wrong They treated us extremely well  Before our arrival I got an email asking if we needed anything  So I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk  And they arranged it for us without charge  We arrived late on Thursday night  Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested  We were given a corner suite on the th floor   very nice room   comfy bed  My husband was really wowwwww The bed was made ready for us   both in the bedroom and the sofa bed we didnt use the sofa bed though  We got a high speed Internet as part of the loyalty program  All staff were friendly and helpful   front desk valet parking bell boy room service concierge    everyoneWe used the voucher for room service breakfasts both morning  The first day was great  Food was great and quick  We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program  We ordered OJ and hot chocolate  They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning  But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible  It tasted like left over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate  Also we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries   but we got a plain waffle  So we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those  This is why I didnt give quotquot for service  However I reported these issues to the front desk when checking out and the front desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal Another thing is that its quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor  We could hear siren going on amp off during the night  But this is out of the hotels control though  And I would say that it didnt bother us at all  My baby could sleep very well Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago  
P => Will never bother trying another hotel in Chicago I have stayed at the Omni Chicago three times now  Twice with children and once with just my husband  I LOVE it  Always spotless always beautiful  I have never encountered such helpful people anywhere else  Its like they really WANT to help you We dont get that around Springfield IL very often I always come back to this hotel for one main reason   room size  Especially with kids  I love that we can be in one room and they can be in another and you are not so crowded  There is even room for all your luggage  You can spread out  I dont know who is running this hotel but they know what they are doing  I recommend to every single person I talk to that is planning their Chicago weekend  Thanks so much for  great trips Cant wait to come back  One tiny thing    please please bring back that free Starbucks coffee that used to flow in the lobby  I really missed it last time  
P => Customer Service even a  year old says is lousy Reserved this hotel thru Travelocity and specifically for  adults and  children  Received the confirmation for  persons in the room but room type wasnt specified so called the hotel directly the next morning to make sure that we were in a room w pull out sleeper sofa for the kids  Was told that would not be a problem  Arrived at hotel and front desk told us they were full and we would have a room w  chairs in it and no sofa sleeper  Reminded the staff that I had called to verify the room type and had two children who needed a place to sleep but was repeatedly told quotwe are fullquot  I ultimately insisted on the children having a place to sleep so they said we could have  rollaway beds  The living room was so small these didnt really fit and we had to choreograph the room quite creatively to get them in  For a  night stay this was tough I read in their hotel manual in the room that only one rollaway bed is allowed in the room so this was technically against their own fire regulationsAlso I kept checking on changing room to one w sleeper sofa as I had been promised and based on reservation w  persons  Each of  staff members at front desk always said quotIm sorry we are fullquot with no other assistance  Housekeeping was forgotten on one day and after calling and was told they would be quotright upquot hadnt arrived an hour later so went down to front desk to complain  They sent up housekeeping after another half hour Of note is that even though hotel says that the construction next door is mostly complete the demolition it was still VERY loud on our side of the hotel as workers arrived with jackhammers early in the mornings on week days Also no night time turn down service two nights as was described Valet service was friendly but expensive at night Swimming pool is small and hot tub is only for  people  Very small area around pool for families to sit only large enough for be   familiesLocation is great but there are plenty of other hotels in the immediate area with much better service  
P => Service makes this hotel worth every penny I have to say that this hotel exceeded our expectations The hotel itself is very nice  Yes you have to take two elevators to get from the outside to your room but we stayed here  days and never waited more than a minute Check in was a breeze  While we waited Steve was in line with us giving us all the info we wanted on different sites wed like to visit  Kids were greeted with a kiddie bag upon arrivalLocation is superb Right in the heart of it all  Great casual dining restaurant at Grand Lux two blocks away  We did eat at  in the hotel one night and wound up spending  for a kids meal  burgers with fries and  sodas  Food was good but not that good  The bellmen are fantastic  Very friendly and helpful with directionsRoom was spacious enough for all of us  Was very nice we had doors that shut to our room so they could pull the bed out of the couch and watch tv in the living area while we watched tv in our bedroom  Wish there was a microwave but again not something I would base my ision on in the future Pool was perfect size  Not too small but not big  The hottub was great when it was working  The first night we got to enjoy it  The second night the water was freezing  The third night it was only  filled so I called the front desk and someone came and filled it Fitness room was REALLY nice  I like that they provide headphones to watch tv on the treadmills  The ice cold water with fresh lemons is a bonus tooThe hotel was great and we will only stay here in the future  The reason we will be back is because of the service  Everyone that works there is ALWAYS smiling  We were greeted our first night with chocolates and Evian water be because we are a loyalty member  We also received complimentary beverages every morning as a loyalty member and that was a GREAT thing My kids LOVED waking to drinks at our door  The entire staff treats you as though you are royalty which Ive ever really experienced in Mexico and that is because they are all looking for tips  Here at the Omni it is just expected out of their employees THANK YOU OMNI We loved your service and hotel 
P => Omni Chicago  Would Stay There Again  I would like to start out by saying that I would stay again at the Omni Chicago Hotel  The only small things I think a guess should be aware of at this hotel is the following In order to get to your room you must always take two elevators there is no gift shop or place to pick up coffee etc in the hotel and there is no real lobby  just a small sitting area on the third floor  I do believe you can get starbucks at a stand for a few hours each morning but that is it  Also parking is   per day The good however out way the small negatives the hotel is spotless the staff is always helpful the rooms are large clean and not run down  Your location is wonderful right off Michigan Ave  The pool and heath club are very nice  It is a great hotel for both business and pleasure  The hotel is all two bedrooms suites with plenty of room  
P => Nice hotel   not so nice bed Stayed for three nights at the Chicago Omni  Overall it was a nice hotel  The location was great right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and the staff was very nice  The hotel had a nice workout facility a lap pool and small hot tub  people max  Everything was kept clean  The room had two TVs one a flat screen  There wasnt a door between the bedroom and sitting area so when you would change the channel on one TV the other would sometimes change too  You had to be careful where you aimed the remote  The room had a large walk in shower with multiple jets  There was no bathtub  There wasnt much room in the closet at all  The rod was very low and the safe took up most of the area  There were plenty of drawers though  The worst part of the hotel unfortunately is one of the most important things  The bed was just so uncomfortable  It was only a double in size but that I could live with  The mattress was so hard and just not comfortable at all  This would be the only thing that might prevent me from staying at the Omni again  
P => superb employees at every turn first i would like to state that we were at this hotel for two nights celebrating our th anniversary  check in was a breeze and after mentioning our anniversary we found a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake delivered to our room with quothappy anniversaryquot written in chocolate syrup on the plate   a wonderful surprise every time we returned to the hotel   valets bellmen and desk personal on ground level said quotwelcome backquot lots of smiles throughout the hotel  our corner room was small but very clean and linens were top notch as well as tolietries  we had a wonderful view of south michigan avenue  the rooms need to be redone as are experiencing a somewhat slightly worn look  loved the ameneties at the coffee bar and mini fridge in our room  the reception desk ran off directions for church macys shall fields quotwalnut roomquot for lunch and directions to quottaste of chicagoquot in grant park  the location of the hotel is great for walking anywhere valet parking somewhat higher than normal  
P => Outstanding stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel My wife and I travelled to Chicago and really were treated like royalty by the hotel staff My brother and his wife also stayed during this period  The front desk staff the concierge the Star Bucks server the restaurant the lounge servers       all were wonderful The rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great The bath room was a real plus     it was huge and had everything one desires  Great view from th floor to Michigan Avenue below Overall great stay and highly recommended 
P => Location location location This hotel is located in the absolutely best place possible if you are in Chicago on a leisure trip  Its walking distance to most downtown attractions and even if its raining it clears up long enough to dash for a short taxi ride back to the hotel  Staff were very serviced oriented greeted us on site and seemed genuinely concerned that all aspects of our stay were excellent  Bell staff and concierge and everyone we encountered walking around the hotel engaged us in conversation and opened doors called elevators asked how we were doing  We were staying at a discounted rate but the vast majority of the staff treated us like we were Branjolina   Front desk people stood out as slightly cool but still professional just not quite up to the standard of the rest of the employees  The restaurant  was nice good view good food and they have organic choices and nice options for vegetarians and folks who are careful about fat and added ingredients  Not at all over priced considering it was a hotel restaurant  Room is great even the quotcheap seatsquot smallest suite is fabulous and they make amazing use of the space  Nice or nothing spectacular but well done  Furniture was a bit worn and chair arms needed cleaning but still nicely appointed  Carpet was clean so you can walk barefoot without fear and linens were crisp and new looking  A few small maintenance needs   one handle was broken and the base of the dresser and baseboards are a little scraped up from the vacuum cleaner mini bar was not cold enough to entice me to pop open an  orange juice toilet ran a lot but overall the room was really well cared for  A little mildew staining around shower handle but it looked like old stains that just need a bit of bleach  It is not worth the regular price but the Hotwire and Priceline deals for   are about what it is worth for the location and the service considering the economy and the other great deals that are out there  In better times this was certainly worth the  or so standard rate but now they really need to either refresh the room or or keep those prices competitive  The turndown service certainly makes up for any small wear issues on the furniture It is wonderful to come back in the evening to the relaxing music and low lights Construction outside is also a detraction jackhammering etc but they cant do anything about that  This is my fifth Omni and its not as nice as the one in San Francisco OMG that is a gorgeous place or Tucson but from the reviews it looks like this Omni is good for a downtown Chicago hotel and I agree that it was a great place and I will definitely consider it for a future visit  
P => Two Thumbs Up Omni Our first time at an Omni Hotel was a most enjoyable one  For starters on the days leading up to the reserved dates of our stay we received a number of emails from Omni which informed us of events happening in Chicago predicted weather as well as restaurants nearby Our arrival and check in at the hotel located just a few blocks south of the Hancock Tower on N  Michigan Ave  was a smooth and quick process  Our room a suite on the nd Floor was fairly well appointed  We had our two kids with us so the two double beds and the pull out were put to good use  An armchair could have filled an empty corner in the Living Area and would have been useful to watch the large flat screen or even to rest your feet  The sofa bed sufficed  The beds were very comfortable firm enough but still comfy there was an extra large safe two TVs a bar with sink a large bathroom with two doors and even opening windows  Everything worked well and was very clean We had signed up as  Select Guests  which entitled us to morning juice or coffee brought to the room at least  newspapers and free wireless internet which would have cost  day otherwise  We also used the  Entertainment Rate  which brought it down to about USnight  Given the location service and hotel class it was great  We only used the gym facility that had about a dozen machines and an outdoor k on the th Floor  It was clean well maintained and didn t fee claustrophobic I would stay there again given the chance As for our time spent in the Windy City all of  days we did a lot including Bobby s Bike Hike NorthsideGold Coast with Erin the Architecture Foundation River Tour a picnic lunch in Millennium Park deep dish pizza at Giordano s a drink at the top of the Hancock at PM no lines and great light and it beats paying for the observatory  floors below as you only pay for the drink Magnificent Mile shopping and a wrap up dinner at Boka in Lincoln Park  If you are new to Chicago I would highly recommend all of the above  We hit it just right with the weather so that helps a lot  For the deep dish pizza no matter where you go for at dinner time on the weekend Uno Due Gino s East or Giordano s you re looking at a  hour wait so go later like PM  Boka is a fairly new cutting edge restaurant be a couple years old or so  Chef is a Charlie Trotter prot g  C T  is one of the handful of premier way up scale restaurants in Chi town with prices to match and the menu at Boka is unlike most others  You will not be disappointed with he compilation of tastes and flavors the kitchen will put together each dish is like a fine wine complex and long  No Tiramisu Cr me Caramel chocolate mouse cake or fresh fruit cheesecake on this dessert menuNeedless to say we had a great time 
P => Mixed Review   Great Location too much construction when I was there A great hotel in a great location steps to the shopping district  If you re going further afield the regular bus service stops can be found within a block  The lobby and reception area of the Omni were modern and tastefully appointed a theme which was followed through to the bar and restaurant areas  The hotel room itself was spacious clean and fairly well appointed with nice or a modern flat screen LCD TV and cordless phone  The only negative point was the construction going on right next door  They are completely re doing the area next to the hotel  So dont think about sleeping in  Apart from that the service given by the rest of the Omni s staff was first class  Highly recommended  
P => Excellent hotel and location Guests are treated well Very nice hotel located directly on Michigan near great upscale shopping and restaurants  Sirens on Michigan were very noisy all night as was construction next door all day  Service was spectacular and everything was very clean  Turn down every night  Cookies were left for my dhter along with a bottle of Evian and a personal note  They had a gift bag for my dhter when we arrived  Concierge was very helpful  Everyone greeted us whenever we came and went  Coffee at the restaurant was excellent  Prices affect the rating for any establishment however  Parking at  is too much  Most downtown parking is  or under  Some garages are   For  a night it should come back cleaned and waxed with fresh cups of coffee inside  We got an excellent deal on travelzoo com  however our experience sold us on this hotel and we will make an effort to check this hotel first on our next visit Prices fluctuate but when it nears  this hotel is too expensive  Over  is too expensive    is reasonably fair but I always try to come in below  pretax  Great hotel that gets extra hype from Oprah  With the many great hotels downtown prices must stay competitive  
P => Perfect Location Great Service Very nice hotel in a perfect location corner of Michigan Ave and Huron  The rooms are spotless and have a arate sitting area  Room service for breakfast was quick  Our only glitch was the  minute delay in getting our room they offered us a different room on the th floor but there was too much chlorine smell from the pool  We went up a floor to the lounge to wait and Jennifer A  of the concierge staff tracked us down and gave us some food vouchers for our trouble  This is the type of quality service that I have always experienced at Omnis  
P => Nice hotel in a great location We stayed at the Omni for four nights in   The location was ideal for all the sights and the staff were polite and very helpful  The Fitness Room whilst not over equipped was more than adequate for the amount of people in there  The suite was spacious enough with plenty of wardrobe space  However the only negative was that the rooms were a bit dark and in need of oration and although it was classed as non smoking there was an odour of smoke in the room  No doubt reoration and new carpets would resolve this  On the whole we would recommend this as a good place to stay  
P => Great Hotel    I was a guest at the hotel this is not an employee   This hotel was very nice The location was right downtown  The staff was great and very friendly  We needed a pair of shoes from our car and they brought them to our room within min  The restaurant and bar were nice with good food  A little pricey but worth the money bc of the convenience  The gym was clean with new equipment a pool and hot tub Our room had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan  Our room was squeaky clean with a large desk a sofa bed two tvs and very comfortable beds This was the first hotel in Chicago that I actually walked around my room without shoes on The bathroom was the best part bc it was so big  We had four girls getting ready in there with room to spare We called for more coffee and they brought it up to us and called to make sure we got it  We even lost an earring and housekeeping found it outside our door and gave it to us the next morning  Ive been to about  different hotels in Chicago and Ive found the best one I will always stay at the Omni 
P => Outstanding hotel in a great part of Chicago We have just returned from a family trip to Chicago and chose the Omni because of location and because they did a corner suite to house two adults and two children  The level of service cleanliness and helpfulness at the hotel cannot be over rated  In particular both concierges were incredibly helpful for booking trips and recommending places to eat  We loved the hotel but found our room slightly too small for our family   it was only a week though and it would not stop us booking again  The drinks and food are not cheap but I think relatively good value for the location and class of hotel  It was fab 
P => Blown away by their exceptional service Just got back from a  night stay at the Omni Michigan Avenue and it was without a doubt one of the most rekable hotel stays weve had in years  During  days of our comings and goings at all and sundry hours not a single staff member missed a beat    we were always greeted with a Hello and a Smile by everyone from the doorman to the desk to personnel in the hallways  Doors were opened for us elevators held and even buttons pushed when our hands were full  Room service appeared when we asked it to and was absolutely delicious and on a trolley that folds out to a full round table so you arent stuck eating at the desk or the sofa  And when I called to have the trolley removed they asked how Id enjoyed my food   using my name and referring to the actual dishes Id ordered  Not a single member of the staff was ever too pre occupied with hisher own work and never chatter to engage us as soon as we appeared and consistently went the extra mile even for the most simple requests The room itself was very nice impeccably clean and very large and the hotel has one of the best spots on the Mag Mile  But its the service that stands out in my mind above all  Im from Chicago and return a number of times each year and have stayed at the Peninsula Four Seasons Ritz many of the Hyatts and Hiltons  I tried out the Omni because of the reviews on there and simply cant imagine staying anywhere else next time Im in Chicago  Congratulations to this team and the GM on impressing the value of these quotlittle thingsquot that make a stay smooth and so memorable  
P => Fantastic hotel in the heart of Chicago    We just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni  I read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on  The location staff rooms amenities etc were all wonderful  Huge thank you to TA members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program  We did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks  I loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper  We were in room  which was perfect  Corner suite with two out of the  sides of the rooms being windows with a great view  The room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV  The bathroom amenities were wonderful  I loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided  The turn down service was great as well  We would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us  We ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious  The blueberry muffins were the best I have ever had  Everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly  The staff at the Omni is so accomodating  Everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is  Have to thank the concierge Melissa and Curtis  They were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do  I also used the gym during my stay and it was great  All the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd TV attached  And the gym itself had two plasmas  They also had cold lemon water for you after your workout  I am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning  It really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else  I also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there  Everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed  Thank you Trip Advisor for another great trip suggestion 
P => Home away from home  We really enjoyed out stay at the Omni and thought the hotel to offer excellent value and wonderful large spacious suites which we appreciated especially since we had heaps of luggage  The Omni is a very comfortable hotel located in a prime position offering a   home away from home   experience Location   Absolutely fabulous position just located on the corner of Magnicent Mile and basically opposite the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Peninsular Hotel  Check in   Fast welcoming and efficient but that later came with a problem when entering our room  We noticed some left over food on the kitchen bench and the bed turned down  We immediately rang reception and explained the condition of the room  Staff were extremely helpful and immediately had us in another room within  mins and were sincerely apologetic for any problems  Plus they kindly gave us two free vouchers for breakfast   well done   Room   Our  new  suite  consisted of a small lounge room with couch coffee table working desk and a compact kitchenette with tea and coffee facilities  The bedroom was a arate room with a exceptionally comfortable king size bed with lovely city views  Off the bedroom was a very spacious bathroom with a shower over the bath and two vanity units  We enjoyed having ample space for our luggage and ourselves and found the suite to be very cosy Breakfast   was served in the main restaurant bar area with an excellent variety of continental and hot food  Staff members were also very attentive friendly and polite Staff   We would like to thank our maid housekeeper who made our stay more pleasurable by the attentive personal service  
P => What a nice stay at the Omni I just got back from staying at the Omni with my family for the weekend  It was so nice and right in the middle of the shopping and resturants  The Disney Store was really close and my dhter loved it One thing I noticed that was everyone from the guy who parked your car to the waitresses to the housekeepers is everyone was smiling  The hotel seemed very clean and the food in the barresturant area was great  My wife loves cheese and they had a large selection to choose from it was served in a very nice presentation  I had the Ribeye as my entree and it was really good I use trip advisor when going out of town and find this information valuable  I am sure you will enjoy the Omni   
P => Best location best staff and best suite weve enjoyed in over  years of business and pleasure travel  My wife and I travel to Chicago every year and having tried several other downtown hotels the Omni is nd to none and we dont even think about staying anywhere else  The suites are great and very spacious  The staff is excellent and the location superb  I also travel to Chicago every fall for a football game with a group of guys and everyone raves about the hotel  The gym is also great  
P => THE place to stay in Chicago The location is perfect the rooms are great and the service is excellent  Each time I go there on business or for a weekend getaway I am treated like a VIP from the entire staff  The last time I stayed here I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant   the food and service was EXCELLENT  I recommend the mini Kobe burgers the Ribeye and the Bouillabase  My wife and I are planning another weekend getaway in e and cant wait to come back here 
P => Excellent Location First Class Service We stayed for five days over Memorial Day Weekend and had a great stay  The hotel is located approximately six blocks north of the river and right on Michigan Avenue which makes it metro and bus accessible  The front desk was top notch  Christy took excellent care of us at check in  Be sure to sign up for their special loyalty program it gives you a complimentary beverage and newspaper in the morning  We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again  
P => A Cant Miss Homerun I travel to Chicago frequently for both business and personal  I always stay at the Omni  Their location is perfect thier suites are terrific and their staff makes me feel like a VIP  The Omni is a cant miss homerun 
P => Fantastic suite great location great amenities and perks     Myself and my boyfriend visited Chicago for the first time this uary  The Omni doormen were extremely polite and welcoming  We had requested a high level room and were put on one of the top floors  The gym was excellent as was the pool perfect for a quiet morning swim  The room took our breath away we had a view of the Hancock and could see Lake Michigan in the distance  The suite consisted of a good sized lounge style room with chairs footrest flat screen TV desk and mini bar  The bathroom was a great size and could be accessed from the bedroom and lounge  The bed was enormous and comfortable and we received a complimentary turndown service with chocolates on our pillows each night and two complimentary drinks each of our choice delivered to our room at a time of our specification each morning  We had complimentary robes and nice toilettries  The bar and bar staff were great  The only minor negative point was the mini bar was rather expensive but that really didnt matter  Being an all suite hotel it felt like having a home away from home to get back to after a long days shopping and sight seeing  Overall this is the best Hotel we have ever stayed at  
P => Amazing Staff Better location Arrived for NRA food show on  and stayed four nights  Steve at front desk was super helpful and very polite  Bell staff and rest of crew as nice as Steve and nearly the best Ive ever encountered  Had a  bed suite with business partner  Room was not very big but the beds were super comfortable  We were out all day and night so in this city the size of the room never became an issue  We signed up for the guest program and received free wi fi daily as well as coffee juice and paper each morning  Only one day our coffee didnt arrive and we had to call   immediately delivered  The restaurant  has excellent breakfast buffet  but in this city pretty standard  The bar is a nice holding spot on the way out of town  Genos East deep dish was super  min to bake  Gene and Georgiettis also well worth it  We found The Chop House pricey and not as pleasing as GampG  The location is great if you like to shop  Amazing stores within a few blocks  The city was suprisingly VERY clean and beautiful  Back to the hotel  The turn down service was a plus the housekeeping staff was efficient  The only downside was the size of the rooms  The elevator system takes getting used to switch at floor  but was comforting for safety  Would recommend the hotel would stay again love chicago  Try BOKA Blackbirds the Perennial Avec for tapas like amazing cuisine  CheersMike 
P => Great place to stay Excellent service Loved it located on Magnificent Mile would definately stay here again  Nice pool hot tub and k  
P => Perfect Ive just returned from five nights in Chicago  Having never been before I was relying on friends amp colleagues experiences on where to stay shop visit etc  Most of the recommendations were good but the one to stay at the Omni was fantastic Right from when we were arrived being greeted at the front desk by name six sense by the front desk staff perhaps to leaving reluctantly there is nothing I could fault about this hotel  The location is perfect especially if you like to shop the rooms are very large and comfortable but its the staff which excel at the hotel  They are all so genuinely nice not a hint of the forced smilesoffers of help I have received at other hotels  I cant recommend this hotel and Chicago enough  
P => Great Location even with construction We stayed at teh Omni Chicago Hotel on a recent visit to Chicago and we had a great time  I will say that there is construction going on just to the south of the hotel major work in fact  But we requested a north facing room from the front desk and they were pleasant and accommodating  They gave us a room well furnished with views of Michigan Avenue  We couldnt hear the construction until we walked out the front door and walked a quarter block to Michigan Avenue  There it got loud  But as long as you request a north facing room you should be fine  It is right smack dab in the center of Michigan Avenue close to Giordanos Niketown and the Disney Store  So much fun  Overall the stay was great  
P => construction site nearby   dont go until it is over  I have stayed in the Omni before and it used to be a very nice place  However now there is a construction site right next to the hotel what makes sleeping after  am impossible  I wouldnt come back until the end of   
P => great place great location when you head in for a one night stay I had stayed at this hotel a long time back and while the rooms seem in need of a bit of an update they are by far larger than most in the downtown magnificent mile for the price Staff is extremely friendly and attentive  hitting the elevator buttons when they see you coming toward the elevators etc       the only complaint I have and it is partially my fault is that at check in I wish the front desk had briefly gone over my paperwork with me  inside were my coupons for the free beverage of choice dropped off at my room in the morning and paper  i didnt realize it until the morning when looking over my things and wondering why there was nothing available     i wish she had mentioned to hang it on my door before am  otherwise  everything was just wonderful 
P => Perfect location and perfect hotel During our week stay at the Omni we continued to be pleasantly surprised at the service  We arrived at the hotel at  am and they immediately checked us into a room  Service from the front desk concierge restaurant were all excellent  We loved that the room had a suite as I tend to sleep later than my spouse  Hotel is right in middle of Magnificient Mile  This is the first time we have ever loved a place enough to review it  Very quiet rooms  
P => Wonderful service   wonderful stay Just returned from a  day stay at the Omni Chicago  I have travelled extensively and have stayed in many different hotels world wide  I cant say enough about the warm welcome friendly staff and excellent service that I and my friends received at the Omni  Deserving a special mention is the Head Concierge Amiri who took care of us and all our requests including a very challenging one with respect to Oprah tickets  He and his colleague cus were not only efficient and knowledgeable they were friendly and truly went the extra mile to see that we enjoyed our stay  What we most appreciated about this hotel is that the staff genuinely seem to enjoy their work   we never got the impression that they were being pleasant because they have to  Housekeeping was the best and fastest Ive experienced the staff at the entrance always welcomed us back and asked if we needed anything service in the bar was quick and courteous  Im a fussy traveller yet have absolutely nothing but good to say about the Omni   except be that an update of the room or would be a plus    but thats certainly minor and in no way affected our wonderful stay  Great location for shopping and dining  Would definitely return and recommend  
P => Easter at the Omni My husband and I stayed at the Chicago Omni during Easter weekend   We enjoyed it thoroughly and would return  There was some construction off of Michigan Avenue but a request for a quiet room fixed that situation  Service in this hotel was exemplary especially room service and housekeeping  Location was superb  right on Michigan Avenue an easy walk to the major sites  The concierge must be the busiest man in Chicago and he took care of everyone with grace and ease  Another nice Omni stay in a beautiful and welcoming city  No I dont work for Omni 
P => Nice Hotel   Great Staff Just back from  night stay at Omni and would thoroughly recommend it  Staff bent over backwards to assist in anything no matter how minute  Great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my yo dhter  If i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges taxes etc for room service bar and restaurant but where is cheap these days Would definitely recommend it especially for families  
P => A lot better than most chain hotels We booked our stay at the Omni in Chicago as a result of a tip on a review of another Chicago on Tripadvisor  The person writing the review was very accurate This is a chain hotel but feels much less like one than many others we have stayed in  There are no long corridors to trail down from the lifts  The Bellman arrives with the luggage in a few minutes rather than an hour  We also did not feel that the staff did not stand with their hands out waiting for the tip as in some US hotels and that tips were genuinely appreciated All rooms are suites in this hotel and we got a   discount on the room rate which made it great value The hotel is situated on Chicagos Magnificent Mile and is handy for the major shops and most of the museums are within  minutes walk  Given the number of parks and the clean air due to the proximity to Lake Michigan we found Chicago a great walking city despite its size We only made limited use of the Concierge services of the hotel but they were very helpful and accurate in the information that they gave Top tip is to sign up for the Omni Hotels Select Guest Programme before you go as this entitles you to free wifi for your whole stay and complementary tea coffee etc  every morning We would definitely stay there again  
P => Great stay Stayed here for a convention over St Paddys day   Great location great hotel great room and great service We booked via priceline Cutting expenses where possible for business travel and not once was this mentioned at the check in counter   REFRESHING So many times the clerk mentions   ahh you booked via pricelinehotwire etc   almost as if to say you are lucky to stay here for that rate   Not this time   the check in was GREAT highlighted what was available in the room surrounding areas etc  Very nice that you have free internet if you are a select member Sign up before you go online  Really liked the suite layout also 
P => A mediocre Omni I planned a romantic trip to Chicago with my fiance and stayed at the hotel for three nights  Between the two of us weve had at least twenty Omni stays and are in the top tier of their select guest program  The hotels restaurant was under reation and drilling could be heard as early as  a m  although we were on the top floor and the windows were closed  The location is great  right on Michigan Avenue about a block away from Tiffany The staff was very accommodating and allowed the late check out I requested  However my late check out was not communicated to housekeeping and two different executive housekeepers knocked on my door and asked when my check out was  Considering that the privacy sign was on the door and we were trying to get some sleep this was inconvenient at best  When I called down to the front desk to request that my credit card be charged up front for room and tax this was done correctly however once we got home I found that my card had been authorized for more than three times the amount of the room I understand that mistakes do happen but my card is now over its credit limit and cannot be used until the hold drops  The newspapers we received in the morning were random and never exactly as we requested  The complimentary beverages were spot on though  the room service team is great One bellman stood out in particular  I didnt catch his name but he very kindly chatted with us in English and directed other guests in Spanish within one elevator trip  Our room was cleaned very nicely every day  kudos to the housekeepers Overall the stay was fine but it does not compare to the other Omnis weve stayed at  
P => A really nice hotel We stayed for  days having booked through Expedia and managed to find a good deal  Overall I thought this was a thoroughly nice hotel with some of the nicest staff I have ever encountered throughout all my travels Everyone was delightful and eager to help  We particularly liked the staff in the reception area who were happy to help us with all our enquiries and bookings  Checking in and out was rapid and our room was spotless and well equipped with a lovely comfortable bed  I had signed up for the Select Guest system on booking but unfortunately it hadnt registered with the booking  I had therefore requested a high floor in a quiet room away from lifts  We were given a room on a low floor directly overlooking building works and next to the lift  The drilling started at am I requested a move and we were allocated another room on the same floor   the noise was better but still audible at the low level but I assume the hotel was busy  I would think that the noise would be a problem for most guests and it is such a shame  We had breakfast once in the dining room and it was very pleasant but incredibly expensive  Drinks in the bar were a similar mortgage but with a really nice view  The swimming pool was pleasant and clean if a little soulless  We didnt use the gym but it looked fine  There are restaurants very near  It was our first visit to Giordanos   if you are ices too only order a small stuffed crust pizza for two   I wanted more but nearly expired when I saw it We went to see a Bulls game which was amazing went on an Architectural boat tour booked at the hotel which we really enjoyed and had cocktails in the Signature Bar of the Hancock Tower   a wonderful experience and well worth the cost  Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would go again when the building work next door is complete but they are just laying foundations     The hotels huge strength is its staff   nothing was too much trouble and I was enormously touched and impressed with each of them   were not used to people caring in England so much  Thank you for having us  
P => if you have small children stay here the staff goes out of there way to make you amp your children feel welcome  they treat the children like high class guests   special backpacks on check in and cookies amp milk at night   also have games you can ask for at front desk   very clean and nice workoutpool you cant beat the location for american girl disney and lego stores    
P => Kid Friendly But Needs Better Service We live within driving distance of Chicago and take family trips in with a  year old on weekends occasionally  This is our third stay at the Omni which we love because its all suites meaning we can put the kiddo to bed and stay up watching movie and chatting with a bottle of wine  The location is superb beach Navy Pier good park affordable food amp a Trader Joes all nearby the beds are excellent the rooms are spacious and well designed and the restaurant breakfast buffet is fantastic The Omni also bills itself as kid friendly which it is by design  not only the suites but also a small pool amp whirlpool  But the service on our recent stay could have been much better  Kids usually get a welcome backpack but none were available when we arrived and when we called on the second day to ask for one we had to wait an hour and call twice to have one brought up anyone with a  year old will understand that waiting isnt easy  Milk amp cookies at turndown is another nice kid treat but once again it took two calls one after they forgot it at turndown and anxious waiting  They also advertise kid suitcases with activities that can be used at the hotel but in my three stays there has never been one available do they even exist  The last two times we stayed at the hotel there was a DVD player in the room so we came equipped with a couple of kid videos  This time the room didnt have a DVD player and I was told that it would cost  to have one brought to the room  You can rent movies on demand but  per movie is a bit steep  Im also a member of their frequent guest program and yet my room preferences were completely ignored too full perhaps  So while I still love this hotel for many reasons they need to step up their service  its not currently  star quality especially where their kid friendly amenities are concerned  
P => Nice staff average hotel I stayed at this hotel from ch  until ch th for business  The hotel was adequate  nothing special  The rooms even though they are suites are cut up with small bathrooms  The front desk staff were lovely and the concierge on Monday and Tuesday was most helpful  The man on the concierge desk on Sunday was not great  I felt I was putting him out by asking questions  The restaurant  was great for breakfast  I did order room service one morning   very small breakfast room service menu  and costly If you are looking for a basic hotel on the Magnificent Mile this is ok  I would much rather stay at the Intercontinental or the Ritz for a similar price  
P => Incredible location and service I stayed at the Omni Chicago in ch for business  The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and helpful  I had to arrive early and they accomodated me without any fuss The hotel is located on Michigan Avenue close to Northwestern and the major shopping centers  The hotel is clean and modern with soft comforting touches  My room was very big as was the bathroom also appreciated was the high placement of the showerhead  The views from the room were inspiring and the bed was one of the more comfortable ones that I have slept on I didnt use the gym or any of the restaurants  While there are literally a million hotel rooms in Chicago the Omni stands out because the quality of the room and the friendliness of the staff come at a price that is very affordable  The Omni offers free high speed internet connection if you join their promotional program another nice touch  
P => All Around Very Nice As others have written previously the Omni Chicago is a great hotel  We stayed about a week  I was tagging along on a business trip my boyfriend had  He checked in the night before I arrived  He left my name at the desk and I had no problem obtaining a key  The room is very comfortable and having the two rooms makes it nice when one person is a nightowl or gets up early to go to work  TVs in both rooms  DVD player in the living area and a Blockbuster is about a block away  Bed was super comfy with high quality linens  We had a corner room  and looked north and west  Not a great view but good light  We did have the mini bar key and used that refrig to store small things in  Theres a Trader Joes three blocks away The entire staff was pleasant efficient and professional  The concierge gave us some great ideas for dining and made reservations for us  The location is great just off Michigan Ave  across from the Apple Store  The red line train is  blocks away at State and Chicago  We got a good rate  during the week and  over the weekend nights  Good value for the quality  Sign up for their loyalty program and get free wifi and delivered coffee and juice in the morning  But skip their restaurant  Its nothing special and theres lots in the area  Also the business center charged   per  minutes to use the internet although you could print airline boarding passes for free  I just waited until BF got back with his laptop  Finally sign up for a Chicago Greeter  I had a great  hour walkabout and saw things and explored neighborhoods Id never been to before  
P => the two room suite was comfortable and well appointed and the staff could not have been more helpful  The Omni gets all the important things right great location good service comfortable rooms everything you need in the room or a phone call away  I requested a DVD player when I left in the morning and it was there and plugged in when I returned  Having the  room suite made for a very comfortable stay  I felt more like I was home in my den than in a hotel room  I will definitely stay there again  The only thing I missed was a steam room and sauna that I had in a prior Chicago hotel  But like I said the Omni gets all the important things right  
P => Omni rolls out the red carpet My husband and I stayed at the Omni for our honeymoon  We had found a pretty good rate on a standard suite and were very excited to arrive  When we did the front desk surprised us by upgrading us to the Presidential Suite for no extra charge  It was incredible the adence of the sofas the bathroom and the amenities within were top notch and the bed was so comfortable I was actually able to get rest Usually hotel beds are too soft or too hard   this one was perfect  The staff who brought us room service the consierge sp and the front desk staff seemed to truly be happy to take care of us and after spending a few days there we felt we had established a happy relationship with them  The restaurant had a velous brunch and the bar had a wide variety of excellent tinis I recommend the pink grapefruit  The pool was a great temperature and had an amazing sunk overlooking the Mag Mile  The convenience of the location was second to none and we cant say enough about it its a little pricey but you definitely get your moneys worth here  
P => Wonderful hotel in a great location My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for a Valentines day weekend getaway  We got a great rate on travelzoo that included unlimited valet parking and  per night foodbeverage vouchers for  per night  The food was excellent and the room service was speedy and courteous  The room was very nice and spacious  The hotel is conveniently located near shopping and restaurants  We joined the hotels free preferred program and got free internet access My boyfriend proposed here and we are considering having our wedding at this great site 
P => Excellent service amenities My wife and I stayed at the Omni this past wekend  We could not have been more pleased or impressed  The entire staff from doormen to desk personel to lounge and restaurant staff were friendly knowleadgeable and professional  The location is excellent  the room was immaculate  We highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again  
P => Very Nice Hotel Got a very good rate and package from travelzoo  Stayed  nights  Convenient to all the stores on Michigan Avanue  Nice suite room with King bedroom erate living room and large bathroom with doors to both rooms  Some noise from house keeping closet across from our room  Restaurant was very nice casual comfortable good food and selection with nice view over the Apple store  Didnt use the pool or exercise room but they looked nice  Valet parking only unless you park yourself at a neighboring garage  Staff was very courteous  
P => A Perfect Stay I stayed three nights at the Omni while I attended a workshop at nearby Northwestern University Law School  The hotel was chosen and booked directly by the law school administrators  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  Everyone went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful  The suites are comfortable and well appointed when I realized I was missing my packet of regular coffee in the morning Housekeeping had it at my door in less than two minutes  The fitness center business center and concierge service are all designed to make guests as comfortable as possible  The hotel is in a perfect location    an easy walk to either end of the Magnificent Mile and to Lake Michigan  There is no question that I will return to the Omni the next time I am in Chicago  Other hotels should take a lesson from their outstanding service and facilities  
P => excellent stay I booked my hotel stay on travelzoo and got a great rate  The hotel is all suites arate living room and bedroom located in the middle of michigan avenue shopping  The location is fantastic across the street from the Apple store  It is worth signing up for the loyalty program its free  You get free internet express check in and free morning drinks  The hotel staff was excellent  Room service was very good  The hotel gym has good equipment treadmills ellipticals weights and the pool is perfect especially if you have kids deepest was ftin  Overall one of the best stays in Chicago or anywhere else  
P => Wonderful hotel I have to say that this hotel was perfect in every wayIt has a fantastic location right on Michigan Ave with some lovely views our room looked straight down Mighigan Ave to Lake Michigan AmazingThe room was extremely large with erate living room and  tvsThe bed was sooo comfy and fresh and the chocs left on the pillow at the end of the day was a lovely touchWe asked for a room on a higher floor and got the very top floorThe staff are all very friendly and helpfulI recommend joining the free priority club as it gets you free newspaper and hot beverages and fruit juice in the morning at a time of your choice again nice touch There is some nice food places near by Portillos for lovely hotdogs and Gaurdinos excuse the spelling for wonderful pizza There is also a Tgi fridays just across the road I loved this hotel it lived up to all my expectations and more 
P => The best all around Chicago hotel Wonderful hotel with a great location  Rooms are as shown in photos  It was very clean exceptionally quiet and comfortable  Service was impeccable  Everyone on staff that we encountered from the doormen to the cleaning lady restaurant staff and front desk staff were genuinely polite and very professional  They do a great job at making you feel welcome  Further more having the check in area on the rd floor made it feel even cozier  Food and service at  on the th floor was terrific with a wonderful view of Michigan Avenue below  After staying at other hotels in Chicago I have to say   this is by the best You will not be disappointed  We already have reservations to stay there at the end of this month  Make a point to join their Select Guest program its worth it  Free beverages delivered to your room in the morning and a discounted rate on breakfast breads  
P => Wonderful Rooms Wonderful Service Ive stayed in Chicago several times over the past  years and the Omni Hotel was the best I have stayed in yet  Ive stayed in other pretty hotels in the area but what made the experience for me was their customer service  I stayed there for a weekend with my Mom for my st birthday and they brought up champagne chocolate covered strawberries and a big chunk of DELICIOUS chocolate cake  It was a treat especially since my Mom didnt ask for it nor was she required to pay for it  Ive found that if you ask for that kind of special attention the hotel will ask YOU to pay for it  Not so with the Omni On top of that our room had a bay window behind the bed with a beautiful view of the cityThe Omni is a perfect place to stay if you like elegant surroundings personal service and extra touches  It was really a pleasure to stay there 
P => Nice Downtown Hotel We stayed at this hotel in ember of  via an American Express promotion for a great price  We like to get away during Christmas  While not too far from our home Chicago around christmas is always nice to get away too The hotel is beautiful  The rooms are very modern and very spacious  I believe they are all suites  It is also right on Michigan Ave where all the shopping is  Parking was very steep in price  A tip we parked a couple blocks down the road in a public garage for about half the price  It was a little bit of a walk but we saved some money Flat panel TVs nicer restaurant great place  If this is good enough for Oprahs people its good enough for most of us   not be quite as nice as the Four Seasons never been there but perfect location meant a very nice time  
P => Superior service Stayed here for two nights for a girls getawayshopping spree  Found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating  Got a great rate that included parking and a voucher for the restaurant  Great location nice loyalty amenities and courteous staff all make this a property I will visit again  
P => Excellent location great service We found an amazing deal on Travelzoo for this hotel at  per night and booked one day in advance  We also took advantage of the reduced price for valet parking on Travelzoo at only  per night Every hotel employee we encountered was just wonderful  The suite was lovely and the combination of the service location and room was just unbelievable for the price Definitely sign up for the Select Guest program online  We saved lots of money and time with it  You get express check in and out robes in the room preferences for extra towels pillows etc  free wi fi free beverages in the morning and discounted breakfast items as well  With coffee juice bagels amp cream cheese our breakfast would have cost  each on the room service menu but cost us   per person as select guests The fitness centre seems very nice compared to others I have seen with complementary headphones and water  We just used the pool which was also nice though not large  And it is open from am to pm which is another fabulous extra  With our package we had  per day dining credit in the bar restaurant or room service  We used it on cocktails and appetizers one night before dinner  The food and service at the bar were great and the atmosphere was lovely The location is within walking distance of all the best shops restaurants and attractions in Chicago  We walked to Millennium Park Navy Pier and lots of great shopping amp dining  Chicago is a great friendly beautiful city and I m so happy we took advantage of this deal at the Omni to see it for the first time  We would return to this hotel again in a heartbeat Oh one more thing  We were on the th floor with a pretty nice view  The windows do open which was nice  But one morning we were awakened by construction below on Michigan Ave  They re tearing down the building next door so I imagine noise will be a problem for a while on that side of the building  
P => Incredibly accomodating to a Bachelorette crowd I hostessed a Bachelorette here last week and the hotel could not have been more accomodating They were very helpful and helping plan the night with where to go and what to do  They also send up some champagn to the room The room was very spacious and easily housed  of us for Bachelorette games The hallways could use a makeover as they dont look nearly as nice as the rooms  Thank you Omni for being a great place to stay 
P => Chicago Shopping Trip My dhter and I stayed here     on a shopping trip from Dallas  From the moment we pulled up until the time we left we enjoyed every moment here The employees were all very helpful and extremely courteous in a genuine way  We were encouraged to sign up for the Select Guest program and received complementary beverages each morning  The rooms are very nice and the beds extremely comfortable  We stayed on the th floor with a west facing room  We did not eat in the hotel as we had a couple of specific meal plans but the menu looked good  Parking is expensive and unless you plan on going far you are better off with taxis  This is the nicest Omni I have ever stayed at and I would highly recommend it to anyone 
P => Excellent hotel great deal terrific location We got a terrific price on a suite at the Omni Chicago after friends told us about a deal by using a promotion code from the Travel Zoo website  Booking with only  hours notice we got a beautiful suite on a Friday night  for only   Upon check in we were also given a  voucher to use towards food or drinks in the hotels  Restaurant  Our room was on the th floor with a south facing view over the city and was comfortable roomy modern and very clean  The hotels valet parking cost us  for the evening which is comparable to local parking garages but much more convenient  A definite highlight at the Omni is the  Restaurant on the th floor which has excellent views over Michigan Avenue  We enjoyed drinks at the  in the evening and a delicious brunch there the next morning  The brunch was only  per person and included a choice of organic meats and cheeses made to order omelets and a wonderful selection of fruits and fresh breads  All in all we were very happy with the Omnis service value and amenities  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and recommend it highly  As a native Chicagoan who enjoys frequent weekends at the Citys hotels I happily look forward to spending time at the Omni again  
P => Best Hotel Ever My husband and I stayed at the Omni with several other people from my workplace  It was awesome Incredibly friendly personnel without exception fabulous furnishings well appointed and spacious rooms and perfect location  The rooms had complimentary bath robes during our stay the best rainshower I have EVER used could I please take one of those home turndown service   we felt like superstars  The proximity to Michigan Avenue stores is WONDERFUL  We had a short walk to Water Tower Place and an inexpensive cab ride to Navy Pier Would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this hotel and cant wait to go back 
P => Great Location   Great Hotel I stayed in the Omni Chicago for  nights at the end of ust  The hotel location is great for shopping right in the centre of the main shopping street  The area is very up ket and we felt safe walking around during the day and late evening  Because of the location we were able to walk everywhere i e  John Hancock Navy Pier and State Street Shopping area  Although if needed there are plenty of buses from just outside the hotel serving all these locations We joined the hotels membership scheme free of charge which gave us free wifi a newspaper and a free drink in the morning  The room was superb a great size with a arate seating area and we were very high up which gave a great view of the John Hancock Tower We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning which although was quite pricey was convenient and there was a good selection of high quality food  The fresh fruit was particularly nice The staff were particularly helpful on arrival we couldnt get the TV to work so within  minutes a handyman was sent up to have a look and fixed it immediately  The reception and porters were very friendly always smiling and greeting us on arriving and leaving the hotel  The concierge was very helpful and assisted us in getting to Cellular field to see the baseball I would definitely stay here again if I return to Chicago and would recommend anyone going to stay here  
P => loved the location i booked this hotel simply because of where it is i have stayed in chicago before and fealt the hotel was too far out the rooms are a good sizethe breakfast is gooddinner is not worth bothering the cost is a lot and the menu is shortthe only downside is you have to change elevator to get to your room good of this is it will stop opportunist thieves but it is a pain 
P => The Omni was wonderful I booked my hotel room through Hotwire and saved a little bit as a result  The hotel staff had no prejudice as some places do for using a discount website  They merely said that the room was paid for and asked for a credit card to have on hold for any additional expenses  Very classy and warm  The room itself was fantastic  I signed up for their special preferred guest membership free on their website and enjoyed a complimentary  morning beverage  The turndown service was a nice addition  The view was spectacular  They put us on the top floor and we had a great view of the area  I would love to return to Chicago and would seriously consider staying here again  The pool was descent nothing to brag about  But their fitness and health area was top notch  
P => Great Experience Excellent experience at the Omni  Management has obviously sold the staff on the notion of being polite to guests and treating them right  The staff was extremely polite and helpful which I really appreciated  Everyone made eye contact smiled and said hello  Bell staff is very very helpful and courteous  Room service young man was out of sight polite  The gal who took our orders from room service also was out of sight polite We were on th floor  No street noise other than sirens which were only a few  Maid staff also did a very nice job and provided turn down service each night along with milk and cookies for our  children  Speaking of which all of the staff were very nice to our children  The  restaurant has kid menus for each meal  I would say it is a very kid friendly place I noticed a number of other families staying there  Be advised though that the quotpoolquot is basically a small lap pool but I think there is a problem if you bring kids to Chicago and they spend any chunk of time hanging out at the hotel pool Location was great   minute walk to the Navy pier and right in the heart of shopping  We took our kids to the Lego store just  blocks away This is our only visit to Chicago so I have no other hotel experience there for comparison but the Omni was terrific  Many kudos and thanks to the staff for their positive attitude and politeness  They made us feel very special and were just common folks 
P => Always a pleasant stay We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite  Location is superb staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying  Cornell at the front desk is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge  We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program high speed internet is gratis as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing  Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains We have never had a bad stay at this hotel  
P => Ideal location  We were in Chicago to see a Cubs ballgame and sightsee  Spent five nights at the OMNI and it was the perfect place  All staff were pleasant and courteous  The suite was oh so comfortable  The room was cleaned and made up daily and the bed turned down with a sweet treat every evening  Part of what made our stay so special was the delivery of morning coffee juice and a newspaper provided by the Omni Select Guest program The hotel is within easy walking distance of Chicagos public bus or train transit system  With the help of the consierge we were able to locate and take the red line train to Wrigley Field There are so many places to eat within walking distance of the OMNI  We very much enjoyed our breakfast at the  Restaurant and Bar in the OMNI  The filet mignon that my husband and I shared was very good and the green salads fresh and tasty  The chocolate tinis are so delishous The OMNIs right on the Magnificient Michigan Ave  so you can truly shop til you drop if youre so inclined  An easy two blocks down Michigan and you can pick up The Hop on Hop off Trolley or go up to the Hancock Observatory  For us this was the perfect location to enjoy Chicago  
P => wonderful hotel were treated like we were royalty At the last minute my son and I ided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs  After checking Priceline I ided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel  We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was readyI had called ahead and requested early arrival The front desk treated us like we were there best customers very friendly and accomodating  The room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel  The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable  There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review be those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their roomWe then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch  Our service was great as was the food  We also tried several restaurants around the Omni all within walking distance  The service cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible  We will definitely go back  
P => Bed Bugs  We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile  We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Maha after several voicemails  We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word  We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel  
P => Omni Chicago Heres What You Need to Know My wife and I stayed at the Omni for five nights over the Labor Day weekend  My conference was held each morning at a different hotel on Wacker Drive  I chose to stay at the Omni because of its superior location LOCATION The corner of Michigan Avenue and Huron  Look it up on a map  It is literally in the middle of the Magnificent Mile  Hotels south of the river  claim to be steps from Michigan Avenue but that is not the best part of Michigan Avenue  Restaurants are all around  There is a Walgreens one block away to pick up drinks and snacks ROOM This is an all suite hotel  Heres a tip Buy an Omni upgrade coupon on Ebay I paid  for mine so I paid  per night for a great upgrade be sure to check the expiration date  When booking let the hotel know you have a coupon and ask for the room upgrade  If you are booking months in advance you can even ask for the upgrade before you buy the coupon  We stayed in a corner Executive Level room on the rd floor Room   In addition to the King sized bed and the bathroom there was a sofa a club chair a sink a dining table with six chairs and  large windows  Our view was mainly to the north and the west  One couldnt see Lake Michigan from my room but it was high enough to see many other buildings  The bed was comfortable nice toiletries in room safe  I paid   taxes for this room  Check the hotel website for room specials AMENITIES Heres another tip  Join the Omni Select Guest program  The Omni Chicago doled out the benefits of this program better than any other Omni in which I have stayed  You get free in room wi fi complimentary coffee or juice delivered at your desired time complimentary newspaper  You can even request a high floor a corner room and extra towels The indoor pool is small but serviceable  Fitness center requires room key access FOOD We ate appetizers at  once picked up a flatbread pizza there once and had room service once  All were top quality STAFF The most courteous staff I have ever encountered  They always spoke to us on our way out or on our way back in  The doormen were helpful  Cabs are always available at the door MISC To get to a guest room from the street level one must take a first elevator to the rd floor where the front desk is located then go to a second bank of elevators that goes to floors    This zigzag elevator sequence turns off some of the guests but it ensures safety  It makes it difficult for someone to wander in off the street Overall an excellent stay  The only reason I wouldnt stay at the Omni would be if I wanted to pay  per night for the Peninsula or Four Seasons  That isnt going to happen  
P => Fabulous service I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel  I was completely impressed by the service all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding  I checked in quite early no problem and was efficiently checked in  My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener the ONLY negative from the entire stay which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows  I dont generally require much during my hotel stays but suffice to say the doorman housekeeping the night manager and bartender at  the day waiter at  and the concierge were amazing   I never waited more than about  seconds for anything  The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior  One very tiny complaint   there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar   had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenexcoffee paraphernalia  One wastebasket would make all the difference  All that said   what a great hotel Thanks Omni   I had a great stay 
P => class I stayed here on a business trip and like the other reviewers I found just about everything in this hotel to be top class  The on line check in really saved time as my key was waiting for me when I arrived  My room a suite was very large and clean  Even the bathroom was quotto scalequot  I ordered room service one night and found their pizza to be reasonably priced and delicious  The gym had some free weights and a few machines in addition to some cardio machines but here again the room was clean bright and had a nice patio  I didnt see the pool  All the employees were extremely friendly and ready to help  The hotels location on Michigan Ave is terrific right next to shops and restaurants  Id stay there again  
P => Loved The Omni Ill keep it short  My wife dhter and I stayed at this hotel for  nights  We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel  Location It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile Michigan Ave  so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do Hotel The hotel itself is very clean as were the rooms  Maid service was excellent including x daily cleaning and turndown service I think they missed a night Service Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind  They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile  Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room sometimes chocolates on our pillows  They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it  There was no shortage of people to ask things  My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get  They shouuld have more than one or longer hours Other We had breakfast in the  Restaurant and it was very good and well attended appointed  They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet  The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids  It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking  Pool and changing areas were spotless Room Clean sunny and spacious  Probably over  sq  ft     TVs couch desk chairs   all in perfect shape  The windows open for some fresh air  Pillows were pretty comfortable With all aspects considered I think this was an unbeatable value I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend  I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel  It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there  Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number  The airlines have cornered the ket on that  
P => Great location The Omni is located right in the middle of Michigan Avenue in the middle of all the action  Rooms are great all suites  Nice big bathrooms good linens and products  Staff there very nice and helpful  They have a breakfast buffet and a bar but I never checked it out  Also nice workout facility and indoor pool  You are walking distance to everything in Chicago  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Great Hotel  We stayed here in the middle of uary as we were guests on the Oprah Show  The hotel is beautiful  The service was great  Room was spacious and very comfortable  Plush bedding and mattress    The place to eat downstairs had great food nice atomosphere too   Staff very helpful and friendly  Complimentary Starbucks coffee downstairs in the lobby before  A M  was a plus The hotel is within walking distance to everything that you can possible imagine in the city  Would not hesitate to come back here   Great stay   
P => Great hotel We had a wonderful experience at this hotel  The room was very nice spacious and clean  The people were all so kind and helpful  The concierge proved to be invaluable  
P => Very good but frustrating This is a very nice hotel in a great location  The rooms are all mini suites with a bedroom area with its own TV that closes off from the sitting area  This was nice for us because I like to get up early and my wife prefers to sleep in a bit and its nice to have a hotel room where theres someplace aside from the bed and the desk to sit  The rooms are well equipped with plenty of storage space  The rooms with two doubles have a double set of drawers  Some rooms have pullout couches in the sitting area so its great if you want to share a room and still have a bit of privacy The problem is with the service  Ive never seen a ent hotel where the front desk is so underpopulated  When we arrived there were three groups in front of us and only one person at the desk  Several times I called the desk during the stay and got either no answer at all or an answer after well more than  rings The people are nice and try to be helpful but at one point we had arranged in advance to switch rooms and it took the desk clerk and the bell staff over an hour to find the record which they did ultimately find and get a bellman up to the room  This ruined an afternoon for us  Another time it took  minutes to get a cup of coffee to go at the restaurant because I wanted a muffin and they didnt haven any and instead of telling me they disappeared looking for one for  minutes One other complaint is with the room service menu which is seriously fussy and overdone  For example there is no club sandwich but a club sandwich panini with herbed cream cheese  The caesar salad came with a whole poached egg sitting on top I think with a small upgrade in staffing and organization this could be a superb hotel  As it is its just a good one  Id still recommend it but visitors should temper their expectations  
P => Perfect stay Stayed for  nights and had a room with a wonderful view up to lake Michigan  The staff has a way of giving you just the right amount of attention so you do not feel bothered but also never miss anything  This is complemented by the excellent location  One of the best downtown hotels in America  
P => Excellent location I stayed in the Omni hotel for  nights with my mother and sister  We found the Omni Hotel to be in an excellent location for shopping and visiting all the tourist attractions  The concierge Mellissa was very helpful and assisted with all our enquiries  Jared at reception was also very helpful with all our queries  The room was cleaned daily and in good condition  Sheets and towels were changed daily  The beds were comfy and there was no noise problems at night  I would advise anyone wishing to book this hotel to book via the hotel directly  I booked through a third party website and i would not do this again as the hotel room type I booked was not the one I recieved  I was informed by the hotel that when you book via third party you are placing a request and are not gauranteed the room type you book  All in all this hotel is a lovely one in a fantastic location  
P => Perfect Location   Great Staff The Chicago Omni is a great hotel located in the middle of North Michigan Avenue  Its staff are friendly attentive and caring  All of the service we received was great The rooms were very clean and had nice amenities  Our room was not as large as the ones shown on the internet site but was still more than enough space One minor drawback is that the lobby is on the third floor so to get to your room two elevator rides are necessary  This was not a big deal  The value offered by the summer rates at the hotel was also a bonus  
P => good location small suites The location is fantastic for shopping and some sightseeing  I loved that the hotel is small but right in the middle of the city with things to do right outside the door  The rooms are nice   but pretty small  The living area of my quotsuitequot had only two chairs and the bedroom part was pretty small  Seemed like if the wall was removed it would be a nice size regular room  When traveling to Omnis make sure you are an Omni Select member so you can have fresh coffee and water delivered to your room in the morning   its a nice way to start the day 
P => I Love This Hotel I stay at this hotel  times a year on business and LOVE itThe staff are great the rooms are spacious and clean and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership for free you get free wireless internet access  
P => Great location friendly service I stayed at the Omni from e   while attending a conference in Chicago  It was a great experience  The suites are very nice and well appointed  I was in a suite that had a king bed so the room with the bed seemed a little small but the amount of space in the suite overall was far better than a typical hotel room  The bed was very comfortable and they offered a choice of foam or feather pillows  The Select Guest program is a real treat  They give you a choice of two beverages and a newspaper and its delivered at the time you indicate on the card  It was awesome to wake up and have fresh coffee orange juice and a USA Today delivered to your room and it was all complimentary  Every staff member I spoke to was polite and friendly  The people stationed at the entrance always said hello with a smile and I thought it was a nice touch when they said quotWelcome backquot when you returned  Im very particular about cleanliness in a hotel especially if Im there for more than one night and I have to say that my suite was very clean  I didnt see any of the dustiness reported by other posters  My only complaint was that the hotel and the others on that part of Michigan Avenue are near the Northwestern Hospital and so as others have pointed out you might hear an ambulance with sirens blaring at any hour of the night  One night we counted  but two nights there were none  All in all we had an excellent experience at the Omni and would highly recommend it  
P => Fantastic hotel This hotel was absolutely fantastic  It was in a great location making it easy to get around central Chicago  The rooms were large and extremely comfortable and made for a really great stay over the Christmas period  The staff were friendly and we found the front desk particularly helpful especially in helping us get into restaurants with a large group  The facilities were great   I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Very Nice Location Its located right on the Michigan so its perfect for shopping and a good base for sight seeing  The train is a few blocks away and theres a bus stop right at the end of the block on Michigan  Walgreens Trader Joes and Whole Foods all within a  block radius well a little more for Whole Foods so you can pick up snacks and necessities Rooms I read some of the other reviews that had complaints  I didnt see any dust or dirt anywhere in my room   it was certainly clean enough for me The suite it is an all suite hotel was nice and big and furnished nicely with double beds sleeper couch  tvs etc  The bed was very comfy  The shower has adequate water pressure and the Omni provides bath salts so you can have a soak if youd like  My one tiny complaint is that I wish theyd stuck the one full length mirror they provide someplace other than behind the door and directly across from the commode  Its odd placement unless you like seeing yourself on the john and inconvenient when someone else is occupying the bathroom and youre trying to dress Service Everyone was friendly  I had an accidental mini bar charge on my card but they reversed with promptly and with no questions asked  Im a select guest member so I got free wireless internet access though I didnt use it the newspaper every morning and complimentary breakfast beverages  per room  If youre going to the Omni and havent signed up yet do it  Its free and worth the  minutes it takes to log on  They saved all my preferences corner room high floor feather pillows etc  and accommodated EACH one Now thats service Lastly the nightly turn down service with dessert mints is a nice touch after a long day  
P => Terrific Hotel The Omni is in a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue  Within just blocks are all types of stores including Saks Nordstroms HampM Filenes Basement Macys La Perla Apple Bloomingdates     I could go on and onThe room itself was fabulous  Comfortable nice big flat screen tvs nice sized bathroom They charge for Wi Fi but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration We got this hotel for night through Priceline and felt it was a terrific deal 
P => great location rough service This hotel has some issues at the front desk  To have one person handling checkouts at prime checkout time and NO backup is very regrettable Single file one at a time please  No it is inexcusable  At check out today there was no one at the supervisory level available only one desk clerk who was not up to the job  Allegedly the others were quotin a meeting quot The entrance to the hotel is poorly managed by the doorman with the result that guests are allowed to temporarily park hapazardly in the only entranceexit for taxis and other transport  A good property manages their front door to the house better than this one  The amount of open space in front of the hotel is very limited which makes managing the abandonment even temporary of vehicles in that space especially critical  The signage to get from ground level to checkin is miserable  One has no idea whether to go to floor  or floor  without spending time trying to figure it out because the brass plates on the elevator do not instantly identify which floor a new guest goes to  Hint checkin is on   The restaurant is on  but the guest services director at the desk right in front of checkin on  does NOT have the menu for the day  quotYoull have to up a floor sir and ask the hostess for the menu quot So just to find out what the restaurant serves one waits for an elevator goes up an entire floor and wastes time  Inexcusable bad service and poor property management because it can be fixed so easily with minor attention to detail  The area in the suite bathroom dedicated to the basin mirror etc is extraordinarly small narrow and cramped  There are inadequate power outlets here  A mouse would feel hump shouldered There is a signficant deficiency of electrical outlets all over the entire guest room except at the writing desk which has one extra outlet mounted on the edge  The room lamps appeared tohave three way bulbs and many of the settings are burned out making a guest think the entire lamp doesnt work until trying different combinations of the main switch at the entrance and repeatedly pushing the switch on the lamp to find the setting that is not burned out  Inefficient maddening and poor maintenance  Room service menu is  hour but heavily weighted to breakfast and sandwiches  Room service prices are of course extremely expensive  The food quality was above average and delivered in a reasonable time period  Room rates are steep for the quality delivered in the room  An inexperienced traveler  think its a quality location and hotel but there are much better properties available to the experienced business traveler and they deliver better value  The location is first rate however  
P => Great hotel great location I stayed at the Omni Chicago hotel in il  and was very impressed with the facilities and room The hotel is an all suites hotel  I had a corner suite on the th floor looking down Michigan Avenue The suites are of good size The living room had a good work space comfortable sofa and wall mounted LCD TV with HBO and ESPN and DVD playerthe bathroom is of good quality with plenty of towels and free toiletries the bathtub is better suited to showers than a long soakThe bedroom had a very comfortable double bed and plenty of clothes storage and a second TV The hotel restaurant served good food with fast service and the bar was small but good quality  The pool and gym are fine and in keeping with what I would expect for a hotel of this class and size  nothing earth shattering but adequateI joined the Omnis select Guest membership prior to visiting on their website this is free and entitles you to room preference and upgrade if available free wifi free newspaper and morning drink and free late check out The hotel is in a good location with plenty of shopping sights and bars within a couple of blocks  Taxis to the loop are about   
P => Central for the Chicago experience The Omni Hotel is located in a central part of Chicago  North Michigan Avenue  Its close walking distance to so many bars clubs and restaurants The hotel itself is clean and very comfortable  All the rooms are suites and there is ample room to work should you wish to The bed was comfortable and the batroomshower room provided just what was needed However I didnt spend an awful lot of time in the hotel I was out and about downtown Chicago The breakfast was excellent  You could pretty much create your ideal breakfast  The staff were attentive but not obtrusive The consierge in particular was very helpful and friendly If you visit Chicago and want to shop eat and generally soak up the sights and experience of the city this is a very good hotel for the  rate  
P => Great place on Michigan Avenue This is one of the nicest hotels Ive frequented  The staff was extremely friendly and housekeeping did a wonderful job during our three night stay  The hotel was very quiet while we were there  Housekeeping also brought our children warm cookies at night  My only gripe is that the bottled water appeared to be complimentary but it was not  it was  for a pint size bottle  Be very careful  Other than that the stay was great  
P => Very Pleased We stayed  nights at the Omni for quotSpring Breakquot and had a great time in spite of the snow  Location was perfect and having the suite set up worked well with the kids  Service was excellent   very friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the Select Guests benefits of free wireless internet and the morning beverage service with optional add on bagels for a fee  Cookies and milk were delivered with the turndown service  The cookies wont win any awards but it was a nice gesture  The pool is not as large or impressive as some but the kids enjoyed it every night nonetheless  Workout facility is on the small side but clean and well kept and I never had to wait for a treadmill there are   We will stay here again  
P => Tolerable Mix of Good Bad and Ugly The best part of my stay at the Omni for a conference held at the hotel was by far the hotel staff the front desk clerks were cheerful and efficient the concierge pleasant and helpful and the housekeepers responsive to requests  On the other hand the Omni is both the noisiest and dustiest hotel I have ever stayed in  It apparently is located directly on the hospital route   ambulances screamed by at all hours of the day and night  One night there was a weird drumming I am was on the th floor that lasted about  minutes during the day there was lots of drilling noise which presumably will go away once the reno is finished  The upside of the noise was that it provided unexpected entertainment  sitting on the toilet with a vent directly above it is possible to hear every single word of the conversations taking place in an adjacent room  An eavesdroppers delight Aside from the noise the hotel was dusty  everywhere  In my room in the conference meetings room the the bar in the business center  in short every facility I used at this hotel needed a thorough cleaning  When I checked into my room I opened the curtain behind the bed and to my disgust it seemed as if every previous tenant of the room had left his or her hand nose or lip print on the window  It was so gross I asked housekeeping to clean it up  which to their credit they did promptly What others have said about the weird layout of the rooms was true for me although it was not a major inconvenience or distraction  It did seem odd though that there was no light switch in the bathroom adjacent to the entry door from the bedroom side of the suite The location of this hotel is superb and its fine for what it is  a fair to middlin hotel  It is not four star and it is not luxe but it gets the job done  
P => Puts the Intercontinental to Shame On a recent trip to visit family in Chicago and Milwaukee I was able to stay at the Intercontinental in Chicago at the beginning of my trip and to stay at the Omni for my last night in Chicago Let me say for some reason they are ranked as  star hotels but the Omni is a TRUE  star hotel It made my experience at the Intercontinental seem like something you would get at a Holiday Inn The room a very clean functional modern and comfortable suite Room service food was promptly delivered of excellent quality and of the correct temperature Staff friendly and competent Location is perfect  Right in the middle of it all on North Michigan Avenue In short    when in Chicago stay at the Omni 
P => perfectly fine hotel arrived for  day visit to chicago with my  yr old dhter and good friend  stayed in a suite very ent price on th floor  room was fine for  of us  hotel staff were friendly and accomodating  perfect location for shopping or sight seeing  would certainly stay here again for location and price alone  we signed up to be a quotselectquot omni member before our stay and we got free coffee in the morning plus papers as well as free wifi  highly recommend becoming a quotselect preferredquot quest  just sign up on web site  We have stayed at Talbott before and loved it until construction caused lots of noise  cafe lux around corner as well as try quottempoquot for a great breakfast  have fun and enjoy  
P => Cant be beat Just returned from a quick business trip to Chicago and stayed at this property  We were on the th floor in a corner suite and it was great  The room was clean and the nightly turn down service was awesome The room had free WiFi and a great view overlooking Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown  The gym facilities and poolhot tub area are sufficient  My only complaint is the lack of quality concierge service  We were disappointed with every recommendation they made  Oh well a lesson learned there Overall a great place to stay  
P => Just OK I have stayed at the Omni a few times for Business  The lay out of the room is not very comfortable The big Flat Screen TV is across from this small uncomfortable sofa and in the bedroom is this old school small TV  Lots of small spaces and doors but it doesnt flow well  On this trip they were replacing all the in room safes and started working on this at am and they were very loud  Check in was fast and my bags were brought up quickly 
P => First class no complaints at all  Would recommend to everyone  My wife my two teenage dhters  amp  and I stayed at the Omni from th till th uary  on our first visit to Chicago  Apart from being delayed by a day at Manchester due to the incompetence of BMI our visit went off without a hitch  The OMNI does exactly what its says on the tin All Suites  My wife and I had one whilst the girls had another down the corridor th floor for super views  I had emailed the Hotel prior to arrival and let them know it was my dhters th whilst we were staying and they kindly left a birthday card and cake in her room whilst we were out  The location of the Omni could not be bettered halfway along North Michigan Avenue The Magnificent Mile and right in the midst of all the best shops  All the staff at the hotel deserve praise from the door staff to the reception staff  Every question was answered clearly and in a manner that showed that the staff really did care  It was a pleasure to enjoy the facilities in the room each night after many an hour spent shopping  The erate lounge with  easy chairs plasma TV and drinking facilities were very welcome as was the ice machine on the landing  
P => Great hotel great location fantastic staff Spent two nights at the Omni last weekend and loved it  First its an all suite hotel so lots of room private bedroom large sitting area desk amp bar  Two TVs and very comfortable beds I loved it and wouldnt hesitate to return again  I found my room to be very clean no dust issues and all the fixtures appeared to be in tiptop shape Staff from the doormen front desk maids and the concierge was all top notch very helpful  Got some great dinner suggestions as well as helpful hints on how to get where I needed to go  Location was perfect right on Michigan avenue  Walking distance to the red line subway and also the great shopping that the magnificent mile has to offer  Didnt visit the pool or work out facilities so cant comment on that  You will hear the street noise but remember you are on Michigan avenue and shouldnt be surprised by the occasional police siren  Only reservation was the heater had it set to  and still had on a sweater  The poor thing never turned off but should also mention Chicago was in the middle of a cold wave  and the temperature outside hovered at  below most of the time I was there All in all Ill be back 
P => Convenient cosy Stayed a week with my wife and  children  Prime location very friendly and helpful staff  Clean nice   high standing but never stuffySuite setup let kidsparents sleep in different roomsPool and jaccuzzi nice for families  rarely crowded Sign up to become a quotselect guestquot free and get complimentary beverages in roomIn room dining menu limited  
P => An Okay Stay I tend to agree with the previous review   great location but overpriced hotel  I had to move rooms because of the incredibly loud noise when on a lower floor     ambulance and police sirens blaring all night long  I also found the accommodations somewhat quottiredquot worn carpeting stained walls  Signed up for the Select Guest program but never actually received any extra perks   no morning beverage or newspaper delivery  
P => Awesome hotel  Location is great  Food is excellent hotel is fantastic 
P => The Omni Perfect location beautiful accommodations My dhter and I stayed at the Omni for the Holidays Lights Festival  I have stayed at four different hotels each time I have visited Chicago and the Omni has been the best so far  Its right in the middle of the action   it was great to walk out the lobby and be within steps of Michigan Ave  the hotel sits on MIchigan but lobby entrance is on Huron  Every staff member I met was friendly and professional  I requested a room with a view and received a room on the th floor with a fantastic view of the John Hancock Building  The double room suite was spacious and very clean  Housekeeping was excellent and the room smelled fresh each time we came back from an outing  I had read through another review on Trip Advisor to sign up for the Select Guest program and Im glad I did  Check in was a breeze and it included complimentary beverages in the morning with the option of purchasing individual items such as bagels and muffins for a reasonable price  The hotels special touches during the Holiday Lights Weekend were a real treat  On Sat  morning as we headed out to shop coffee a rich delicious hot chocolate drink and mini pastries were available in the lobby  The night of the parade they opened up their third floor board room with floor to ceiling windows for guests and offered complimentary hot beverages and sugar cookies during the parade  It was all very festive The hotel offers express check out through voice mail which was convenient and the night before we left the front desk called to see if we needed boarding passes printed or any help with our departure  I thought that was a very nice touch The only problem we encountered was with the hotels restaurant  In regard to what we were charged for the buffet  I made note of this on the comment card at departure and within a day received an e mail from the director of food and beverage who quickly resolved the situation I am impressed with the Omni Hotel    perfect location beautiful clean accommodations friendly staff and quick to respond to and resolve a guests concern  
P => Classy act Just returned from a memorable weekend in a fabulous city made even better by staying at this first rate property  We are Omni fans  Their properties are lovely have the best locations and their staff make your stay rekable  This one is the best so far  I cant say enough about how amazing the staff were how eager to help us make arrangements solve little problems and generally make us feel special  When I wasnt too happy about the low location of our original room overlooking the stores across the street we were moved up to a high corner suite with panoramic views of the city When we checked in we were offered free cocktail coupons for the bar and breakfast credits of  per day  The concierge steered us to fabulous restaurants the desk staff were most helpful and they even offered us the hotel limo to take us to the Art Institute when we asked directions A lot of this  have been timing and luck but we were in heaven all weekend because of the hospitality offered by this hotel  I think attitude can help you get a good hotel experience      we were grateful and patient and found it really helps  For example we arrived in the morning and wanted to check in before our room was ready so a younger desk person gave us the lower room to oblige us  When we went back to the desk rather than complaining or being hostile we simply asked if anything could be done in a cheerful way and a more experienced and higher ranking staff member bumped us up and offered us the coupons  We had a little problem with water pressure in our shower and within  min  a team of repairmen was sent up to remedy the situation  Yes there was a lineup at the concierges desk on occasion but what can you expect You arent the only one asking for help  The wait staff at the bar and in the restaurant were terrific and so was the breakfast We were overwhelmed by the courtesy and kindness of everyone we encountered at the Omni and in Chicago and cant wait to go back 
P => Fantasic hotel highly recomended We have just returned from a fantastic trip to the USA Chicago New York Boston and then a week on the Cape We started our trip in Chicago  We stayed  nights in Chicago and we arrived in a downpour due to the hurricane that had passed close to Chicago  The hotel staff were extremely helpful and met us at our taxi with an umbrella and took care of all the luggage  The room was fantastic  We had a corner suite It was located on the th floor  The views were stunning with a view of the Magnificent Mile  It feaured a full length window above the bed which was just amazing  The room was a good size and had flat screen T V  in the living area  We arrived very tired and ordered room service which arrived prompt and was really nice and my partner had a pizza was jumbo  We did not eat in the hotel but it looked very nice  We had breakfast in a fantastic place in Chestnut Street just a few blocks away i can not remember its name but you cant miss it as there is always a queue but well worth the wait  We loved the Omni Chicago and will defenatly return 
P => Best hotel experience yet My new husband and I stayed here for a week during our honeymoon trip to Chicago  From the moment we arrived the hotel staff were welcoming and extremely helpful The room was magnificent  It was located on the th floor and had windows facing east with a view of the Magnificent Mile  It feaured a full length window above the bed which was just amazing  The bathroom was a good size for the room and TVs in both the living area and bedroom were a nice touch The best thing about the hotel was the staff  The bellmen and hotel driver went out of their way to make our stay the best it could be  We dined twice at the hotels restaurant   The food was outstanding and the view of Michigan Ave  at night was superb  The staff were friendly and provided the best service possible The fitness center was very nice and the available lemon water was refreshing We love the Omni Chicago 
P => Awesome hotel in Chicago This hotel is top notch Beginning with the bell man  We stayed at the Omni hotel on   th  The bell man spent a great deal of time explaining where to find things what was close to the hotel etc  Check in is at pm however our train arrived at  in the am so our plan was to just drop off our luggage and shop  Our room was ready early Overall the room was very nice had adequate living room with chairs desk bar and plasma tv on wall  The king size bedroom suite was very spacious and comfortable  Probably the most sleep I have ever gotten in a hotel  The bathroom had all the little touches even ribbons tied around the extra toiletries  Robes in the room even milk cookies and chocolates at turn down service The hotel had a nice workout room with water fruit etc  The swimming pool was just a ft  depth but adequate for my dhter  Had hot tub and a walk out for sunbathing on the th floor My only complaint was the first conceirge wasnt real helpful  He gave me less information that I already knew about the city  The hotel had a restuarant food appearance was excellent prices a little high for breakfast and service was a little off than what I thought it should be  But overall very nice The hotel is located right on Michigan Ave great resturants in the area and located near all the great shopping within walking distance Would highly recommend 
P => Best location Stayed at the wonderful Omni You could not ask for a better location  cus concierge gave us friendly and helpful dining recommendations and took care of our reservations  Breakfast was fantastic in their restaurant  Cage free eggs and such   good stay  
P => Loved the Omni We drove up in front of the Omni Hotel and valet parked our car per day  The bell staff outside was very friendly and efficient  When you need your car you are asked to call ten minutes in advance  Our car was always ready by the time we came down  We also took cabs from the front of the hotel  There was never any wait Check in is on the third floor  Again the staff was friendly and efficient  I reserved two rooms one for my husband and me plus a second for my parents  Our rooms were on the th floor  The elevators were quick The rooms are all suites and very luxurious  In the living room there is a wet bar and a quot flat screen TV  There was a desk for our laptop and the hotel is WIFI  Instead of a couch there are two nice chairs with ottomans  The bedroom area has a second TV and robes in the closet  The bed and pillows were so comfortable  The bathroom is a good size with a very nice shower  The rooms were very quiet I am a Select Omni Member so in the morning coffee with warm cream was delivered to our rooms  In the evening there was turn down service with cookies and milk for a snack delivered  They also filled the ice bucket  Very nice touches We enjoyed the breakfast buffet on Saturday  It was well worth the price which included your beverage  The food was organic and omlets were made to order  I selected the pancakes which were very light  I topped them with fresh raspberries  After walking the Mag Mile we ided to stop back at the OMNI for lunch  The service was good and the luncheon menu was interesting  I had a salad that came wrapped in a little bowl which was actually a cucumber  My husband had lobster rolls  For Chicago I thought the prices were reasonable On our second day we attended a wedding  After the service we returned to the hotel  Cails and horderves were served on the third floor  The service was great and the horderves were delicious  The reception was on the fourth floor and again the food was excellent The morning after the wedding the new Mr  amp Mrs  hosted a breakfast buffet  The food was so good especially the french toast  The coffee at the OMNI was always very good  I think I remember seeing a Starbucks sign on one of the big pots at this breakfast The location of the OMNI is perfect  You walk out the front door and make a right and you will find yourself in the middle of everything Staying at the OMNI was a wonderful experience  
P => Very nice one weekend day in Chicago  Having stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn before I thought Id step it up a bit and go for the Omni  Found the place after parking in a meter spot free on Sunday and walking six blocks  Walked into the first floor stand and asked about checking my bag as it was am  The young lady and bell person said the lobby was on the third floor and they would probably be able to check me in early  I really didnt believe them thinking they should have checked my bag but I get to the third floor ask about a early check in and could not believe I got in at am  To the th floor typical Omni rooms seem to be better built better quality overall  The pics are an actual depiction  Walk four blocks to the Red Line and Jewels Osco Superket  Went to New Comisky and returned after the game  Felt tired as I had been up since am and ided to order pizza  The delivery guy must have gotten stopped because I got a call from guest services inquirying if I ordered food which I said quotOf course deep dishquot so this hotel is up on their security  Recieved another call later in the evening about transportation the next morning from the front desk and I lined as I had it planned  I woke up at am again to go to the fitness center  This kinda mean lady told me it was open at am  Ive stayed at other Omnis and they would call security to open the room just for me  Not this lady  I asked about printing a boarding pass and she points me to the business center which charges  per  minutes  I read in previous reviews the front desk printed boarding passes but not the night time desk lady  She looked like she could have killed me for bothering her so thats why four instead of five stars  Overall another solid stay at the Omni except for you know who  
P => Great hotel right in the middle of everything you can walk to We used hotwire to get a good deal for a very special st Anniversary evening  And we got a great deal and the hotel I really wanted Omni Chicago  The hotel was a  star hotel with all of the perks  Check in was fast and we were greeted with a glass of champaign  I told them it was our anniversary ahead of time and they gave us a corner suite with an unbelievable view of Michigan Ave and the Hancock building  The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable  We signed up with Omnis Select Guest program   a great extra perk  They provide a turn down service and your choice of complimentary beverages in the morning  After coming back from dinner there was a wonderful piece of chocolate cake in our room with Happy Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate  A VERY nice added touch We used the workout facility in the morning had everything that one would need but did not use the pool the only thing that did not impress us  It was very small and the space needs a little more TLC  Check out was a breeze and we were given a bottle water upon check out  The only other negative would be how much valet costs   Crazy expensive  I would suggest to use the over night parking garage near the Peninusula Hotel  for the night  But overall I give the hotel service and ammenties an A  Thank you for a wonderful Anniversary 
P => The perfect stay We stayed at the Omni to celebrate our anniversary    we made one simple mention of our anniversary at check in and they moved us to the top floor for the best view and we had chocolate cake with fruit and a card waiting for usThe room was superb Exactly what was expected from looking at the picturesWe ate breakfast at the restaurant  I believe it was called The food and the service was magnificentThe staff always greeted us with friendly hellos and it seemed they truly were quotat our servicequotThe trip ended with wonderful valet service We called down ahead as we were told to do for the quotquickestquot service we waited less than  minutes for our car and we were each given a bottle of Evian for our waitA 
P => Excellent service   spacious room I stayed at the Omni for two nights this week as part of a conference  I found out the week before checking in that members of their Select Guest program get all sorts of free stuff  Signing up is free   and I got free internet free drinks in the morning hot and cold   in my case it was OJ and Evian and you can upgrade to add a bagel or muffin for just  free newspaper and upgraded to a higher floor I had a suite with two double beds on the th floor  I enjoyed having a suite rather than just a room  The living room was a good size with a very nice plasma tv and a mini bar area with sink  The bedroom was a good size considering it was the city with a nice bathroom With the exception of one woman at the front desk the staff couldnt have been more helpful  They called to offer to print my boarding passes the night before I left   a big help rather than dealing with the business center The fitness center was nice and clean   with towels and water with lemons  Several treadmills an eliptical machine and other machines as well as weights and open space for jumping rope or whatever  Didnt see the pool I ate at the  restaurant   very good very pricey  Great presentation of the food Great location right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile Aside from the price which I understand is rather steep for Chicago I would definitely stay here again 
P => One of the best in Chicago I picked the Omni Chicago for our vacation hotel as I was already familiar with it as far as the location on Michigan Avenue  When I compared the rate to the other upper end hotels in the area it seemed the best value for the money  After our stay y    th  I think it was a wise choice  The Omni couldnt have a more convenient location  Huge choice of restaurants stores and transportation literally at your front door  I have to comment on some of the complaints as far as the lobby being on the third floor and then the necessity to take a second elevator to the rooms  This arrangement to me made me feel much more safe and it also made it feel a bit more exclusive  I didnt find the arrangement to be at all inconvenient and actually preferred it  Entrance and lobby very elegant  Absolutely the most effortless check in Ive experienced  Nothing to sign just accept the keys and go  I did register with the Omni Select Guest program which I recommend  I believe that expedited check in  Bonus with Select Guest is complimentary morning beverage service delivered to your door with your choice of two beverages and newspaper  A to Omni for that perk Our room number  was extremely spacious and comfortable  Very nice or furniture in very good condition  Great granite topped wet bar in the living room  Bedroom is not large but certainly adequate  I appreciated the eration of the rooms  Great if one of the travelers wants to rest while the other doesnt  Bed was very plush and comfortable  More drawer storage space than I could imagine anyone needing  Two robes in the bedroom closet were appreciated  The living room was very roomy with two chairs an ottoman wall mounted plasma TV and work desk  Bathroom nicely done in ble and granite  Nice large and thick bathtowels  The Omnis rooms could actually be used as a temporary apartment and are in fact larger than most studio apartments Ive lived in in the past  I really liked the overall design and configuration of the room  Noise was not an issue although we were on the th floor which  have helped with lack of street noise  Windows can be opened a bit for fresh air  One suggestion is that two ottomans in the living room would be nice so that each chair has its own  Staff overall was excellent professional and very well trained  With one exception one of the doormen tall guy with a bluetooth headset on amp an attitude everyone greeted us with a smile and hello  We ate breakfast in the dining room several times  As always in a hotel it was pricey but I would rather pay a bit more for the convenience of not having to wander around looking for food in the morning  The food itself was excellent as was the service  Terrific view overlooking Michigan Avenue from the table too  The bar and restuarant were quite beautiful  Extra nice large and well equiped workout facilities with locker rooms  Pool area was large and clean  I used both the pool and spa and enjoyed it  Note there is no sauna as is advertised on several websites  There are also two spacious outdoor ks overlooking the city off the pool and workout areas  All in all was extremely pleased with the Omni Chicago and would highly recommend it  Try booking directly with the hotels website for the best deal  Check the Senior rates or AAA rates if you are able to use those  This hotel would be my first choice on return visits to Chicago  Kudos to a well run hotel  
P => Great Location Nice location on the Mag Mile  The Omni lobby is on the rd floor so to get to the guestrooms you have to take two different elevators to get there  Check in was smooth  If you book through Omni be sure to sign up for the Omni Select Guest program Free  Not only do you get a complimentary beverageup to two each day you also get complimentary wireless internet access  The beds were very comfortable and turndown service was a nice touch The room service was great  Big portions and great staff  Restaurants  Tapas Bar is incredible  located a couple of blocks away from the Omni  I definitley recommned trying them for dinner  Inexpensive and the best Tapas Ive ever had  
P => Great stay at Omni My wife and I just shared our anniversary at the Omni Chicago  Every thing was perfect  The staff and service was great from check in to check out  Excellent suite with flat screen TV  Best location on N  Michigan Av  in the heart of the Magnificent Mile  I highly recommend this property which is now my favorite in Chicago  
P => Dont bring a car to the Omni I have stayed at the Omni in Chicago a couple of times and always have a good experience  The rooms are very clean and the bed is oh so comfortable  You can only valet park at a cost of  per night as there is no self parking for the hotel so I would recommend that you not bring a car to the Omni  
P => Nothing Special We stayed at the Omni with our young son the beginning of e  I will say that I am a hotel snob so my standards are pretty high The first thing I was surprised about was that for a suite the room was actually quite small  Really no bigger than any other hotel room and was just called a suite because the doors arate the bedroom and sitting room  The bathroom was likewise quite small in my opinion  Bathroom extras were not anything to write home about just generic hotel shampoo etc  The closet was pretty tiny we couldnt really fit both our suitcases in there  Also there is no small convenience store in the building that I could find at least so that you either had to walk several blocks to the walgreens or suffer the stiff prices of the mini bar if you wanted a drink or snack  That would be a nice addition  On a good note the hotel breakfast was excellent the rooms were clean and housekeeping was prompt  We arrived quite late and they had made sure a crib was waiting in the room so that we could get the little one to bed ASAP  We had a lovely view of the lake and the city from our rd floor room  The location was outstanding as well pretty much right in the heart of everything  We were easily able to walk to Navy Pier and the river as well as take advantate of all the fantastic shopping in the area  Small note sign up for the Omni guest program and get free internet in the room and perhaps a better room at check in  All in all it was a pleasant experience but I was far from blown away by the Omni  
P => Hotel of choice in Chicago I typically stay at the Omni in Chicago when on business and am never disappointed  The rooms are spacious with flat screen TVs and comfortable lounging chairs  The king sized beds are very comfortable as are the pillows  The bathrooms are large and well equipped This particular stay I was in room  which happens to be next to the fitness center   you can definitely hear the whir of treadmills and elliptical machines from inside the room  Also it was not the greatest location as the room windows actually looked out onto the public sunk  But still a very nice room  AND I checked in so early that this was the only room available One other issue with the mini bar   I was in the mood for some chocolate   both choices for chocolate that I opened were too old to eat the chocolate had an awful white film on it and probably had been sitting there for many months For business travelers and tourists this is in a great location on Michigan Ave   and the free coffee in the mornings is a great touch  
P => Perfect Location This hotel is the perfect location for downtown Chicago shopping  The only thing is the pool is extremely small   it is indoors but looks much larger on the website  
P => Great hotel This a great property excellent location and wonderful staff  Everyone was very accommodating and polite  The room I had was on the rd floor and was like a suite with a living area and a bedroom  The living room was spacious with a plasma TV a desk and a couch  The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality  In the closed they placed an umbrella which came in handy it rained the whole time I was in Chicago  The internet connection is  hrs  Great place I will return for sure  
P => Fantastic Service This was our first time to Chicago and we really enjoyed this hotel  The room was a great size with a lounge area and nice views  The location could not have been better right on Michigan Avenue perfectfor shopping restaurants and visiting the Hancock Building  The famous Uno pizza restaurant is right around the corner  The staff were really helpful the doorman always remembered us  The restaurantand bar were really good   you can sit and eat overlooking Michigan Ave below  Gym was small but functional  Would recommend  
P => Omni   Chicago is very nice I stayed here for a conference in early il   I loved this hotel  the room was big had three arate rooms ample workspace plasma TV in the main room regular tv in the bedroom The staff was friendly and attentive and the location is amazing   just off the magnificent mile  feet and close to the Apple store My only quibble was that I had to take a first elevator to the rd floor front desk and then get into another elevator to get up to my floor  A little inconvenient and if the hotel got busy which it didnt things might have slowed down a lot  I would stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Excellent Location Great Rooms We ided to get away for a quick weekend and chose the Omni Chicago due to the photos we saw online and the very reasonable room rate which was  per night  The actual room did not disappoint  The room was very large and had plenty of space  The bathroom was large and very accomodating  There were good size windows in both the living area and bedroom  The bedroom has its own set of doors closing it off from the living area  The living area was okay the flat screen on the wall was nice but considering the actual sofa in the living area was uncomfortable and on the cheaper side I think the flat screen would have been better served in the bedroom versus the TV that was in there it was a regular TV inside of a wall unit with several drawers built into the wall  We chose to watch the TV in the bedroom versus the living area since it was much more comfortable  The king size bed was very comfortable and the bedding was nice although they could have used a few more pillows for sleeping other than the many orative pillows on the bed  The comforter was really nice and warm  The heating system in the room was excellent  The many ammenities in the room were very thoughtful there was an umbrella in the closet spray starch for ironing etc  All the little things most places dont even think of  We had left the privacy sign on our door because we did not want housekeeping that day but when we returned we found out that they had come in anyway a big turn off in my opinion  If you desire no housekeeping make sure you tell the front desk in addition to leaving the sign on your door We did not use the gym pool or jacuzzi while we were there but we found that they were very popular among the other guests  The pool and such are on the th floor  They seemed to be pretty clean and you could smell the strong odor of chlorine all throughout the th floor as soon as you stepped off the elevator but not once you got into your room My only complaint about the hotel not a real big deal but you have to use two elevators to get to your room  One takes you to the lobby area where you walk a bit around the corner and get on another elevator to get to your floor  Also if you have your own car be prepared to pay  a night for overnight parking  We took our chances and found free after hours on weekend street parking less than a half block from the hotel  The doormen are very friendly and helpful  Overall I would definitely stay at the Omni again as its pricing is very good and the location is great  
P => One of my favorite Chicago hotels Great hotel in heart of Chicago for business or pleasure  Rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large  Flat screen TVs ble baths all rooms are suites great desk kitchenette comfortable bed free wireless internet    everything you could ask for  Location is easy walk to Magnificient Mile and lots of great restaurants  Staff is friendly and helpful  Short cab ride to Loop  
P => Wonderful Just got back from the coldest weekend ever in Chicago The rooms and the service were awesome The staff at the Omni made us feel so welcome and they were very accommodating  The only think I was disappointed about was the pool  It needs to be repainted  If you can look past the paint peeling at the bottom of the pool youll enjoy the water The temp  was perfect The hot tub was a great night cap to a cold day I would go back to the Omni in a heartbeat  Its got the perfect location on Michigan Ave  I booked the trip on NWA Cyberfares   it was fantastic 
P => Excellent stay My husband and I spent the night in Chicago at the Omni Chicago   to    Excellent stay beginning with check in  The woman at the Front Desk was very friendly helpful and fast  Our room was spacious very clean and with all the amenities  We left for most of the day and when we returned our bed was turned down with little chocolates on our pillows and the hotel robe laying on the bed for our use if we choose  The bed was very comfortable the pillows were ok  Still we had a great night sleep  In the morning we ate at their restaurant they had a breakfast buffet but we ordered off the menu  Everything was delicious and the wait staff was excellent  We would definately stay at this hotel again  We used Express Checkout and left  Staying in a great hotel can make all the difference in how well you enjoy your mini trips  PS  We saw quotWickedquot it was excellent 
P => Excellent weekend Took my  dhters to Chicago for an American Girl Weekend  We stayed in a premium suite which was perfect   double beds plus a sofabed  Wet bar fully stocked mini bar  tvs nice bathroom   Service was excellent  Everyone was friendly and eager to help with anything we needed  Called for extra pillows and they arrived in minutes  Free morning beverage service is nice touch for select guests  Called for extra beverages in a m and again they arrived in minutes  Pool was small but more then adequate for the kids  Exercise facility was very nice  Plenty of cardio machines a rack of dumbells and a few hammer strength machines  Location was perfect for American Girl store only a block and a half away   Would definetly stay here again 
P => great stay    From a single male travelers perspective in for a fun weekend in Chicago the Omni was great all the way around  I had an early a m  flight into OHare and rode the train downtown which brought me to the Omni at about  a m  I went in expecting to only be able to check my bags with the bell desk but I was able to get into my room immediately  The front desk staff was cordial and efficient The room was excellent  Clean nicely appointed and comfortable  Plasma TV is great bed really comfortable  When I noticed there wasnt any shampoo in the bathroom I asked a housekeeper in the hallway if she could get me some and after seeing she didnt have any on her cart she went to the stockroom and delivered it in about two minutes  Location cant be beat  Yeah the two elevator thing is somewhat of a drag but I never had to wait more than  seconds for an elevator over the course of    days  You are walking distance to pretty much everything downtown or at most a  cab ride Only one minor complaint about the room which other reviewers have noted  the refrigerator seems to run very warm  I didnt utilize the mini bar but was going to try to put some leftover deep dish in there but didnt trust the temp  Got a styrofoam cooler around the corner at the Walgreens and filled it with ice instead for my refrigeration needs Wake up calls came on time housekeep was unobtrusive and respected the Do Not Distrub sign when I slept in on Saturday Friends who I was meeting in town were staying at House of Blues hotel and were quite jealous of my room at the Omni  I look forward to staying there again  
P => Omni was great    I love Chicago Stayed here with my boyfriend    arrived in the afternoon and the bell boy took care of our luggage from our driver  Took the lift to the rd floor to check in  We had a corner room on the th floor  Everything was great in the room nothing to complain about  Went out to eat that night and when we came back the housekeeping had been for the turndown service and all towels replaced House keeping service the room twice daily  Requested a late check out of pm and that was no problem at all  Only one thing though   House keeping accidently took my towel as it was on similar colour They offered to wash it and bring it back but I didnt want it back  All in all the hotel is in a great location room are niceand clean the beds super comfy and shower had good pressure and always had hot water and the staff are polite  When we left   had the bell boy take our luggage to hold onto till we left  Chicago is an abosolutely amazing city and I will definately be returning soon If youre there over the weekend be sure to visit the Grand Lux Cafe for breakfast Yum 
P => Horrible experience We stayed here for a wedding and had nothing but problems  First we were told that we had to stay for  nights instead of just   The bride and groom handled this and got us a discount  However when we got there they couldnt find the reservation and the already stressed bride called the hotel again and spent about  minutes on the phone going thru confirmation numbers and who she spoke to and when  They FINALLY got this taken care of and we got the  bedroom suite which was nice for the four of us  However it stops there  The water pressure was about like someone spitting on you  We had the do not disturb sign on teh door but housekeeping proceeded to try and key into the room  The location is nice as you are in the heart of everything but that is all it had going for it  I called a couple days after we left to voice my concerns  I didnt want anything but possibly an apology to the newlyweds who had to deal with this the day of their wedding I left voicemails on  different peoples phones never got a response so I kept calling  FINALLY I reached a very rude person who said that it wasnt their fault  It was the new people they had just hired who didnt know how to put the data into the computer and WHO hired these people  Very sad that we had to have such a horrible experience on a lovely wedding weekend  
P => Great Location and Service My husband and I just returned from the Omni  We were there for just a  night stay   ember    Since it was a holiday weekend the hotel and the rest of the city was jammed  Our experience there was wonderful  We had a prompt and friendly check in  Our room was very comfortable and clean  Beautiful granite counters in the bathroom pillow top beds and the living area were especially nice to relax in  I would encourage anyone who is considering a stay at the Omni to join the Select Guest program they offer  Its free and little amenities like juice and coffee delivered to your room free in the morning are really nice  We called on the Concierge both Amiri and Kevin several times and each time they were able to help us and direct us to great restuarants activities etc  Both were very helpful and Amiri was kind enough to see that we got a wonderful bottle of wine or champagne on our anniversary  Ifwhen we return to Chicago I would most likely stay at the Omni again especially if we could get the same great rate  
P => Weird room set up Check in is on the second floor and then you take additional elevators to get to your room so bring a suitcase with wheels  The bed was amazing although they only gave you  pillows per bed which made reading a little cumbersome  The room is set up very weird you cant see the TV from the bed  Its an amazing flat screen televion which is bolted to the wall and the only way to see it is by sitting on the  chairs near the window  We rented a movie and actually moved the bed so we could see the TV  The concierge was very helpful and knowledgable  The front desk was not polite to say the least  I asked for a wine opener and it took  days before I finally got one after asking  times  I guess I wasnt a priority in their eyes  The desk did not have an extra plug for my computer so I had to use it on another seat  They do have wireless internet  The location is excellent for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave  The bathroom was good but the closet was in the bathroom which again was a little weird  Overall Id say the location was excellent but the hotel needs someone to make some ergonomic changes  
P => Two Thumbs Up Just returned from a X Mas three day stay       st class all the way  Located right in the heart of shopping it was a weekend of fun  An all suites hotel the rooms were very comfortable with excellent housekeeping  The turndown service with the little extras weather report and chocolates were a nice surprise  Checked out the restruant a couple times for breakfast and was pleasantly satisfied  The staff especially the door staff recognizes you by name after awhile  Two thumbs up Only negative would be the valet parking  pday  However we stayed  nites and were only charged for  days parking  I am sure the rate at other downtown hotels would be the same  Conceriege was great in making reservations     
P => A suite deal My husband and I booked a last minute deal on a weekend stay at the Omni and it was much better than expected  From the minute we walked in the service was great  Our room was changed to a corner suite when we did not like the location of our first room  We asked for extra towels and housekeeping sent someone with a huge stack  The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable  The Valet parking is   but that is pretty much par for the course in this area of hotels  The restaurant is nice for breakfast though a bit expensivebut worth it  I really liked the idea of the suite it felt like there was a lot of room and there was a plasma t v The location certainly cant be beat  All in all for a night in the city this was an excellent choice 
P => A good value We have stayed at many of the moderately priced hotels in the neighborhood including the Westin Hyatt Sheraton Radisson Courtyard Fitzpatrick Doubletree Drake and Wyndham  The Omni is a favorite  All of these hotels place you just steps from the heart of the Michigan Ave shopping area  For the money make sure you add in a   nightly parking fee the Omni delivers a more upscale experience  Unlike the other hotels listed most of the rooms here have a view of the city that is spectacular  The quiet rd floor lobby common areas pool whirlpool and exercise rooms are very nice  The valet bellman and front desk service along room service meals were just fine  The staff without exception were very pleasant  The rooms include a large plasma TV a spacious suite configuration and a nice bath and pantry area with ble counters  The sitting room could have used another chair but the desk and couch were adequate  The carpeting in the rooms was a little worn and drab and the woodwork  doors showed some scuff ks but otherwise there was nothing negative about the environment  The sitting room could have used another chair but the desk and couch were adequate  If you are traveling alone on business the Wyndham is less expensive and a very nice choice  If you are traveling with children and could use extra space or if you are looking for something a little nicer the Omni is well worth the money  
P => Very comfortable We were there as part of a convention so we got a great deal on rates  The rooms were well appointed  The bedroom itself is small but with the sitting room there was plenty of space  The thing I liked most and this is minor was that the shower curtain is on a rounded rod so it gives the illusion that the tub is bigger than it is but the curtain doesnt touch you at all ewww when you are showering  I had room service several times and they were very prompt and it was a nice presentation  Ate in the on site restaurant twice    good but pricey  Looked like they needed more business  Nice view of Michigan Avenue  The desk staff was a little stuffy but the doormen were very helpful and friendly  One doorman replaced my Omni supplied umbrella when the quotwindyquot city shredded it  One thing that surprised me was there isnt much of a lobby area you have to go up an elevator from the street to check in which is a little confusing until you get the hang of it  Small added bonus Michael Jordan has an office in the adjoining building half the hotel is offices and I glimpsed him one morning  Was hoping for Oprah but that didnt happen  
P => Shwanky The Omni is right in the heart of things and is very upscale  It is an all suite hotel and I had one of the basic ones called a deluxe king suite I think  I got a good rate for the dates and star level through hotwire so I was a little concerned but I neednt have been  It is absolutely clean  It is very roomy with deluxe bedding upscale designed wood ble and granite everywhere  Plasma TV in the sitting room and another TV in the bedroom free wifi  It was very roomy  Great Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room  A CD player in the alarm clock  Electronic temp control  Wetbar  I enjoyed the view from the th floor  The artwork in the elevator and lobby were probably done in China in a factory to look like real artwork yuck  I thought the desk people were ent but I felt there was a general lack of warmth and helpfulness that was so evident in my stay at the Hotel Indigo the night previous  It made me feel less than welcome so the quotshwankquot was wasted on me  I did like the conveniences  Valet parking is   a night so ask about self park it is just around the corner under some shopping mall I cant for the life of me remember what it was called for   a night  It is valet too just not from right in front of the hotel  Great location if you want to do the shops on Mag Mile  Short bus or cab rid to other downtown sights like the Art Institute or King Tut Field Museum  I didnt have time to check out the resturants but there have to be so many really good ones nearby its Michigan Ave  There are sirens and other loud street noises as you might expect dowtown but I was able to sleep with earplugs  This would be a very nice place for a romantic weekend or a business trip  
P => Top notch choice I stayed at the Omni for a  day business trip  The hotel is well located immediately across from the Apple Store on N Michigan Ave  The room was a King bedroom and a small living room area with plasma TV  I thought it was a pretty good value at about  per night compared with the other recommended convention hotels which did not appear to be as nice and were more money  Room and service were really top notch   extremely clean very friendly staff and desk clerks  Minor annoyances included no ethernet port in room but there was high speed wifi connection no gift shop or news kiosk in hotel  I tried the  restaurant on the th floor several times and while service was great food quality was uneven  A peppered tuna entre was virtually inedible while a special pasta dish was wonderful  If I were going back to Chicago and wanted to stay on the Magnificent Mile I would definitely stay at the Omni again  I recommend a restaurant about five or six blocks west of the hotel on Huron called Allens   the new American Cafe which was very good and less expensive than the hotel restaurant  
P => Great Spot  All of the reviews are true and we loved our stay  You cant ask for a better location and the rooms are VERY spacious  Do yourself a favor and check out the breakfast   the hotel restaurant  
P => All you can ask for        Everything has been said about the location and the rooms etc  but I will tell you about the service we encountered  On arrival our mini bar seemed very warm and I called the desk  Within  minutes someone from engineering was up to inspect and told us due to the reations they didnt leave enough breathing room for some of the mini bars and this was causing problems which they are in the process of fixing   minutes later we had a small fridge in our room which they transferred everything toand gave us a free night to use use the mini bar stuff  Nice touch  That afternoon we asked the concierge for a steakhouse recommondation and he suggested and set up a resservation for Rosebud which was top notch  The guys outside the front door were very helpful with little tips here and there plus an umbrella for when it rained on us  We had a suite that was smaller than some others we saw but it was more than enough for   The plasma was of course was great  To me service is paramount and this place was was outstanding  
P => Good hotel We stayed at Omni for  days in ust  The hotel is very good  Service is above average altough the price is not cheap  Location is perfect for shopping and leisure and restaurants  The room was ok enough space  TV clean and the bathroom quite large and very well furnished  If back to Chicago I will stay again here  
P => Great Room The Omni Chicago Hotel is an all suites hotel and the room I stayed in was great  Large king bed which was very comfortable and a nice large bathroom  My room had a desk and a flat screen television  The staff was very friendly as well  
P => great location great staff great amenity In late  ive paid a visit to Chicago on business for one week  I have read some good things about this hotel so i thought i should try it out also it is listed in our approved corp travel list  i am quitee finicky when it comes to overnight accommodation so i also try to do ample research on hotels to ensure i have a good stay at a foreign city  Omni Chicago did not disappoint every room in this establishment is set up as a suite so you have a lot more space that most hotels offer for a standard room  the flat panel tv was a treat in the living area where there was also a work desk and sofa  The bathroom was immaculately clean bright and large  Their turndown service was especially sweet with individually wrapped chocolate and a color coded weather card indicating the next days weather and temperatue on the pillow which are indicative of their attention to details  My stay also included the following amenities no additional charge    wireless internet in the room    access to gym not big but adaquate for a quick workout as well as pool and jacuzzi   complimentary express breakfast allowing you to select from an limited menu offering choices of juice bagels and newspaper delivered to your room at time specified by you   transport to downtown chicago where my office locatesNot to mention perfect location right off of michigan avenue for shopping and good restaurant  I did not try their in house restaurant since there are so many other choices near by    but i cant imagine it being too bad  My old quotnot so perfectquot experience was that they mixed up my transporation reservation and about  hr before my scheduled time they called me and indicated that the car wasnt available for me as the person who made the resv for me has double booked  However the concierge was apologetic got me a cab instead and insistied on paying for the ride  Omni would be my choice next time again in Chicago 
P => Loved the Omni but watch out for the pool My husband and I travel to Chicago between   times a year  We have stayed at various hotels in our stays but we were very excited to stay at the Omni  The location looked great and we have heard nothing but rave reviews from friends and family that have stayed with the hotel in the past We arrived early and our room was ready  The Omni met our every request   high floor and early check in  That was fantastic Room   the room was more than what we imagined  We had read one review that warned travlers that it is much smaller than what is pictured  To us it was absolutely perfect  The room was large enough for  adults if needed and it was nice how the restroom area could be blocked off from the front living space and the bedroom  We booked a deluxe king suite Problems Let me say this the staff was over the top outstanding but we did encounter some areas of concern  First our toilet leaked  We did let the front desk know they told us someone would check it out  Second on our last day of our stay I made the mistake of walking the ac unit controls to adjust it and walked in only my socks  The entire floor near the controls was saturated with water  Since it was our last day the front desk said they would have someone look at it after we left  Third the housekeeping staff changed our sheets each night  On the second night of our visit there were large reddish stains on the fitted sheet  I assumed they were blood stains so we put a blanket down and we pulled the sheet off they were changed the next day but how gross is thatMain Problem   the pool area  It is very small and the pictures make it look larger than it is  Since we do travel a lot my husband and I enjoy soaking in a nice hot tub or going for a swim  We were only able to use the facility once the day before our departure  We sat in the small hot tub only fits  people at a time and then went for a swim  We each showered off after the swim because the chlorine was pretty stinky  The next morning I noticed small red bumps all over my chest area  We flew home and the bumps got worse  I went to our dor who told me it was phalicilitus sp which is a bacterial rash caused from the pools not being properly balanced with chemicals so the bacteria does not die  I was put on antibiotics and have a bunch of anti itch creams  I contacted the Omni and have been referred to the Director of Security  Not sure what he can do for me  Overall the trip was good the room was nice and the location was outstanding  I have learned my lesson about public pools thoughI would recommend staying at the Omni again infact we probably would stay there too we just wont be going in the pool 
P => Excellent Location This hotel is awesome  The location is excellent and the staff was very helpful  The concierge always pointed us in the right direction and they even have a hotel car that will take you to some of the local attractions  The rooms are spacious and clean  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Enjoyable stay My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago hotel over y th weekend  The hotel suite was great plenty of room to relax in both the living room and bedroom  The hotel is in a fantastic location and we were able to quickly access major tourist destinations easily from there  The room has a nice plasma tv with granite countertops in the bathroom and minibar  There are no soda machines and the mini bar prices are high so we walked  blocks north to the Walgreens and got drinks and snacks from there  There is an ice machine on every floor  We used the really nice fitness center which had good workout equipment  A new Ginos East Pizza had just opened only  blocks away and we very much enjoyed eating there  One thing that needs improving    the room safe is outdated and needs updating to the typical electronic room safes  Additionally several times we tried to speak to the concierge in person but she was always on the phone one time we were waiting right in front of her and she took a call that was on hold instead of speaking with us so we just walked away  All in all the hotel met our expectations and we would definitely return  
P => Beautiful I stayed at the Omni with a Band that what in town  The room was amazing  Just walking in the hotel was gorgeous  I have no complaints  Prompt Room service Friendly front desk  Many shops beautiful fountin  Just an all around great hotel in a great City  
P => Omni is spectacular My family of four just returned from a four night stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel  The service at this hotel is terrific  Everyone from the doorman to the concierge was friendly and professional  The suitesrooms are newly reated and are large and comfortable  We had maid service twice daily and they did a great job at anticipating our needs and keeping the room clean and organized  Everything we asked for was delivered promptly and courteously  As members of the Select Guest program we received complimentary beverages and a newspaper each morning and the kids got cookies and milk on our first night there  We did not eat at the hotel restaurant but did enjoy drinks in the beautiful lounge overlooking Michigan avenue  The location of this hotel is also an advantage as it is right in the middle of Michigan Ave  close to the John Hancock tower Water Tower Place Rush street and miles of fantastic shopping  Dont miss Garretts popcorn right around the corner for a delicious snack Chicago is a great city to visit and has much to be proud of including its quotworld classquot service and beautifully maintained gardens and parks  When you visit next Id highly recommend a stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel  
P => Beautiful We stayed for one night at the Omni in Chicago for my boyfriends birthday  I requested the quotRomance Packagequot which included a corner room on a very high floor  I cant remember which floor sorry  Upon arrival we were greeted by a beautiful room with a chilled bottle of champagne White Star   nice and the concierge had come through with our reservations at the Capital Grille and VIP passes to Le Passage  Our room was absolutely fabulous beautiful bathroom great amenities mini fridge and sitting area with two large chairs  The bed was very comfortable as well  There was a flat screen tv and a nice desk  if you go there to do work  which we certainly did notBreakfast was included in our package and it was delivered promptly the next morning  Food was okay considering it was room service  We had a late checkout that was again included in our package so we ided to go for a walk around the city  The hotel is perfectly located right on Magnificient Mile Michigan Avenue  If you want to go shopping or just see the sights it is perfect I regret staying only one night at this hotel I foolishly ided to book another hotel for my second night and wish I had just ponied up the money for the Omni  The package online at the Omni was  and worth every penny  I am a seasoned traveler both work and play and I enjoy staying at the finer hotels  This one certainly fit the bill  
P => Great Location Great Service Great Hotel This is a beautiful hotel in a terrific location  All of downtown Chicago is easily accesible from this hotel  They also have a town car with a driver who will take you wherever you want to go during the day  this is a great service and you should definitely take advantage of it  The only problem I had while staying there is that the fitness room was under reation and so they had moved the equipment into some extra rooms  So that was a drawback but Im sure the new gym that opens will be nice Also they could benefit from making the furniture in the sitting rooms more comfortable  But overall a great hotel  and they have deals during the off season so even the budget conscious can afford to stay at certain times during the year  
P => Great Hotel Excellent Location My sister and I ided to get away for the weekend and meet in Chicago  She had heard great things about the Omni so we ided to stay there in ember   The Omni Chicago is located right on Michigan avenue which was great because we could just walk ouside the hotel and immediately enjoy walking the Magnificent Mile  From the moment we pulled our rental car up the hotel the bell staff were extremely friendly and very helpful  Surprisingly they were the ones that demonstrated what customer service should be  When we got inside the hotel to check in we experienced the complete opposite  We patiently waited for someone to acknowledge us  No one else was standing in front of us  This lady behind the desk looked up at us didnt say a word then continued what she was doing  She could have said quotIll be right with you quot We didnt mind waiting but some sort of acknowledgement would have been nice  Finally she looks up puts out her hand as if to motion us to come and still doesnt say a word  Im surprised she didnt whistle and pet us once we approached the desk  No quotWelcomequot or quotHelloquot or anything She was downright rude and made us feel like we didnt deserve to be there  Were in our s are young professionals who were raised with excellent manners and came dressed nicely  not in anything inappropriate  I guess because we didnt look rich or established to her we didnt deserve any bit of service  After she checked us in she gave us our room keys and again didnt say a word  She never pointed out where the elevators were so we had to search for them That was the only bad experience  The room we had was very nice chic and modern with warm colors  The view is typical of a city view   lots of buildings  There was a large bedroom a sitting area with a desk and a moderate sized bathroom  The beds were very comfy  I really liked all the rooms except for the bathroom   it was dim and didnt seem to fit with the room because it wasnt that nice and looked like any other bathroom at a Holiday Inn  The restaurant is average  However the room service is excellent and the food delicious   definitely as if we were dining in an upscale restaurant  The desserts were also very good  In sumy its a great place to stay if you want to be close to all the shops and restaurants on Michigan Avenue  The bell desk staff should teach the front desk staff how to be professional and welcoming  They deserve the highest praise and made up for the rude front desk person  
P => Exceeded Every Expectation I traveled to Chicago on business this week but had an opportunity to bring along my wife and two young lt years old children  I chose the Omni for its location and quotsuitequot configuration Over the past  years I have stayed at every high end hotel in Chicago except The Peninsula  WIthout a doubt I have never stayed anywhere    Chicago or otherwise    where the staff was more energized about customer satisfaction  I was left to want for NOTHING during my stay whether it was needing an umbrella they have a zillion near the entrance doors or extra cookies for the turn down service  They even brought a high chair from the restaurant up to our room for us to use with my  month old for in room dining throughout our entire  night stay  The doorman helped my wife struggling with both kids and all their packages out of a taxi on a very rainy afternoon then read the driver the riot act for not getting out of his warm dry seat and helping them himself  Even the hotel operator was overly friendly and would follow up to see that the appropriate person got back to us to address our needs  This is a group of top flight professionals  They make the staffs at the FS amp RC look a little better than average and at half the cost The room was fine    plenty of room for the four of us with two queens in the BR and a sofa bed in the salon  The kids actually slept best when they slept on the floor on extra comforters and blankets cheerfully and quickly delivered by the HK staff instead of the provided crib and sofa bed  By the way friends got a room w a King and their salon had two chairs instead of the sofa bed  The Salon has a wet bar good desktop workspace and a big inch Panasonic plasma the one in our friends room had lots of problems but ours worked flawlessly  There is a smaller CRT TV in the bedroom  The bathrooms are above average size and the shower pumps out lots of hot steamy water with fabulous water pressure  Free wireless internet access w a very strong signal and fast connection speeds was a nice bonus and the savings usually day needs to be considered when comparing the Omni to other hotels  Free shoeshine service is another great perk and greatly appreciated when the nasty weather takes its toll on your dogs If I had to cite any negatives I would have to get really picky  I guess that I could whine that the room or looked a little dated but the materials and finishes were of very good quality  And the pocket door between the bathroom and BR rattled whenever you opened the door from the salon to the bathroom  It is easy to understand why Oprah outs her guests up here  Very good value for money The location can not be beat    at the corner of Michigan amp Huron    makes for an easy walk to great dining Water Tower the Lakefront Rush Street aka the Viagra Triangle and American Girl anyone who has a young dhter knows why it is important to be close to this Shrine of American Merchandising Excess I agree with previous suggestions about joining the Special Guest frequent visitor program gets you comp  beverage service and three newspapers every morning among other things and requesting a high floor but disagree that the two elevator route to your room is a negative  I paid lt a night and feel that the value far exceeded this price  Similarly the staff and really my entire stay exceeded all expectations  I would absolutely positively stay here again as would my incredibly picky and hard to please wife  
P => Great stay at the Omni Chicago I stayed at the Omni Chicago over Easter weekend and all I have to say is from the time I checked in to the time I checked out everything was easy and smooth  My bf and I knew we would be arriving in Chicago early morning and had called to see if early check in was possible and was informed that check in was at noon however they would be able to hold our luggages  Upon arriving early Friday morning am at the hotel we tried our luck with early check in and was very pleased to find that the room we reserved was available and we were able to check in right away  We were also upgraded to the executive suite on the th floor  th floor being the highest The suite was very nice you have your own wet bar dining table living room and two plasma tvs one in the living room and bedroom We had a corner suite with a ent view of the city and of Mag  mile  The Omni is great for their complimentary morning drinks and paper  The concierge was very helpful in recommending good dinerscafes for great morning breakfast  Dont miss the West Egg cafe for breakfast  The concierge also gave good directions to where we wanted to go  The hotel location is great in getting around to most of the museums and Grant park etc  It is just one or two buses away and you can catch the bus right on mag mile without waiting for more then mins top I recommend getting the CTA vistors pass its well worth it instead of taking a cab  It is also close to John Hancock and the Water Tower so walking is a good way of getting around as well  Many Chicagoans recommended us taking a walk along Lake Michigan and we did and thought it was really beautiful  So I would like to recommend anyone who hasnt to do so as well  We asked the concierge about boat tours of the city and we were recommened to Wendella boat tours  We opt for mins river and lake tour it was the highlight of our trip as we cht the last tour at pm and saw the city light up at dusk  We were also given free passes to a few barlounge by our concierge when we asked where were the nice night spots  The only cons I have to say about the hotel would be that the suite did not have a full length mirror anywhere in the room and the only mirror was in the bathroom  Also a couple of times we wanted to take a swim in the hotel pool but everytime we went it was crowded with people or kids and since the pool and hot tub is kind of on the small side it just seemed really cramped  So we werent able to take a dip All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Omni  We had a choice between the Sofitel or the Omni but choose the Omni because of a great price we were able to get and when we arrived we found that the Omni was still a better choice in terms of great location great customer service and superior room selection  We loved our trip to Chicago and would definitely stay at the Omni again  
P => A very nice hotel in a great location Our family just returned from a week in Chicago and a great stay at the Omni  My family of  had two suites on the th floor that we booked through PriceLine at  per room  Those rooms go for  and up  It was my first experience with Priceline and my first stay at the OmniMichigan Avenue  Its a great hotel  The employees were all very nice and very helpful  The rooms were big clean and had all we needed  The bathrooms were fine  Not the Ritz but clean and fine  The beds were very comfortable  The health club and pool had been recently refurbished and were very nice  The restaurant was also very nice but not cheap  A cup of coffee was   but the service was great  I cant understand the other reviews that were negative about this hotel  Its in a great location and I would def  stay here again with my family  
P => A good hotel for business travelers I have stayed twice at the Omni in the past year on business trips to Chicago  It is not the most glamorous hotel in Chicago but I have been satisfied nonetheless due to its large roomssuites and its helpful staff  On both visits to the Omni I have been given a suite with a bedroom and a living room which had a nice plasma TV  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice  My wakeup calls were delivered on time and with a friendly voice  The bar was a pleasure and the front desk staff was very friendly and courteous  I didnt try the health club which has drawn a few negative commens on this website  Also a work colleague of mine once got a room next to the elevators and had trouble getting a good nights sleep   insist on a room away from the elevators  Overall I am a fan of this hotel and plan to return  Its positives far outweigh its negatives  
P => Great Stay Great Price My partner and I live in Chicago bit ided to spurge for a birthday and stayed one nite here  We got a great rate thru Hotwire  dollars plus tax  The lobby was beautiful as well as our room  we got a nonsmoking King with a great view of Hancock building  THe room was spotless and well appointed and the bathroom huge  The location is in a quiet residential area but just two blocks off of all the hustle and bustle of Rush Street  A word to the wise avoid the overpriced Cape Cod room at the Drake  My food was okay but my partners was below average and the bill was  without tip and neither of us drink On Sunday nite my partner got deathly ill which we attributed to the food  On Monday we read in the paper that an entire group of people came down with norovirus that weekend a gastrointestinal illness  Well never go there again  For a great brunch however go the Signature Room on the th floor of the Hancock  Fabulous food pricey  a head but worth it  Make a reservation early to get a window table  
P => Great shopping location My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend at the end of uary  The rooms were very clean and cozy  Not quite as big as the pictures make them out to be but nice  The bed was extremely comfortable that I slept so well both nights and was suprised how quiet the rooms were despite being downtown  The pool was very small and the hot tub looked as though it could barely fit two people so we skipped the swimming  We had breakfast both mornings in the hotel restaurant which was kind of pricey but the food was pretty good  Both mornings we ended up with the same waiter who didnt seem as though he wanted to be there and wasnt very talkative but all other wait staff seemed friendly and helpful  The location of this hotel was convenient for shopping and dining with many many shops and restaurants within close walking distance  The front desk staff was also very friendly and accommodating  We had a pm flight home on Sunday and were able to get a pm check out without charge and then they held all of our bags and luggage for us until about pm  All in all it was a nice hotel  I would definitely stay again  
P => Beware of recreational facilities Please be aware that the health club is completely under reation and will not be completed for some months  Also the indoor pool is completely outdated and showing in its age  Do not stay at this hotel if the recreational facilities are important for you and or your family  The rooms however are very pleasant  The restaurant  is completely overpriced  You will receive much better food and services at the Grand Luxe Restaurant down the street  
P => Great location terrible health club I just stayed at the Omni Hotel on Michigan Avenue in Chicago  The hotel was fine but if you need a health club forget it  Its two converted hotel rooms crammed with equipment  I was very disappointed to say the least  
P => Great Girls Weekend Booked two suited for  girls for a shopping weekend at an amazing rate that included  per day in room service credits  Rooms are huge and the bedding is some of the most comfy I have ever slept in  and that includes the quotHeavenly Bedsquot they have at other chains as well as various Four Seasons  In fact I usually stay at the Four Seasons when in Chicago but I was planning a stay for several people and wanted to be more conscious of budget in order to accomodate everyone  Nice plasma screen TVs reasonably good bath products bath robes tasteful furniture and a really good flow to the room with more than enough room for  adults or a family to fit comfortably  The only cons I can mention are the walls ARE a bit thin as mentioned in other reviews  You can easily hear people talking in the hall and one night we were awoken at AM with the drunken giggling and screams of several girls  Annoying but I fell right back to sleep  Room service was prompt and the food very good  the fruit was fresh and included some of the biggest blackberries I have seen  Staff was always friendly and ready and willing to help  that being said I believe in tipping when someone provides you with a service housekeeping bell services concierge and it  be reflected in their attitude  Although everyone was very friendly even upon arrival at PM in a snowstorm  Check in a breeze  literally took  seconds  Cannot recommend the hotel membership enough  it includes free beverages in the morning and since I always start the day with a Diet Coke anyway it was a nice little extra  For the price I paid I could not have been happier  I  stay there in the future over any other hotel because I just felt as though I received so many value added services late PM check out free beverages lovely turn down etc  
P => Fabulous Spacious and Cozy Location  I take my  dhters downtown for a quotHoliday Getawayquotevery year  Have stayed everywhere from Four Seasons to the Ritz to the Drake  Last year we chose Omni Suites  WOW the rooms were spacious beautiful andmy girls flipped over the warm chocolate chip cookies and milk at quotturn downquot  It was special quotHoliday Ratequot that cost us very little  I would back there in a second and rate it WAY above the Ritz  NO comparison  You will be shocked at the size of these rooms  Cant wait to go back  
P => Loved the Omni Chicago I loved the Omni  Everything was clean and the rooms were large  The service was excellent beds were very comfortable and the location was perfect  Also be sure you sign up for the select guest membership  It is worth it 
P => Very pleased with the Omni First off despite its Michigan Avenue address the entrance to this hotel is on Huron and if you were driving along Michigan you just might miss it  There was one tiny sign on Michigan which I did notice but only because I was walking  Once inside the entrance you have to take an elevator to the rd floor check in area  Check in was easy   no mention of Hotwire whom I had booked through and the front desk clerk even attempted to find me an upgraded room as I had brought an upgrade certificate that I received when I joined Omnis Select Guest Program  Unfortunately they had all been assigned to members of a wedding party that were staying there  So I guess well save that certificate for another time and I do hope to stay there again  Since this hotel is an all suite property I wasnt too disappointed Initially I was assigned a suite with  double beds on the th floor my request as I was staying with a friend who was meeting me later  Unfortunately there was a problem with the pocket door from the bedroom into the bathroom  It was broken and stuck   could not be opened or closed  Privacy was going to be an issue so I called the front desk  They then assigned me a corner king suite on the th floor as no other doubles were available at the time   I was okay with the idea and the clerk assured my I would like the room better as it had more windows and better views  Oddly enough I didnt like it better  There wasnt much to look at out the windows facing south onto Michigan the views were obscured  And the extra window was behind the bed and it was very difficult to open the roman shade  To boot there was a VERY loud family staying in the room next door   as this was a quotgirls night outquot without our kids I really didnt want to deal with the noise  So I called down to the front desk again   they were very gracious and understanding and offered to get another double room serviced for me and told me to make myself at home in the king suite while I waited  About a half hour later they called to tell me my room on the th floor was ready   just in time for my friend to join me  This room was perfect   the bedroom had two doubles with luxurious bedding Triple sheeted with a down blanket and a down comforter  Bedrooms have a closet and plenty of drawer space as well as a TV and CD playerclockradio  They are arated from the sitting area by French doors  Our parlor had  lounge chairs which was just what we wanted the other suites I saw had sofa beds which Im sure works nicely for some guests  There is a nice wet bar area in this room but the fridge is stocked  Not an issue for us as we were drinking red wine and didnt need a fridge  And unlike some suite hotels these do not have microwave ovens  There is also a nice sized desk over by the window  The sitting room was quite large and could have easily accomodated more furniture  The furnishings and or were very modern   warm shades of green and burgundy and no loud floral patterns on the drapes or bedspreads  Another highlight of this property is the large plasma TV in the sitting room   it was probably wasted on two old friends who were too busy yakking to watch TV fyi the TVs in the bedrooms are NOT plasma  Finally the bathroom was fine   not spectacular but elegant with a ble floor and vanity top  The towels and robes were soft and fluffy  They had one of those rounded shower curtain rods which makes the bathtub feel a little more spacious  Water pressure in the shower was great and hot water plentiful  I didnt take any pictures of the room but the ones on Omnis website are very accurate  I really loved these rooms   and the hotel staff was wonderful and attentive  The location of this hotel is perfect for shopping and dining alike  Views are nothing to write home about if a great view is essential for you stay over on Wacker or in River North  We cabbed it to the Oriental Theatre to see Wicked   less than  including tip  It was a comfortable fall night so we walked back to the hotel from the theatre and it wasnt a bad trek  By virtue of my quotselect guestquot status we asked for and were granted a PM check out the next day which allowed us to wait until after lunch to pack our bags  The preferred status is also supposed to get you turn down service and a morning beverage   I didnt ask about either of these and I was perfectly content to make coffee in the room  While we were there we ordered spinach pizza and a salad from Giordanos about a block away on Rush Street   it was delivered in about a half hour for  including tip  Im sure this was a much cheaper option than room service although the prices looked pretty typical for a downtown Chicago hotel  We also didnt utilize the pool or hot tub we were avoiding kidsIf you ever ide to stay here do make sure to sign up for the Select Guest program a month or so ahead of time   its free and in addition to the free upgrade certificate they send you a half price room certificate good for weekend stay based on availability of course  The late check out was an awesome perk and they will allow you to stay as late as PM  All in all this was a great stay made even better because we paid only  on Hotwire less than half the normal room rate 
P => perfect location excellent staff staying in chicago is not cheap so the least you expect is ent service  the omni excels in this respect   everyone was effortlessly competent and friendly  yes the two stage lift is a bit of a nuisance but you dont wait long  location is great particularly if your partner is an Apple addict  comfy bed and hurrah plenty of storage in the bathroom   how often have you struggled to find somewhere to balance your washbag on the downside the fitness facilities arent up to much and the wi fi coverage was patchy  for classy cocktails before dinner try the bar at the Park Hyatt  
P => Not spectacular but nice little perks First of all I think the reations are complete so I did not have the problem of reating noises  Even though the hotel is quotall suitesquot I found it is no big deal as they are small suites  I can see how some people would find this not so attractive as each of the rooms are not that big     they are not tiny but nothing spectacular The rooms are nice orated with Flat screen TVs on the wall and I did not have the problems that previous people complained about the bed was great nothing wrong with the curtains and windows etc   Again the rooms are nice but nothing spectacular The other thing that I find annoying is the  sets of elevators  You need to take a set of elevators up to lobby level and then change elevators to get up to the room  I found that bothersome I know some of my friends find it quotsecurequot One thing I was very impressed about is their Omni Select program  I have never seen so many perks with a program   I would recommend joining it even if you are only going to stay there once  The best perks of that program are  Late checkout up to pm   free beverages of your choice in a glass in the morningYou also get free newspaper with that and exercise equipment in your room if you want but I dont see those as big deals     Location wise Omni is great considering that it is just off Michigan Ave near all the shops  The Cielo resturant does have ent food and if you sit at the window you do get a spectacular view of Michigan Ave     All in all I had a very pleasant stay but I can get better hotels at lower prices     
P => great location service and view Stayed at the Omni for  nights in e   After reading other reviews passed on the th floor corner room and instead took the regular room on the th floor  Room was nice and comfortable  Giant flat screen TV soft bed good servicejoin the omni hotel program and you get a newspaper and drinks every morning  Location is in the middle of North Michigan and about  blocks to the Red Line  I would have rated  stars but it was a little expensive to stay here  
P => Do Not Stay Here Whomever reated and designed this hotel obviously doesnt stay in a lot of hotels OK sized rooms but lots of negative wall space  The bathroom was spacious but with ONE HOOK on the wall  Are you kidding me The windows go about half way up the wall and the curtains are eye level when you are in bed so the morning sun comes BLARRING under the curtains and in your eyes as soon as the sun comes up BAD bad design  The doors are heavy and guestsstaff can be heard all day and night slamming doors The headboard of the uncomforatble beds is attached to the wall and all night long there was a clicking noise where I suppose the walls were expanding cant really figure it out  All night every night  I have not had a ent nights sleep for my entire  day stayOmni Chicago is terrible for business travelers Hardly any electrical outlets  The plugs to the lamps have some silly cloth thing to quotcover upquot the cords which look worse than the cords themselves  Is it safe to have cloth touching the plug and electrical outlet The Omni front desk also LOST a very important FedEx package I had to send to my client in San Francisco for next day delivery  Of course I didnt find out till the next day    And why on earth would ANY hotel put children on a business floorThis was my make or break trip with Omni Hotels  I have stayed at the Omni Boston several times and was disappointed then too  Very old hotel miniture rooms and VERY expensive According to my stay at Omni Chicago I WILL NEVER STAY AT ANOTHER OMNI HOTEL EVER AGAINNo one here takes any extra consideration to make sure you are having a pleasant stay  They kind of treat you like cattle  Get ya in and get ya out so they can occupy the next room  Absolutely no hospitality If you do have to stay here make sure your room doesnt face Michigan Ave  Sirens and motorcycles can be heard all nightPS I went to the Peninsula Hotel for spa treatments and that looked like a nice place    
P => Great location would stay here again Stayed here for  nights in e  The location on North Michigan Avenue is excellent  Within easy walking distance of shopping great restaurants the Red Line and sightseeing  The whole city is clean and pretty we just had a great experience  The rooms are very nice with a flat screen TV in the sitting room big comfortable king size bed and excellent maid service  Our room had a great view of Michigan Avenue although it could be a little noisy at night when emergency vehicles passed  Over all we had a great experience and I would definitely stay here again  
P => Reation Value Below Price I have used the Omni as my base of operations when attending Trade Shows in Chicago and over the last few years it has become apparent that a change is needed  Now during reation the noise is so loud you cant conduct business from the room during the day  The pool and hot tub are not available taxi to a local health club not near as convenient  There is no free wireless internet  Yet the prices are still some of the highest in the area during show dates  Poor value especially during the reation  No wonder shows are leaving Chicago costs and values are generally poor when compared nationally  
P => Wonderful hotel great bargain My wife and I recently took a leisure trip to Chicago and were fortunate enough to have booked a room at the Omni Chicago  We had stayed at this hotel three years ago with our children  The rooms have been completely refurbished with plasma screen tvs large ble bathrooms new carpeting upgraded amenities additonal storage space etc  This is the best hotel in Chicago for the money  We have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and Peninsua on prior occasions both of which were wonderful experiences  However the price of our room for three nights at the Omni was just slightly more than one night at the Ritz or Peninsula  Additionally the staff was efficient prompt knowledgeable and friendly  Room service was completed in a timely manner  The location is right on Michigan Avenue about a block from the Water Tower and is convenient to world class shopping and great restaurants  Our stay could not have been nicer  Join the Select Guest Program free for additional and complimentary amenities  
P => Great Location Just returned from a long weekend at the Omni Chicago  My husband and I have stayed here several times in the past  The location is unbeatable easy walking to all of the wonderful shopping and restaurants  The staff is friendly and helpful especially the bell staff  We stayed in a reated king suite  The new or is nice a little dull but nice  The new plasma TVs are great and all the rooms have them  The pillow top bed was great a much needed upgrade  The only thing bad I can say about the reations would be that it looked like they really rushed through them  The work looked a little quotshottyquot  We received turn down service each night and had wonderful chocolates waiting for us when we got back to the room  We had a GREAT breakfast buffet on Sunday in the restaurant at the Omni  Good service and the price was reasonable at  pp  Many breakfast buffets in chicago are well over pp  Overall would recommend the hotel for the location nice rooms and great staff  If you drive be prepared to pay   per day for parking which is the minimum going rate to park in Chicago One more tip For a great local place to go for breakfast try the Original Pancake House on Bellvue across from the Sutton Place hotel  About  blocks from the Omni towards the lake Good prices great french toast and baked apple pancakes It looks rundown but it is clean and worth it Get there by am to avoid a long wait Enjoy 
P => Great location but needs more than a litttle work The Omni has the name that helps it a lot   of course Oprah putting her guests here for years hasnt hurt  Be leary of the quotreationquot We stayed here beginning of il  and it was far from being over  They begin on the th floor and are working their way down  We were put on the th floor and work was obviously still being done  The conceirge is exceptional as is most of the staff  Long story shortbrown water from faucetquotundesirable and unwritablequot stains on bed sheets housekeeping came and took care of it immediatelyplumbing issues quotengineerquot said he would have to rip camode from wall to fix sewage problem from reation and it would be a mess   minor issue no tissues left in room lighting is too dullIf this sounds like youre type of place go for it Have fun 
P => Great service location This hotel has a perfect location on Michigan Ave  Also the staff was exceptionally friendly allowing early check in late check out and housekeeping even found and returned a an item lost in a common area  My only complaints were street noise including lots of ambulence sirens due to hospital  blocks away and semi hard beds  However even though we did not have a newly reated room it was still pleasant and spacious  I did hear that reations are progressing from the top down so ask for a room on the highest floor availible  
P => Awesome Stay This is a great hotel in a great location The staff was extraordinarily friendly and we had chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room each evening  The hotel is in an awesome location close to all the shopping and sights in downtown Chicago  The hotel is older but they announced plans to completely reate by    Highly recommended 
P => Oprah wouldnt stay here First off I must share that we got a fantastic rate for our room   night  tax   so I am satisfied with the quotvaluequot we received in our experience  However if Id paid full rack rate for the room I would have been disappointed PROS The staff was largely very friendly and accomodating  Jon the doorman was helpful with suggestions for dinner and clubs  He really acted as our personal concierge  The bell staff were also friendly and outgoing  We really felt remembered and recognized  Also the location is very handy  Finally the size of the suite was nice and the layout worked pretty well CONS The common spaces and room were very rough around the edges   clearly in need of reation  The carpet was worn the walls were dinged up   ours even had a small hole in it  The pocket door erating the bathroombedroom came off the hinges every time we tried to use it  Our bathroom sink spit out bright yellow water at first  The sheets were on the rough side and the or was a little tacky  We also had a non functioning light above our wet bar and called down to ask that it be fixed  The individual I spoke with told me it wasnt possible due to a wiring problem  She offered to allow us to change rooms but we were all unpacked and chose to stay put  The next day my friend called down again about the light unaware that Id called already  Housekeeping came right up and replaced the light bulb and the light worked just fine  
P => The Omni is awesome Stayed here over a the    weekend  The staff were extremely helpful and courteous and the roomsuite was very nice with king bed and pull out couch  Got a great rate night and free full not Continental breakfast for two mornings  The location is awesome  I will definitely stay there again when I come to Chicago  
P => Wonderful room great bargain We stayed in Chicago for  nights in y   We found the hotel staff to be friendly and efficient the room suite really luxurious and in good condition and it was in a great location along the Mag Mile  We also got a GREAT rate with a free continental breakfast every morning delivered to us by room service You can also get extra perks by joining their loyalty program before booking your room  
P => Above Average The good location is excellent  Right off Michigan Ave  near the heart of the City  Taxi ride to most places you might want to go less than   The room layout was clever  We booked a corner suite which was spacious enough to hang out in the room for a prolonged period of time without getting claustrophobic  The not so good traffic noise even with windows closed was significant  There must be a hospital nearby as there were a number of ambulances with sirens blaring at all hours of the day  The room was comfortable to be sure but for almost  per night it seemed excessive particularly when little things like no turndown service the first night tea ordered through room service delivered with no cream the turndown service the second night had no cart placed outside of the door so when we entered the room the attendant turning down the room scared the heck out of us  And this has nothing to do with anything but there is no grand lobby per se  you enter the hotel at street level and are confronted by the bell stand and a bank of elevators  Once inside you take the elevator to the rd floor and the lobby which by luxury hotel standards is much less than you would expect  We would stay there again but we would certainly only do so with a significantly lower room rate  
P => Glorious weather   so so hotel tember      were glorious days perfect weather  Unfortunately the Omni is showing its age and lack of attention to detail We have stayed here several times over the span of  years and have witnessed the slow line  Our commode was dirty but was promptly cleaned upon our request  The bathroom showed sings of mildew  The room carpet was stained and the book shelves were dirty However our rate was excellent and the location is hard to beat  I did consider both the Rtiz and Four Seasons but their rates were   higher One receives what one pays for  
P => Great place to stay My husband and I stayed at the Omni for our honeymoon t      The staff was very friendly and extra helpful  The hotel was in an excellent location and well accomodated  The rooms were really nicely furnished spacious which is hard to find in Chicago and had excellent views of Michigan Ave  the John Hancock Bldg  and beyond if you stay high up which I would recommend  The only thing I didnt like was that the tvs there were two in our room were small  They were only quot   very small complaint in consideration  When we arrived we told them it was our honeymoon  We left for dinner and when we returned there was a bottle of champagne choc  covered strawberries and truffles waiting for us  It was a really nice touch I would definately stay again and would recommend anyone else to stay there as well One thing I would tell guests to beware of the bottled water in the Honor Bar is   per  liter bottle  No joke So bring your own bc Chicagos water is nasty Cheers 
P => Weekend Getaway at the Omni My mother in law sister in law and husbands aunt and I all flew to Chicago in il for a shopping weekend getaway and stayed in the Omni  We had the best time that weekend and I can say staying at the Omni just added to the relaxing wonderful weekend  Its so clean beautiful and conveniently located to where you have access to the malls shopping resteraunts etc  I loved Chicago and LOVED the Omni  I hope to stay there again this time with my husband 
P => Oprahs Guests SHOULD Stay Here Three friends and I stayed at the Omni on ust   when we flew to Chicago to go the Oprah Winfrey Show  Everyone wanted to stay in this hotel because Oprahs guests stay there  I was a little concerned about some of the negative reviews but this is actually a WONDERFUL place to stay   especially for shopping on North Michigan Avenue Great views of Chicago and a perfect location The suite is very nice  The or is much better than at many hotels   wingback chairs bookcases with real books  The bathroom is larger than average with a hair dryer and plenty of shampoos soap lotions etc  There is an expensive but well stocked basket of goodies we didnt eat any  We realized in the morning that we didnt have a coffee maker and one was brought up as soon as we requested it  The people at the front desk were pleasant  The beds are comfortable and there is an iron and ironing board in the closet  You DO have to take two elevators but that really isnt such a big deal  You have to enter the suite through a short hallway that seems to be wasted space but there was virtually no noise ever in our suite  We did not try the restaurant or room service so cant vouch for the food  There are TONS of fabulous places to eat in Chicago including a Starbucks right around the corner for breakfast so I wouldnt have wanted to eat at the hotel anyway  We had a AAA rate of about  per night which I thought was a very good value for the large suite  I DEFINITELY would stay there again  We have been in Chicago many times before and there just isnt a better location than the Omni 
P => Great location and service Omni Chicago is at the heart Chicago s tourist area It is close to everything The hotel is at a walking distance from Navy Pier and John Hancock Building and just a few blocks from the water front  It is at the heart of the Magnificent Mile for those interested in shopping  Lots of great restaurants around  The staff and management service was great The room was spacious and neatly clean  I would definitely would stay there again  
P => A travelers warning I want to issue a travel warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time The deal says quotfree breakfastquot included in the price  However what they dont tell you is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit or two Moreover you need to ask for these quotticketsquot at the lobby when you check in   they wont give them to you automaticallyWe stayed there over Christmas  and we and I noticed several guests who bought the same package had a rather unpleasant experience The hotel is nice though if you dont consider their lousy service 
P => Great Stay at Omni Chicago Stayed from e    Very clean and quiet  Good room service  Attentive staff  Great location  Very nice stay 
P => OK room great service My wife and I recently stayed at the Omni over the weekend on Michigan Ave  and Id have to say that I was little underwhelmed by the room  It was on the small side for a suite and definitely wasnt as nice as the Westin we stayed at the last time we were in the city  I was surprised to see that the carpet had stains and was tearing and the bathroom looked like it hadnt been updated in quite some time  I will have to say the the staff is very friendly and helpful but I think you can get nicer rooms for this price range   
P => not bad My wife and I stay at hotles in the city occasionally  The Omni where guests of the Ophra Winfrey show stay is pretty nice  ent suite sized rooms but the TVs are way too small  Great location and views of Michigan avenue  Room service was pretty good too  We got the room in the middle of the week for  via hotels com  I thought it was a good deal  
P => Omni Chicago NEVER AGAIN  
P => Omni on Michigan is a Dream

P => 
P => Confirm email access before booking room Our company had  rooms for  nights  They had no internet access at all  When the guys approached the front desk they were told they would restart the server  This happened for  days and did not correct the problem  I called the front desk and spoke to the manager Tatiana she was extremely rude and even lhed when I told her that NONE of the guys could access the internet  FINALLY the GM Larry Knottingham called me and was very polite and helpful however assured me the problem had been corrected and the guys still cannot access the internet   of our guys had to have their cards reactived as they would not work  WILL NOT BE STAYING THERE FOR OUR NEXT MEETING  
P => This Hotel Sucks They wrongly charged my credit card and were not helpful in the process of refunding it  The manager name Tiana is so arrogant when I demanded that she refund my cradit card  Also during the stay I asked for an extra towel and the only thing she can say was quotjust wait for the cleaning lady to drop by quot WHAT DONT STAY IN THIS HOTEL  The staff might look nice upfront but they suck and arrogant 
P => Great for road trippin The hotel is an excellent choice for those who are interested in spending a few nights in a clean room to rest and regroup  I am very surprised with the staff at the front desk they did an excellent job checking me in and answering questions about the room and the surrounding area  I would stay here again if I was in the area  
P => A Diamond in the Rough This has to be the friendliest staff I have ever seen  Rooms have a clean crisp look to them  Staff is on top of all the details  I travel a lot and look forward to future stays with a hotel that really cares about its customers 
P => OK value Stayed at the hotel in e   Room was clean and nicely furnished  Unfortunately my room faced Milwaukee Avenue and received a lot of traffic noise  This surprised me since I had asked for a quiet room  I used the AC to help drown out the noise  There is a nice forest preserve right across the street  The breakfast was not hot as advertised but otherwise adequate  Staff was not accommodating and would not let me check out past noon despite the hotel being almost empty  The staff also gave me conflicting information about breakfast times etc  which might be because of the recent change in ownership  Overall it was a good value at a discounted price  
P => 
P => GREAT FIVE STAR I have become a huge fan of Park Hyatt Hotels since my last few great stays with them  Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental dont have loyalty programs so when I go on business trips Im motivated by getting the points  Something about getting a free night stay with two or something got me to check out the Park Hyatts  And Im glad I did This hotel has a spectacular modern lobby  Fantastic spa  We had a great view from our room see picture  The tub was super deep and they gave really great eucalyptus salts that were awesome after a long day of meetings  The room service menu had a great selection of sushi  Breakfast on the th floor was really nice with a great view Criticism the wifi at our room  was non existent  I dont know why  And also   be VERY specific on getting directions to the entrance the building is the huge water tower place and if you go to the GPS ked location youll for sure be lost  Ask concierge on your way in specifically how to find the entrance we circled around for about half an hour  Other than that its great  You have a semi great room experience with the master bath opening into the living room  We loved it  Oh   sheets couldve been softer  
P => My Favorite Michigan Ave Hotel Michigan Ave is graced with at least four of the best city hotels in the world  Ive stayed in them all many times  I cant say a negative thing about any one of them  They all are  star and its a matter on personal taste  I first stayed at the Park Hyatt over  years ago when it first open in its new incarnation  We stayed in the Pritzker Suite since renamed and were overwhelmed  Were appreciate art and organic objects  We tend to like mid century modern or  The Pritzker Suite was jaw dropping  For us it was the best Presidential type suite we had stayed in or even seen a picture of  I knew I had been spoilt and resisted booking the Park Hyatt because I would be disappointed knowing the heavenly suite was perched on the th floor  The  Seasons amp Ritz by  Seasons are great properties but after the Peninsula opened it become my home once a month for several years  After the economic downturn I became more sensitive to room rates and went back to Park Hyatt  Well I can report that its a  star product the equal of its next door neighbor and at a much sweeter value  The lack none of the high end amenities of a great hotel  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful  Cristophe alway greets me warmly by name and when I tell the bell men I dont need a car that Im taking the train a half block away to the airport I get a big thumbs up for being so st  Ive stayed in all the smaller suites and the standard rooms  All are great for a one or two day business trip  I think the    rooms all offer a great view of the Water Tower and on the higher floors an unobstructed view of Lake Michigan  NoMi is one of the better dining experiences in a city with some of the best chefs in the world  I love Park Hyatts and this one shines like a jewel  
P => On a scale of   this hotel and staff is   A repeat stay can often be disappointing in a hotel   not with the Park Hyatt  Every single detail is thought out to please the guest  It is absolutely the BEST example of running an excellent hotel   worth every penny spent  
P => Great Views Fantastic Location This was our second visit to the Park Hyatt  This was also the second time we did not get our promised upgrade  We see a pattern     The view of the Lake very nice  The Magnificent Mile location   FANTASTIC For a chain hotel they have done a great job with plush beds and luxurious linens  
P => chain hotels dont get much better than this The only reason that I didnt clock quotservicequot  was that a simple tea order took  minutes for room service to deliver and the only reason quotvaluequot didnt get a  is that youll always find slightly better value at an independent than a chain hotel as they have to work harder to find customers  Otherwise I could only find fault here by being REALLY picky Location is as good as it gets just far enough off the shopping strip to be civilized close enough to have cachet  Service was good a little too formal but it was the first time Ive stayed so I guess the staff erred on the side of caution  Great room nice size good stereo a big plus given that my favourite music store in the world is in Chicago and I always gluttonise CDs huge bathtub with a jar of bathsalts extra points ridiculously comfortable bed    But no teacoffee making which was a shame tho I guess at this price point the cost of a room service coffee is immaterial I used the pool   a proper half Olympic lap pool in a very good spagym complex  Full ks  And the reception staff knew the length too so I could calculate my sets properly  I ate in the Japanese esque restaurant and while the sushi was only moderately authentic there were some items you wouldnt find in Tokyo tho you probably would in LA it was excellent  Although the restaurant was clearly a power dining venue they accommodated a solo diner and his trashy el with aplomb The design of the place is very good quality without being glitzy and the staff are trained to the Nth degree almost up to Swiss or Hong Kong   standard  If you have the money and are prepared to spend it this hotel wont disappoint  
P => Loved the room We had our company meetings at the Park Hyatt so we booked rooms at the hotel  I thought that our room was amazing  The bathroom is still one of my all time favorites as is the view of the city  Additionally we ate at NOMI and it was a wonderful experience  The portions are small but the taste is very abundant  
P => Fantastic hotel in central location with loads of character The Park Hyatt is an absolutely fantastic hotel  I booked there not quite knowing what to expect   ie standard cookie cutter rooms and mediocre service   but this was far from what we found It is an art o building located on the miracle mile right next to John Hancock tower  It has been fully refurbed and the rooms are terrific with all the mod cons but with a great art o theme and stacks of character We booked into a deluxe room which was enormous with incredibly large bathroom  It had a bay window seat which was lovely and a great view over the city The bed was the comfiest I have ever experienced  We actually booked on our return to Chicago because we were so impressed with everything this hotel had to offer Staff were super friendly and willing to help you find anything you needed  There is also a town car for guests use with a fantastically friendly driver There is coffeetea and lemonade in the library for guests enjoyment during the dayevening  Free internet service etc  etc  Tiffanys Saks Ralph Lauren and all the big stores are literally on the front doorstep  I will stay at this hotel without hesitation when we return to Chicago which is a fantastic city  I have already recommended it to a friend who is going there  
P => Amazing hotel in a wonderful location in a great city My wife and I recently had the pleasure of spending seven days at the Park Hyatt Chicago  Located adjacent to Water Tower Place the Park Hyatt is perfectly situated on Michigan Avenue and convenient to many of the citys hot spots  My hotel reservation was made through American Express so we received several great bonuses including continental breakfast pm checkout  dining credit and every third night free  This is an outstanding deal for the hotel and I highly recommend anyone considering this hotel to take advantage of this offer The room we were given was on the th floor and had a great view of the city  The room itself was lovely and well outfitted  The bed was incredibly comfortable with a feather duvet pillows and mattress cover  Although the becoming standard flat screen television was missing the inclusion of a DVD player more than made up for it  Sliding panels between the bedroom and luxurious bath allowed the opening of the two rooms for extra ambiance especially if using the beautiful soaking tub  The true jewel  be the supremely powerful and hot walk in shower along with the incredible bath products  The doors are also very heavy and make for excellent noise blockers despite being close to the elevator I was never aware of any noise from the hallway The staff of the hotel was wonderful from the very first moment  As a sidebar member of the group U were staying at the hotel during the same time and the staff did an outstanding job managing the crowds and the extra level of excitement around the hotel  They never let the other activities interfere with them serving other guests We had the opportunity to use the excellent gym steam sauna and pool facilities all of which were spotless and well maintained  The staff was always attentive and helpful while we were in the facilities  We also took advantage of the hotels dining options  Each morning we enjoyed the Park breakfast basically a continental breakfast option in the lovely NoMI Restaurant  During the evening there are two basic optionsmenus quotindoor NoMIquot features several ultra fancy selections including superior sushi quotoutdoor NoMIquot features a delicious menu of sandwiches Kobi burger anyone and sushi to enjoy while looking over the city  
P => Simply the best I grew up around the Chicago area and traveled to the city often for work or play  I often admired the Park Hyatt from the outside but never considered staying there  Recently I was traveling home after a cross country drive and my girlfriend and I ided to stay here  Ill never stay elsewhere when I go backThe staff was amazing  Karen the Chef Concierge went out of her way to make suggestions for things to see places to eat and tours to take  She made reservations at a local Italian restaurant for us that was top notch  They treated us like royalty from the moment we entered at both the hotel and the restaurant  The hotel car was a nice touch in making for a special night Our room was a corner room on the th floor  It was immense with a wonderfully comfortable king bed  It had everything needed for a comfortable stay from a large bath and erate shower to a modern television and sound system  The location cannot be beat  Centrally located its walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and Grant park  Restaurants all around make for a foodies dream location  Ill definitely be back soon 
P => Right in the middle of everything We stayed at this lovely hotel for  nights  The room is amazing with up to date furniture clean and comfortable  We opted for the view of the lake from our window and I felt it was worth every penny looking at it from the padded window seat  Food We ate at Nomi at the hotel and although it was very pricey  people for   not including alcohol and one eating only a starter  It was beautifully presented and was prepared perfectly  The view itself explains the pricing Best location location location walk to all the little shops and the mall is literally across the street   minute ride to the bank of america theater and  minute taxi to the science museum worst The sirens at night  I could hear the ambulance sirens at least  or  times at night  I recommend bringing ear plugs if you are not a completely sound sleeper Amusing The bath in our room opened up with a slide door to the main hotel room  This could be very amazing especially if you opted for the lake view room at night  But not so good with a teenage dhter in the room  lol  We actually just closed it as tight as we could and hung the complimentary robe on top of the middle of the split side since you could see through the slit  
P => Nice Hotel with a Great View The Park Hyatt is definitely a st class hotel  I was in room  and had nice view of the Water Tower and Lake  The room itself was spacious and well appointed  It included free internet which it should  Rate I had was  plus parking  more ROOMGreat bed flat screen TV nice desk and little sitting area next to window  Really nice compared to the Drake where I have stayed in the past  Bathroom is awesome with a great bathtub and arate shower area  Double sink with nice amenities LOCATIONOn Michigan avenue with easy access to shopping and there is a Walgreens across the street  Many places to eat nearby and the hotel resturant NoMi is fantastic GYMHotel gym is nice with lots of equipement steam room and locker room Overall Id recommend the Park Hyatt  Really nice stay only wish I couldve stayed longer  
P => Great location and nice hotel but loud sirens were annoying at night  Very professional staff and security was very good  They did not speak unless you spoke to them  Pet fiendly for a fee  Good shopping and great resturant and cocktails  Can walk everywhere  Hotel starting to show wear carpet furniture etc    For night I really expect more  No club floor or food for Hyatt members  You can save night on parking by going across the street  Park and walk 
P => Loved it So beautiful great location super friendly gorgeous hotel 
P => Pretty Fabulous Stayed for one night at the Park Hyatt Chicago and more or less everything about it is excellent  The location on North Michigan is fine if a little could be anywhere mainstreet ville with the usual run of NordstromDisney StoreFerragamo boutique department and mega chain store shops that are on expensive streets the world over  But the hotel is nice for being tucked around a quieter corner and the location is good   nearby there are some fine and cheaper dining restaurants and for our  hour visit everything was accessible   for the cab journeys we took nothing was further than a fifteen minute ride  Doing the minor not so goods first    the parking is an extraordinary  whereas around the corner its  for  hours   so use that instead the hotel forgot both of our morning newspapers and thats about it for problems The room was lovely  An upholstered bench seat by the window contributed to the comfortable and homely feel  Theres fabric everywhere to give a soft quiet acoustic to the room and its a real mix of masculine and feminine elswhere  For the boys theres the classic  Charles Eames lounge chair with ottoman and a quietly ugly glass desk table  Theres also a ent TV and stereo system  For the girls the bathroom is rich dark wood luxurious wallpaper and scales The bed was perfect the linen was heavy complimentary apples and water were also offered The th floor health club was fantastic  Mrs Pippsyo joked that it was better equipped than her regular gym everything is new theres plenty of all the machines  theres plenty of the softer stuff too   mats and balls and so on  The m indoor lap pool was heated to  degrees and was a real pleaure as it was empty  The lady looking after the place was kind and helpful We didnt eat there but the hotel has a couple of nice lounge areas to hang out  The large room has the most extraordinary collection of fossils in a couple of big glass cabinets  And there are some really nice touches  Whenever you head towards a door   the exterior door or a lift door   its always ready  The staff have a remote controlled thing to get the doors ready for you  Its obviously unecessary but really fun  The concierge was helpful the internet worked fine  The hotel was wonderful and no doubt influenced us   wed really love to return to Chicago and to the Hyatt  
P => Modern Luxury I love this hotel From the mod stationary to the fabulous location this hotel is sophisticated without being stuffy  Quality furnishings in the room wonderful staff and good amenities like candles scented salts and matches placed by the side of the large jacuzzi tub  Ive stayed here about  times now and each of the stays have been good  If youre a Hyatt Gold Passport member this is THE place to use your FFN or stays  
P => Wonderful Stay I stayed at Park Hyatt for one free night and it was the most wonderful stay In the past year I have stayed at so many different hotel chains and I must admit this was by far the best  One would expect that because the room was free you would not receive such good service but not at Park Hyatt the staff was great  This includes a young lady coming to our door asking if we needed any ice Never has that happened  The restaurantbar offers great service and light fare if that is what you need  Hilton you have some work to do Oh let me not forget I asked for a late check out fully expecting I would pay a fee but was told quotno problemquot and no fee 
P => Great Location Good Room Poor Service We chose the PH for its reputation location and prior experience with the chain for a family weekend stay Check in was quick and we were in the rooms fairly quickly  The room sizes were large and we had a beautiful view of the Water Tower  Our complaint was with the service  We have always found the Concierge service at PH and other top tier hotels to be one of the key ingredients for a successful vacation  We were disappointed repeatedly in this case  We felt that the knowledge and suggestions of concierges were either poorly informed or just plain bad  This was in reference to restaurants and sightseeing Also when calling for any sort of help wake up call room service etc the phone often rang several times with no answer  We can accept these sorts of things at lower rated or cheaper hotels but for the money this was just plain disappointing  
P => Once again   outstanding  My third stay at this property and definitely not my last  Computer glitch in booking process was honored via phone confirmation prior to my arrival  Upon arrival they did not have any availability for the type of room stated on my pre printed confirmation so they upgraded me   to their absolutely amazing and gorgeous Lake Suite in all of its  square feet glory  When I walked into the room I was speechless  The upgrade aside the staff and service are always unmatched here  The views are stunning especially those facing east the property and furnishings beautifully understated without feeling too minimalist  Most likely will be the best stay in any hotel ever for me  Thank you to the staff at the Park Hyatt for an even more memorable time than my last stay 
P => Loved the Hotel and location Location amenities and service were all just excellent I stay here again and again  
P => Sensational hotel    Perhaps the best location in Chicago  Elegant tasteful warm and friendly staff  The hotel blends warm wood tones with ultra contemporary and succeeds  The bathroom was luxurious as was the rest of the room  It had been many years since I stayed at this hotel will always now make it my first choice to check when returning to Chicago  
P => Outstanding Location and GREAT Value We stayed at the Park Hyatt for Valentines weekend and were very impressed  We usually stay at the Westin but found the price at Park Hyatt was very reasonable  Infact the only thing the Westin had left we booked on ruary th was a room with two double beds for roughly the same price  This surprised us as we had tried to stay at the Park Hyatt several times and couldnt book anything under night  The room was wonderful overlooking the old Water Tower on the th floor  There is an enormous soaking tub and arate shower  The hotel is very quiet and the service was impressive  The dining room is spectacular NoMi but be prepared to pay dearly  Our dinner cost more than our room for one night Yikes But it was worth it  The concierge managed to find us an open table at Zealous the next night Valentines Day  which is a great local restaurant  My husband liked the fitness center and theres free internet access stations off the lobby  We would definitely go back again  
P => Great Hotel This is a very nice hotel with great service  I stayed here with my family for a weekend getaway  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful  They were very customer service oriented  We had a room with a view of the Water Tower and Lake Michigan  Terrific view  The room was clean and comfortable  The bathroom was large and the arate walk in shower was a nice feature The gymworkout room was as good as any Ive seen in a hotel  It also included free weights which I rarely encounter in hotels  The pool was large and kept at a comfortable temperature  The steam room was also nice The location of the hotel cant be beat  It is at the far north end of Michigan Ave  close to Water Tower  It is convenient to shopping and lots of great restaurants Finally my family loved the hot chocolate in the lobby on a cold uary day  A nice touch I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again  
P => Serenity in a Bustling City We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt Chicago and would certainly return again in fact we are in late uary  Although the room was not huge the furnishings were top notch the bed was amazing and the bathroom was large and luxurious with a jumbo bathtub arated from the bedroom by a sliding door arate shower and spacious double vanity with granite countertops  One nice touch was a bowl of apples placed in the room upon arrival all were eaten and free bottles of water during turndown  Great for a romantic getaway our purpose but were certain a business person would be equally satisfied  The lobby and public spaces provided an oasis from the busy Michigan Avenue just outside the door  Great location 
P => Best in Chicago The Park Hyatt Chicago is the best in Chicago  We have stayed at twice at this property and prefer it over the Peninsula  It has a very modern intimate feel  The location is perfect just off Michigan Avenue and be sure to get a room with a view of Water Tower and the Lake  The staff is great and the restaurant is superb  Having booked through the American Express Fine Hotels Resorts program the included amenities are fantastic  Room We stayed in a Park View King  The room was modern and has a great window seat overlooking Water Tower Michigan Avenue and the Lake in the distance  Rooms are nicely furnished and very relaxing  Restaurant Food is great including breakfast and dinner  The Nomi Lounge is also perfect for a smaller meal and excellent wine  The service at the outdoor terrace restaurant when open is a bit slow and not up to par with the inside restaurant and lounge We will always plan to stay at this great property every time we are in Chicago  
P => One of the very best in Chicago The Park Hyatt was a delightful experience and one of the best hotel stays we have had in Chicago in the past  years The location just off Watertower Park is perfect for a shopper or for a romantic getaway Excellent security at this hotel was illustrated by the staff when I was asked quotwould you liked to be escorted to your roomquot as I returned to the hotel alone in the evening after a hot chcolate run to Girradellis down the blockThis hotel gets A for their friendly staff at the front door the front desk and housekeepingAn imaculate spacious beautifully orated room with ammenities that surprised me a bowl of fresh glowing apples scented candles next to the soaking tub thick fluffy towels plush bathrobes a COMPLIMENTARY bottle of water on each night stand and free internet WIFILittle things like a shoe polishing machine in the closet a good quality iron and board an extensive selection of television channels including foreign language stations and a wonderful peaceful sense throughout the property I am adding photos to illustrate my rave review and I hope we have a chance to return soon  
P => Great Stay Downtown This was my second experience in a Park Hyatt and it was well worth it  The staff were so professional and the rooms were exquisitely orated  The location is superb   right on Michigan Avenue near the Magnificent Mile  Definitely would recommend this hotel 
P => Highly Recommended I have stayed in Hyatts across the US and Europe  I have generally found the Park Hyatts to be the best of the chain  This Hotel lives up to that expectation  Centrally located near the water Tower off Michigan Ave it comes with a very high standard of service  The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable although I would guess they are coming towards the end of their life cycle  However they are far from shabby and have many nice touches like candles in the bathroom and abundance of toiletries dvd player etc Downside is that it is expensive but what you expect considering its location and standard of service  
P => Great Location We stayed at the Park Hyatt in ust for nights  It was my second time in Chicago so I knew where the Hotel was located  Its right accross the street from the Watertower mall and the Hancock Tower and only about min walk from the lake The Hotel itself is lovely and the staff friendly  It has a very serene feel to it and you hardly see another guest  even waiting for the lift We didnt eat or drink in the Hotel so cant comment on that  There are so many great restuarants located close by We had a room on the th floor which was a corner room so lots of light from all the windows  The bathroom was huge  as big as some rooms Ive stayed in  It had a huge walk in shower and a large bath big enough for  with  large windows also a small tv on the wall which you could see from the bath Overall we both really enjoyed our stay here and would definately stay again if it is within budget as it can be quite pricey 
P => Couldnt have been any better I stayed at the Park Hyatt for one night about two weeks ago  From the moment I arrived I was struck by the attention to detail and customer service  For example the woman behind the desk walked me to the elevator after having handed me my key  As I left the desk clerk offered to print my airline boarding pass  The room itself was beautiful with complimentary water and fruit available  A mini bar contained other beverages and gorgeous robes were hung in the closet  The hotel was very quiet though there is traffic noise due only to the location I called the concierge with a question about getting to the airport and they could not have been more helpful Id recommend this hotel without hesitation  
P => Will select the Park Hyatt Chicago again Wanted to extend a business trip and did not want to stay at the convention hotel  So I choose the Park Hyatt This property has an excellant location   and the staff   were there to assist you   from the bell men to the Front Desk to the housekeeping staff  Room rates are on the high side    but if you want Chicagos best stay at the Chicago Park Hyatt  
P => Horrible Service all talk no action  ROOMS NEED REATION I will never stay at this hotel again  It was a perfect stay until they kept charging my credit card over and over again for my stay  With in two days after my departure this hyatt charge my credit card  times for one bill  I am still waiting for a refund  As a hyatt gold passport diamond member I would expect better service  ADVOID THIS HOTEL 
P => Surprisingly Good I was on a trip to Chicago to visit family and friends when I ided that staying out in the suburbs with the folks just wasnt going to cut it  So I called my travel agent during the drive to the city and we had a room booked in no time  About  minutes after I got off the phone with my travel agent yes I had a handsfree unit on I pulled up to the hotel The chic and contemporary interior isnt really my style but its exactly what I expected  What wasnt expected was the high level of customer service  As I walked up to the front desk I mentioned to the lady checking me in that I had just made the reservation  She responded by saying quotMr  X weve been expecting youquot real names have been replaced to protect the innocent The staff member was very courteous and quite helpful The room was nice and very comfortable however not in the style of my preference too contemporary for me  The soaking tub is GREAT  Other than the choice of or I really enjoyed the room  I just wish it were brighter and had more natural light The best part of my stay were my encounters with security and the door men  They are so nice I was only there for  nights and yet they knew my name I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for a week and no one there bothered to remember my name And it wasnt just that they remembered my name    while staying in the hotel I would wake up early and head back to my folks house in the suburbs  Now remember I only stayed at the Park Hyatt for  nights  The first morning I left for my parents I had brought the complimentary newspaper left on my door and a cup of coffee down with me for the drive  The next morning i was a bit disappointed that there was no paper on my door but I chalked it up to me being up so early  So I went down to grab the car and head out to my parents  While I was waiting for my car to be pulled around one of the doormen offered me a cup of coffee and to my surprise the aforementioned missing paper was on the passenger seat of my car  It was a great touch and the reason Ill probably be picking the Park Hyatt over the Peninsula Chicago whenever Im in town  
P => Very nice hotel but a few small problems Our family two girls  and  went on a quick trip to Chicago and spent one night at the Park Hyatt  I booked a Park View room with the AAA discount which includes breakfast  There are plenty of workers to help you as you pull up and get your luggage  They ask your name and escort you to the front desk where they tell that worker who you are   I was thinking that we might want to upgrade to a suite since I wasnt too happy about sleeping in double beds so I inquired at the front desk if one was available  I would have booked this earlier but how many people could occupy each suite was very unclear on the website and I even called to ask but that person was not any more helpful about whether we could all fit or if rollaways are allowed  I was told that no suites were available at the front desk but was given a complimentary second room that connected to the other room The only little problem with this arrangement was that we had no view  But having two king size beds and two bathrooms was greatAs mentioned by other reviewers the rooms are very nice  My husband LOVED the chair in the room it was so comfortable The baths were big enough for two so my crazy two dhters put on their swim suits and had fun with the bubble bath that was kindly given to us along with an American Girl doll bed when a worker saw my younger dhter carrying an AG doll in the lobbyOther perks were complimentary movies although they are quite old and free apples and water  However there were a bunch of other munchies near the water with no note to suggest whether these were also complimentary or not  I think anything that has a cost should be listed on a sheet  Anyway I found out that all those snacks are not free  The housekeeper ended up putting the waters next to the bed during turndown but I would have preferred some chocolates  Oh wellAnother problem is the firehouse station being so close  Yes I dont enjoy hearing loud sirens at all hours of the night and I am a sound sleeper  However the hotel is located near all the best shopping so cant complain about that at all  The AG place is right across the street The other perks of the hotel such as the butler service and use of a car are mentioned in their website but not freely offered once you arrive at the hotel  be the info is burried away in some book in a desk but I think the front desk should inform guests directly of these perks  Another slight annoyance is that it is unclear how breakfast is included in your rate  What I mean is that we were supposed to have breakfast as part of our package but we didnt receive any vouchers or info on how to make sure you arent charged for the food  In such a nice place it feels awkward to have to ask when you receive your bill for the full amount  However I did ask and was told it would be deducted later  It hasnt shown up on our bill yet but I would think at least our tip would   I would prefer that the front desk would explain when you check in how the package works so you dont have to feel foolish asking  And I did call down to the front desk right before going to eat and was told I would just have to give them my room number  That wasnt quite how it worked Lastly the pool bottom looks very dirty  My two dhters ided they would rather not swim in it  They provide free water in your car as we discovered after leaving in our cup holders with a note to drive safely  That was niceHope this info helps someone  
P => Wonderful hotel staff unattentive and stuffy My wife and I have stayed at the Park Hyatt several times  On prior visits to Chicago we stayed at the Ritz  a great property also  The Park Hyatt is a magnificent beautiful and very up to date hotel  The staff however still seems to make an effort to be stand offish and cool  Front door service and attitude were very good  Front desk and restaurant personell however leave you feeling less than welcome  We stay at many high end hotels and the Park Hyatt staff remains the most unfriendly  Unfortunate because we thoroughly enjoy this hotel  
P => probably the best place to stay in Chicago I have just returned from a stay at the Park Hyatt  The hotel is stylish and luxurious the service could not be more attentive  You feel save at night  The beds are beyond all description and it is not easy to stand up and leave the room in the morning  We had dinner and breakfast at Nomi  The restaurant offers absolutely stunning views and an elegant atmosphere  The location is unbeatable in the middle of everything  Stay there and escape from everyday reality  
P => Impeccable comfortable stay Bad reviews are much more fun to write and to read but I cannot stop gushing about my recent experience staying the Park Hyatt  First the every member of the hotel staff that I encountered was helpful curteous and a downright joy  The service at the hotel as might be expected was impeccable    solicitous and kind but low key and never in your face  The rooms are large and beautifully appointed  I had a room with a huge bathroom that was arated by a partition from the bedroom  If you saw my review of the W Lakeshore youll know how a design like this can go terribly wrong but at the Park Hyatt everything is perfectly and tastefully executed  I loved soaking in that huge tub loved the touch of the bath salts and the candles and almost wept at the thought that I had to leave to go back to my bathroom at home which while nice doesnt have the view or the huge tub  The food at the hotels restaurant NoMI is not out of this world spectacular but the breakfasts are wonderful especially if they are included in your room package  The view through the restaurants huge windows are enough to make you glad to have woken up at a m  and the house made granola made me come back for more  I also loved the touch of the sea salt and pepper varieties  each provided on the table    my companions spice lovers all could not get enough of the lava salt  I must also say that the pool area is lovely as an early morning swimmer I appreciated the large workout area and the three lap lanes complete with flippers and kick boards  The hotel is certainly on the pricey side but compared to other hotels and what they are charging the price is at least understandable you feel that you are getting quite a bang for your buck  This hotel caters to the guests every whim and need and staffs efforts on my behalf alone cannot be extolled enough  Thank you Park Hyatt for a lovely relaxing and special weekend 
P => Utterly amazing experience I changed my reservation to the Park Hyatt Chicago from the Renaissance A riott hotel after reading the rave reviews on Tripadvisor  I was not disappointed  The entire experience was unbelievable  While it was pricey it was worth every penny for the room and service  If you want spacious well kept luxurious accomodations with impeccable service you will find it here  The location right on the Magnificent Mile also makes this the ideal choice for staying in Chicago  I walked to the Loop Art Institute Oriental Theatre Millenium Park etc  everyday and of course you are close to all of the best shopping When I arrived the bellhop greeted me took my luggage and escorted me to the front desk  He then took my bag upstairs and gave me a tour of my room explaining all of the features and complimentary items  I was speechless from this kind of service They even greeted me by name when I returned to the hotel that evening  The Park King Room looked just as amazing as it did in the hotel website photos really  It was a posh  square feet of contemporary asian design  The room overlooked Water Tower place get one of these rooms if you can  Half of the room was the bathroom which included a glass inclosed walk in shower WC sink and luxurious soaking tub with complimentary bath salts and candles  I took two baths while there and it was soooo relaxing  It was the little touches like that that made this hotel special  There was even a lint brush in the closet and complimentary bottles of spring water and applesIf your worried about sleep dont be  The bed was so comfortable I hardly used the two chairs in the room  There is a fire station down the street and the sirens woke me up a few times the first night  After that I got used to it you have to in a big city and it did not bother me  No slamming doors or noisy guests on my floor and cant imagine that there would ever be at this hotel I had breakfast each morning in NoMi and the service was impeccable  They knew just when to refill your cup of coffee or leave you be  I felt like a could linger as long as I liked and read my complimentary New York Times while overlooking the Water Tower  I also ordered room service two of the nights I was there  Usually room service is acceptable but not here  It was amazing My meals arrived within  mintues both nights and the staff was so personable  The food from NoMi was quite good   Try the fries with spicy onnaise the tomato panzanella salad the raspberry macaroon with ice cream and the refined tea list  There was a mix up with room service one of the nights but the prompt apology and correction of the mistake by the staff made me love this place even moreThe swimming pool was one of the hotels best features  Finally a LAP pool for adults I get sick of pools full of children but except for one night the pool was kid free  The three  yd lanes were perfect for getting a swimming workout  The changing rooms were definitely the nicest I have ever seen  Showers with complimentary amenities lockers robesslippers steam room etc  really made the place nice  The whirlpool and fitness room were also gorgeous and the large windows overlooking the city opened up the place  Even though I didnt use the fitness room I can say that the complimentary fruit flavored ice water was refreshingHousekeeping was prompt and made sure everything looked wonderful before I returned for the day  You actually get TWO housekeeping calls a day and one of them is REAL turndown service shades down music turned on covers folded over etc  If I havent said enough about the staff the parking valets were gracious and overly helpful  I would give this hotel five stars if it were up to me 
P => Intimate Luxurious Hotel The Park Hyatt is fantastic for anyone looking to relax and experience what Chicago has to offer for upscale travelers  It s right on Michigan central to shopping as well as dining on Rush Street  The hotel is very chic and modern with a small lobby and very quiet guest areas  The rooms are fantastic with unobstructed views of Lake Michigan and extremely comfortable beds  Bathroom has great view as well with huge tub and great glass shower  NoMI is a must  on the th level with a wonderful outdoor patio as well as a formal dining room that leans out over Water Tower Place  Sunday brunch buffet is worth it  Hotel has limited business amenities as well as Spa services I would recommend it priily for leisure travelers who are looking to spend most of their time enjoying Chicago  
P => Great Hotel So So Service I stayed at the Park Hyatt last week on  th  I came in town to visit friends and we stayed at the Park Hyatt I requested early check in and was able to get into my hotel at am after my early morning flight arrival  Thank you Park Hyatt  It was wonderful to be able to relax and freshen up after getting up at am My room had a beautiful view of the lake great bathroom and comfortable beds The bell service and security at the hotel were amazing  They did their job very well and were always friendly The downside to the hotel which is keeping me from rating it as excellent is the front desk service and the early close of the restaurant NoMi  I felt as if the front desk didnt want to help  I left my phone charger at home and they said they could provide a charger  After waiting an hour I got a call saying they didnt have a Motorola charger  What That is one of the most common chargers and they didnt have one The nd instance was my request to print out my boarding pass the next morning  I called down around am and asked if they could print out the boarding pass and was told absolutely   minutes later I get a call saying their internet is down  I asked if they could keep trying   hours later when I checked out they still had not printed out the boarding pass and were able to do it while I was standing at the front desk  The desk clerk that I spoke to on the phone  hours earlier had a hard time looking me in they eye and therefore I believe purposely did not think it was worth her time to print out the pass  I was stuck on the nd to last row in the middle seat between  large men  My trip home was awful to say the least I recommend the Park Hyatt but be wary of the front desk service  
P => You will be so SPOILED after this experience I cannot find any negative or inadequate thing about this hotel  I am always travelling on business and never have I stayed at a property that exceeded my expectation at all levels as this place did  From the moment you walk in you get special personalized service from the staff  The lobby is spectacular check out the art collection as it is pretty amazing the checkin painless  The rooms are to die for  They are bright clean stylish and very functional  The bed and pillows were so amazing I wanted to sleep more than ever  The Eames chair the huge tub and the fixtures are out of a or magazine  The bathroom opens up into the room and you can enjoy a bath while watching TV or looking out the window They give complementary shoe shines and pressing nightly  The staff know exactly how to give a combination of superb service and give you personal space  Nomi the restaurant is amazing esp  breakfast and has a gorgeous view of Michigan Ave  And the location cant be beat   right in the heart of the most gorgeous area of Chicago   shop till you drop 
P => Happy th at the Park Hyatt My wife surprised me for my th birthday with a weekend in Chicago  When she told me where we were staying I knew about the Park Hyatts reputation and was not disappointed  The location alone makes it a great headquarters for exploring the best Chicago has to offer  The level of service quality of the room and amenities makes this a cant miss experience if you are willingable to splurge  The view from the th floor looked east down Chicago Ave  with a view of Lake Michigan and the original water works just below the room  We had cocktails and appetizers at Nomi the hotels loungerestaurant  Service was great as were the food and drinks  Good wine list  Casual seating in the lounge on couches and comfortable chairs made for a relaxing experience  We didnt use the free exercise facility but did take a look  One of the best youll find outside of resorts and spas that specialize in fitness  The ble bathroom with large shower and private toilet was nice  My wife would have liked better lighting so a lighted makeup mirror might be in order  There is also a small TV above the mirror  The room features a pillow top mattress pretty standard at most of the nicer establishments flat screen TV with DVD player DVD movies are complimentary and available at front desk and the most comfortable leather lounge chair Ive used in a hotel  The lighting is mostly recessed good for creating a relaxed or romantic atmosphere  On a good weather day and with enough energy you can walk almost anywhere you might want to explore on the Magnificent Mile or lakefront  There are many fine hotels in the immediate area but if you can spring for it the Park Hyatt is a good choice  
P => Loved our Getaway Just returned for a three night stay at the Park Hyatt  My husband and I went away for a weekend sans kids and loved our stay  This was our first trip to Chicago and I did much research on hotels  I chose this one because of TripAdvisor recommendations and Im a Hyatt Gold Passport member Our request for a high floor was honored by the hotel and we had a water view of Lake Michigan  I was disappointed that our room did not have the opening between the bathroom and bedroom that was advertised on the website but it did not spoil our trip  The concierge was extremely helpful and provided some nice dinner suggestions  You must try Cafe Spiaggia  Absolutely the best meal weve ever had  WonderfulI would recommend this hotel and it is a great location  Convenient to all the shopping  I would also recommend the Chicago Architecture Boat Tour  It was a great   hour boat ride on the Chicago River that really showed the great architecture of the city The only negative I would have was the carpet was in need of cleaning  For the cost of the rooms I felt the carpet could have been newer or at least clean  It showed wear and tear and many spots  Overall the rest of the room was great  
P => My new favorite hotel in Chicago I usually stay at the Sofitel Water Tower but at the suggestion of a Chicagoan friend stayed here  It was fabulous Definitely will return  Same for my cousin who lives large amp usually stays at the Peninsula  We were both completely bowled over by the level of service  Spotlessly clean beds amp bedding that were divine phenomenal view amp location quiet a comfy reading chair free wireless a great bath tub for soaking choice of morning newspaper superb staff amp quick room service  The hotel restaurant Nomi is sophisticated amp pricey but outstanding  Honest I dont usually use so many superlatives amp I am not a plant  I simply could find no fault here  It was worth every penny  
P => Park Hyatt Chicago is the tip top This review is a little late but now that Im planning another trip Im remembering just how great my stay at the Park Hyatt Chicago was  My boyfriend and I went to Chicago for a weekend get a away  I did quite a bit of research as to where to stay and made multiple reservations   The Peninsula W  However all reviews of the Park Hyatt were positive and from the photos on their Web site it looked spectacular Everything went well on the trip  From the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff was the epitome of professionalism  Our room was ready at  pm and our check in was swift  The room met all expectations   it was roomy on an upper floor with a stunning view of Water Tower Place and Lake Michigan  The best part of the room was the bathroom   spectacular  The soaking tub with the sliding doors providing a view to the city was heaven especially at night  The facilities gym pool and whirlpool were great  We lucked out because most of the time we were there nobody was using them so it felt like our own private gym and pool  We didnt eat at the restaurant Nomi but it looked lovely and it was crowed  We did have drinks and light fare one night at the lounge and it was great  The food was delicious and the atmosphere delightful  As for the location you cant beat it  You are literally at the center of everything  I went to see the The Peninsula next door  I chose the Park Hyatt because it was cheaper  From what I saw it was not worth the extra money and I was glad that I chose the Park Hyatt  All in all the hotel is tip top  I highly recommend it and will be returning  
P => Park Hyatt is a cool hotel My  year old dhter and I stayed  nights      at the Park Hyatt  Chicago  The location was great we had a view out the bathroom window of the American Girl store and Ralph Lauren storea great lunch A view of the charming Water Tower too  We booked directly thru the hotel because all booking sites said there were no rooms avail  We paid  first nite  next  nites AAA rate  I couldnt believe hotel costs in the middle of   More than we pd  in NYC last summer As a comparison Ritz Carlton was  per nite  Dont forget the   tax The Hyatt did have very nice bathrooms dbl sinks huge tub with candles provided arate toilet room lots of fluffy towels robes  We were on the th floor which was quite noisy  We learned that the firehouse was a block away  Yikes A siren all the time be a higher floorThe lobby is chic and dark a good lobby for celebrities to sneak into  The staff is attentive  Some more negatives The room did not have black out curtains in lieu of cooler more modern shadesThe TV was not a flat screen but was encased in a mod cabinetLocation location location thats the justification for the price 
P => Beautiful Hotel    this review is late late late    but looking back it was a wonderful stay  Very elegant hotel deserving of its  star status  LOVED the soaking tub as well as the spacious ble bathroom  it could be very romantic for a couple looking to spend some quality time together The spa Tiffany Kim is nice   good facials  but for a more quottruequot spa experience try Tiffany Kims flagship spa on W  Superior  Oh   the beds are comfy   but theres just something about the beds at Sofitel that are simply plush cozy and amazingHave a great trip   wish i were there now 
P => Great Hotel   Great Location The Park Hyatt in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in the BEST location in the city  Overlooking the historical water tower right in the heartof the Miracle Mile   right next to the best bars and restaurants  Theservice is great and the staff very friendly  Our view was of the water tower with the lake in the background on both of our stays  RoomService is very good too   and while it is expensive   its not as crazy as some other  star hotels Ive stayed at  
P => No boughs of holly    While The Peninsula and the Intercontinental quotked the hallsquot the Park Hyatts holiday or was minimal at best   practically non existent  As a receptionist explained quotIt was at the owners discretion and ision quot It was our single greatest disappointment  Otherwise the hotel was very nice  We had a problem with a noisy family next door our first day and managment immediately moved us to a higher much quieter location From our window seat and birds eye view on the th floor we watched the shoppers below on Michigan Avenue  Michigan Avenue itself made up for the lack of holiday orations in the hotel lobby The Park Hyatts central location by the Water Tower could not have been more perfect for access to shopping restaurants theatres and Holy Name Cathedral While the room was very nice and comfortable What other hotel would dare use WHITE bed linens AND comforters for the price I noticed a few quotlittle thingsquot  Towels were worn and tired  Although I asked for face cloths only hand towels were delivered  Wash cloths seemed to be scarce The bathroom was huge with arate shower and a soaking tub with a small TV above the sink  But there was no ent lighting for applying makeup  The granite vanity in front of the window would have been perfect but the bathroom was just too dark even with the blind open  While most  star hotels have added LCD or plasma TVs the Park Hyatt still has dated flat screens  Overalll though we enjoyed our stay  Managment and the concierge could not have been more helpful and pleasant  I just wish there had been just a little more fa la la la la  
P => Wonderful stay at the Park Hyatt Chicago My husband amp I stayed at the Park Hyatt last weekend  for his th birthday  I had researched hotels quite a bit before our trip and am very happy that I chose the Park Hyatt over the Peninsula  We did have a drink in the Peninsula lobby  Lovely hotel but a little too traditionally orated for my taste When I made the Park Hyatt reservation I requested a lake view  Once we were there however they said all the lake views were quotcommitted quot I ided to at least take a look at the city view but once we got to the room I did not like the city view at all I called the front desk  They looked into it apologized profusely and found a room with a lake view on the th floor that would be ready in about  minutes  They sent the bellman up for our bags and he escorted us to the library just off the lobby where we were served complimentary champagne  Our new room was ready about  minutes later  Not only did it have a beautiful lake view but it was a corner room so we had windows on two sides  FantasticThe hotel was beautiful and the staff was very gracious  We will definitely stay there again  
P => Great hotel in a nice location The limodriver from the hotel met me at the airport  The drive into the city and the check in was very smooth  I had ordered wine and charcuteries to be in my room at   when I checked in  It came after an hour and after two reminders The room had a terrace facing watertower place  It was nice weather and great to spend some time at the terrace  The room was great and the bed fantastic as was the bathroom  There was only one door facing the daylight and I thought the room was a bit dark The maid who cleaned my room was very nice and helpful I was disappointed with NoomI restaurant  Not so much choice for breakfast  Sashimi not perfect  For dinner I wanted a glass of champagne   the sommelier poured my glass and then said   what do You think I think it is totally without bubbles    was my reply I guess You are right he said I will open a new bottle for You  A perfect thing to do but in a  star restaurant this should never happen as the waiters should always check the condition of what they serve  An italian restaurant nearby   the Rosebud gave much better service at a more normal price  
P => Stylish hotel in a great location I stayed at the Park Hyatt for two nights on business  Although a little more expensive than the other nearby chains it was well worth it and they offer a AAA discount The room was good sized I had the least expensive room very clean and very stly laid out  arate tub and shower quiet and comfortable The hotel is just a block from great shopping and a short cab ride to almost everything else  I would definitely stay here again Its not quite to the level of a great Four Seasons i e  San Fransisco or Hawaii but a very classy nice hotel and not nearly as   
P => Excellent for my second stay I stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for two days   Sunday ust    Tuesday ust   I had originally booked a Terrace room but it was overcast and rainy so I took a Grand Deluxe  king on the th floor this is the top floor of the hotel all higher floors are condos This is such a velous hotel  The location cant be beat and everyone seems so very eager to help  I ordered room service twice during my stay requested one of the complimentary DVDs from the library had a couple of items fetched from my car all cars are valet parked and the guest does not have access to this garage as far as I know and all requests were handled professionally and graciously  I also had them bring me a table fan as I like to sleep with white noise  No problemThe doormen are really great  They were always very attentive when I walked in or out the door  They eagerly offered to hail taxi cabs offered me an umbrella offered weather forecasts etc Same goes for the rest of the staff  I didnt find much occasion to use the front desk or interior staff members but they recognized me warmly if I ever looked their way on my way out to the street  The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job as well  When I got back into the hotel from walking about the city the room looked as it did when I first checked in  Id like to try and make it back to Chicago when it gets colder and when I do ill definitely be booking a room at the Park Hyatt  Ive heard the Peninsula FS and RC are all fantastic but the Park Hyatt has a Gold Passport rewards program that ive been using so I will likely stick with the PH  
P => Perfect This hotel is beautiful and offers an exceptional blend of service and style  The hotel itself is a part of an upscale private condo building on Michigan avenue and extends through the th floor  While relaxing at the property you can dine at NoMI or enjoy small plates and a cigar at the NoMI lounge  Breakfast in bed The room service is extensive and includes sushi and in room dining treats  The hotel has an excellent health club butler service and also a courtesy car  This hotel is the best in the city  The experience is more personalized and the property both professional and a retreat  The rate can run high    with the best rates on the weekends  A 
P => Absolutely loved this hotel This is a fabulous hotel  Set right on Michigan Avenue our suite looked out onto the historic Water Tower with Lake Michigan in the background  With  full sized ble bathrooms and a very large master bedroom this is a luxury treat to say the least  The staff is friendly and accomodating and made us feel very special  We will definitely stay here next time  It is expensive but very well worth every dollar  Kudos to Park Hyatt 
P => Good location We stayed here for  nights over  NY  Rooms The rooms are rather small for American standards  Our room didnt have a bath only a walk in shower and it was a small bathroom for  adults and  young children  It was a wonder we all actually fit inside the room   there were  queen beds  We had to put our luggage on the floor as there was just no space  When we mentioned about the lack of bathtub for our young children the hotel said they would follow up but never did get back to us  Restaurant We only had breakfast at the hotel  I recommend the Park breakfast only   it was very very good  Room service No kids menu  Location You cant beat the location of this hotel  Service It was alright nothing to rave about  Generally this hotel is catered for adults and business travellers  Not kids friendly at all  Great for the single traveller on business  
P => Great service location room views we arrived after midnight from ohare with my wife and two small kids  the hotel staff helped us get to our room quickly and checked back with us after we settled in for a couple minutes to see if everything was ok  they offered cookies and milk for the kids and adults which was a huge bonus after a long day of travel  fantastic east facing view of the lake water tower hancock  great workout facility and pool  location also couldnt be better  i cant wait to go back  
P => Best Hotel in Chicago Just got back from  nights at the Park Hyatt   Chicago  We had a standard room on the th floor with an excellent view of the Watertower and Lake Pros The rooms were excellent  Clean Modern and very well thought out  The extra large soaking tub and arate shower were very nice as well as the small TV in the bathroom  Also the location of the hotel was terrific along with outstanding service food and a nicely equiped Gym on the th floor Cons The coffee  Really its my only gripe of a nearly perfect hotel  On five occassions the coffee was served lukewarm weak and had an odd flavor  It was consistently bad via Room Service and in the otherwise wonderful NoMi restaurant  Otherwise you will NOT go wrong in choosing the Park Hyatt in Chicago   definitely among my favorite hotels  Ill also note that we originally booked at the Four Seasons just across the street   we went there for cocktails and although its a lovely hotel it seemed a bit dated and worn along with what seemed to be a very uptght clientele  The Park Hyatt had a more relaxed yet still upscale vibe  
P => Loved the Park Hyatt The Park Hyatt is one of nicest hotels in Chicago actually one of the nicest in the US  Excellent location excellent service excellent rooms and amenities  There is nothing bad to say about this hotel  Pricey but worth it  
P => Loved It and What a Bathroom  Simply sensational Park Hyatt   first time in Chicago and a hotel that didnt disappoint at all Prime location opposite the Water Tower situated in the heart of N Michigan Avenue Superbly attentive staff from the friendly doormen through to the concierge and bellhops Room was one of the finest and most comfortable I have ever stayed in and an utterly luxurious bathroom   housekeeping even arranged toiletries symmetrically Not cheap but you get what you pay for  
P => Fantastic just returned from a two night stay at the park hyatt chicago   it was a great   the rooms are large the bath products are amazing the food amp wine at the restaurant nomi is divine the outdoor bar area is the best place in chicago on a sunny day   our whole experience at the park hyatt was wonderful   the staff was so friendly and overall the hotel had a very good vibe   i did not want to leave and i dont even like chicago that much stayed at the drake dark shabby old room with a small bathroom and we were on the executive floor while in chiacago as well and there is no comparison that you should def stay at the park hyatt 
P => Great stay at the Park Hyatt My wife and I stayed at the Park Hyatt in il   Excellent service wonderful room friendly staff  Our room overlooked the Water Tower and was absolutely beautiful  The hotel is fairly new and the room was well appointed with a comfortable bed luxury bath sliding wall to view the city from the soaking tub and two flat screen tvs  The lake is about  blocks up from the hotel and one morning I went for a run on the lake shore trail  Upon my return I was greeted by one of the doormen who handed me a bottled water  Nice  
P => Great stay at the Park Hyatt   My husband and I spent a weekend at the Park Hyatt a few weeks ago  I couldnt resist booking an executive suite when I saw that one was available  After I booked it I was a little wary because there were no pictures of the executive suites anywhere on the Internet  I saw the picturesvideos of the nicer suites but they were too expensive  When we arrived we had a quick and easy check in  I happen to love that Hyatt makes you prepay when you book online   saves you the hassle of having to pay when you get there  The suite was absolutely lovely    it was HUGE  I will be adding photos soon    it was very tastefully appointed and extremely spacious  I dont know how the nicer suites are but Id say that the executive is luxorious enough    you dont need to get a nicer one The location as everyones already stated is great  Its close to all the shopping and literally right in front of the water tower  Our suite faced the water tower so we had an amazing view   especially at night  One thing I will say is DONT RENT A CAR unless you absolutely have to  The entrance to the hotel is right on an extremely busy street so when you pull over for the valet you  end up causing traffic  Also they park your car in a garage  minutes away so theres always a long wait for your car  The hotels close to everything anyway so you should just walk or take a cab  They offer a courtesy car within a  mile range but we didnt use it In short it is a great hotel and we cant wait to go back  
P => Wonderful Hotel and Location I just returned from a weekend at the Park Hyatt  I arrived there at  am on a Friday with the expectation that I would leave my bag with the bellman before heading out to the Cubs game  To my surprise a room was ready for me and I was able to take my stuff upstairs  I was on the th floor with a city view  The room had a king size bed and large bathroom with arate tub and shower area  It also had free high speed internet access a DVD player stereo and connect for an I Pod The staff of the hotel could not have been nicer  Not only was I able to get a late check out on Sunday  pm but the staff was friendly and willing to help each time we came in and out of the hotel The hotel is in a wonderful location next to the Water Tower across the street from America Girl Place and within walking distance of all Miracle Mile shops and the Red Line of the El I look forward to being able to return  In fact my wife already asked when we can stay there again 
P => Great hotel Love this hotel  We went as  adults and  little girls who wanted to go to American Girl Place which is directly across the street  The staff at this hotel could not have been more accomodating  We had  connecting rooms and had ordered the American Girl package which included beds for the dolls to sleep in robes and slippers for the kids kid shampoo and conditioner milk and cookies   Worth every penny as the kids were thrilled  The hotel restuarant was lovely for breakfast  Beds were extremely comfortable  It was perfect Highly recommended  
P => a heavenly oasis in a perfect location My dhter and I recently returned from a quotjust the girlsquot weekend in Chicago  We were absolutely delighted with the accommodations at the Park Hyatt Chicago  The room was meticulously clean and filled with amenities  From the over sized window seat to the comfortable bed the quiet surroundings the luxurious bath we felt immediately comfortable and at home  It was a pleasure to return to our room each evening after a fun filled day of shopping along the Magnificent Mile  Even an unexpected late ruary snowfall added to the ambiance of Chicago  The Park Hyatt is perfectly situated directly in front of the historic Watertower  It is literally only steps away from shopping heaven  For the young and young at heart the American Girl store is right across the street  A  hour Walgreens is adjacent to the hotel as is an open late Ghiradellis Ice Cream shop and a Borders  Despite the modern store fronts nearby the hotel is pleasantly quiet and relaxing  Our  hour stay in Chicago included the theatre  We saw quotWickedquot our third time seeing but our first time seeing in Chicago and our favorite musical of all time  quotWickedquot is at Chicagos beautifully restored circa s Oriental Theatre a treat in and of itself  The Park Hyatt is only a walk away from excellent casual and more formal dining  We kept it pretty casual this time and enjoyed pizza at Giardinos Wow Baos at Watertower Plaza and breakfast with chocolate fondue  at Pierrot Gourmet  The Park Hyatt has enormous style  We never felt quotprocessedquot  The staff was always accessible and quite willing to give friendly personal service  The hotel lobby sitting areas and room furnishings are very stylish  We loved the sliding panels by the oversized bath tub that could be opened or closed for privacy The room lighting was fantastic  Towels were abundant not always the case in many hotels  Theres  hour room service which wasnt needed but is certainly appreciated The Park Hyatt is a manageably sized hotel with first class service and style in the heart of bustling Chicago  We would not hesitate to return and recommend to others  
P => Im not sure it could have been any better      My partner and I booked a Terrace Room at the Chicago Park Hyatt for the weekend of    to celebrate our birthdays  I know it was a little silly to book the Terrace Room on a weekend where the high was around  degrees but I wanted a special room and we were not disappointedFirst of all the check in was seamless   everything about our reservation was in perfect order and the desk clerk escorted us to the elevator  The Terrace Rooms are on the rd floor   a quick ride up the elevator  After entering the room you are in a small quotfoyer quot The bedroom portion of the room is large with a king bed leather chair large desk and TVstorage unit  Then there is a large set of sliding french doors that open out onto the terrace  Now the terrace is not what you usually expect from a hotel  Usually a hotel balcony or terrace is large enough for  small chairs and a little table to put a drink on  This was HUGE Since it was winter there was no furniture available but it was big enough for a cocktail party for  people There  have been more square feet than the actual roombathroom   which was  sq ft  AND THE VIEW You looked out right onto the historic water tower and Michigan Avenue  Since you are on the rd floor you dont get much of a lake view but with everything else there is to look at it is not missed Now back to the room     actually the bathroom  in the hallway leading to the bathroom there is a small bar and the closet  The closet isnt large but has an ironing board iron hair dryer safe various hangars and shoe polisher  Then the bathroom When you walk in you see a glass shower door   through that door is the shower and bathtub    all in one room with a window looking out onto the terrace and the Water Tower  The tub is huge probably big enough for  and the shower has  heads    one stationary and one hand held  They dont work at the same time but the water pressure is great  Then back into the bathroom there is a large vanity with double sinks   and a small wall mounted TV with a remote control  Next to that there is a small vanity with a bench for putting on make up and such  And the toilet is in a rarate water closet  There is also a closet door that opens into the other side of the closet in the hallway which is very convenient The room or is simple  Black and white photos and taupe carpet  The bedding is all white and the furniture is contemporary medium stained wood  Besides lamps there is recessed lighting over the bed in the hallways and in the bathroom Service for the room was provided twice a day  Our cost for the room with the AAA discount was  a night which included breakfast for  both mornings at NoMI the hotel restaurant    more about that in the restaurant section As many have noted before the location couldnt be better  Since we are familiar with Chicago we use public transportation but cabs are readily available all around We cant stay here everytime we stay in Chicago due to the cost but wed sure like to  Were definitely planning on staying here again for a special occasion  
P => A great hotel in a great location in a great city The Park Hyatt should be at the top of everyones list  The experience was great from arrival through check in the room the view  And it was the staff that made it all come together It is a bit pricey but we used a Hyatt Gold Passport award to cover one of the rooms so it averaged out OK  I cant say enough about the staff  The desk clerk escorted us to the elevators when we checked in  The doorman and concierge had plenty of suggestions for dining  When we stopped by the restaurant NoMI in the morning to get some coffee to go we were told they didnt have disposible cups but the greeter called down to the desk to make sure they were still serving complementary coffee even though it was later in the day  On the way to the pool located in the spa we were welcomed numerous times and my teenage son even commented on the hospitality  And the spa locker facilities are very nice  And no extra charge for pool and gym The rooms were very great and the view spectacular  See my photo showing the Water Tower Michigan Ave Contemporary Art Museum and Lake Michigan  Sunday morning we got a Chicago Tribune and New York Times delivered to each room  The location is perfect especially on a cold ember day  Right off Michigan Ave near shopping and restaurants galore My highest recommendation 
P => Good   Not Great We stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago ember      Here is my impressionCheck in Fairly quick and friendly  The agent walked us to the elevator and explained the amenties of the hotel Room Great  Very upscale wonderful bed down duvet and featherbed  The bathrooms were excellent with arate tub shower and water closet  Also a small television was positioned above the vanity   a very nice touch Staff As was previously mentioned the front desk staff were good the doormen helpful  The housekeeping staff assigned to our room were unpolished  A housekeeper actually opened our door to ask us how much longer we would be and if we would be checking out that day  I had checked with the front desk and verified that we at least  minutes prior to the check out time  I would have put the do not disturb on the door except after we slept in the first day the sign miraculously dissapeared Also the concierge was impossible to reach via telephone  My husband and I tried phoning on several occasions and received voicemail Id expect that at a Hilton but not Park Hyatt Food With so many great locations near the hotel we only had to have breakfast in the hotel  The food was your typical hotel breakfast   nothing more but certainly not worth the  I paid for my bacon and egg entree  I realize that city prices are expensive but having stayed at numerous Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons properties I have come to expect more for the money  Do yourself a favor skip breakfast and go to the Hershey store located just outside the front door and get a great hot chocolate and wait until lunchLocation The hotel is in a great location and shares the same streets as the Penisula and Ritz Carlton  Several reviewers wrote about the sirens around the hotel  Certainly it is noisy but the people paying  a night at the Penisula hear it too  The hotel is near the Water Tower Shopping Center and Neiman cus  After your hot chocolate grab a cab and head to the Chicago Chop House for a great steak lunch  Soup Salad Filet Mignon and desert run   at lunch and are as good as any other city steakhouse  
P => Another GREAT Park Hyatt stay Stayed  night  Got upgraded as I stayed here before but it was a long time ago Exeutive suite overlooking the water tower  Beautiful Welcome and check in fantastic as was service in the room and bar Highly recommended cannot fault it  
P => park hyatt always comes through In the heart of down town Chicago couldnt be a better location for shopping site seeing  restaurants etc Friendly efficient  helpful hotel staff always quoton the ballquot  Rooms are beautiful big comfy beds large windows huge bathrooms with erate showers and a erate toilet  We had a seating area which not all rooms have  Efficient prompt room service  Restaurant was very good food to quotdie forquotthe only problem was you have to walk through the bar area to get to the restaurant the bar area gets very smoky in the evening   be warned  Great fitness center and pool which is in with the price of the room   a nice feature  In all a very enjoyable  days  well worth the price  
P => Luxurious Comfort Stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for  nights in tember and had a very pleasant stay  The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago and has great views over the Water Tower and Lake Michigan  The room Deluxe King was high quality with one of the most comfortable beds Ive ever experienced  The bathroom was also luxurious with its own mini TV and arate shower  Theres also a screen between the bathroom and bedroom allowing you to bathe looking out over Chicago if you desire  The hotel service was very attentive if a little formal and the facilities were top notch  The restaurant and bar were also high quality  Theres a fairly high price tag on rooms in this hotel but you do get what you pay for  It was a real treat to stay here  
P => Attention to detail with few exceptions Checked in    for a one night quick business trip stay  My dhter made the reservation obtaining a very attractive rate available to her employer a big  accounting firm  My travel budget wouldnt have afforded my staying here otherwise  The young lady at reception noting that it was my first stay there and after determining that I didnt need assistance with my small overnight bag personally walked me to the elevator lobby    a nice expression of hospitality  The room was impressively large and very well appointed even having an Eames lounge chair and ottoman for relaxation in front of the expansive windows which included small windows on either side of a large picture window that were openable allowing fresh air if desired  There was also a long window seat with a comfortable cushion and ample throw pillows for relaxing and enjoying the view from my location on the th floor looking west  The bed was very comfortable with a duvet using high quality linens  The bathroom was particularly impressive with a large soaking tub that was easily big enough for two  They even provided large candles for a romantic bathing experience and have large sliding wooden doors adjacent to the tub that open the view to the bedroom area and the city lights view out the windows  The arate shower are enclosed in floor to ceiling thick glass panels had both a tall shower head and a arate adjustable head that could be removed from its holder for hand operation  Much ble attractive wood mirrors glass and excellent lighting  In fact lighting throughout the room and bathroom was rekable for the variety of options available for creating different kinds of lighting combinations  The TVentertainment area included a DVD player  A nice touch was in addition to the high end glossy magazines typically found in hotels at this quality level there were several books including one that had fascinating information and photographs on Chicago architecture  Another interesting detail was a large bowl of potpourrie on the chest of drawers  I found the fragrance pleasant but a bit strong  Of course you can hide that in a drawer if it offends  A few details were missed though  Some of the chrome fixtures in the bathroom could stand polishing more frequently to avoid dust or corrosion  Also the sliding doors between the bathroom and bed area were apparently somewhat off track not allowing them to come together properly to completely close off view between the two areas  All in all I thought the Chicago Park Hyatt was a top end hotel with its guests receiving a very good experience  At their regular rates you get good value for the money  At the deeply discounted corporate rate I enjoyed it was a tremendous value  
P => A Perfect Stay My wife and I spent three nights at this hotel in late ober  I would have to rate it as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in  The rooms were well designed spacious and well appointed  Your every need in the room has been anticipated  We had a great view of Lake Michigan  Each day we had breakfast in NoMI and drinks each night in NoMi Lounge  Both were impressive especially the excellent breakfast looking out at the Lake However what impressed me the most was the outstanding staff  It was obvious that each had been well trained in how to deliver excellent guest service and did they ever do so  It appeared that each definitely bought in to the customer service concept and their attitude reflected it  From the doorman to the bellman to the front desk to the waiters to the housekeeping staff and to the maintenance staff I was always addressed by name and each seemed that fulfilling my needs was the most important duty they had at the moment This is not an inexpensive hotel but you get more than your moneys worth Congratulations to the Park Hyatt manager and his staff  They are truly outstanding  
P => Elegant and excellent service We had our reception at the hotel  The service was excellent  The hotel is gorgeous  The rooms are beautiful with great views of the original Water Tower  Food is fantastic  The in house gym is ent  I cant wait to return 
P => Heads up on sirens Be aware the Park Hyatt Chicago is located very near a hospital and a fire station  If your room is on the Water Tower side of the hotel you  be hearing sirens virtually any time day or night  They were frequent loud and annoying during our stay  The hotel staff did offer to switch our room when we realized the situation  Unfortunately we had already unpacked and completely settled into our room  In hindsight we should have changed  The noise is significant and especially a negative in the evening  If this would be a concern for you recommend asking about your room location and its possible siren factor when booking or checking in  
P => Very good property Just returned from a four night stay  The hotel is perfectly located and has very professional staff  The rooms are very nice and the bathrooms are beautiful  The hotel itself is relatively small so it has something of a boutique feel to it   which is good  I would certainly recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here again  
P => Impeccable service great locationwonderful property Just completed a one night stay ust  at the Park Hyatt  The place has a very upscale feeling as soon as you walk into the lobby  Everyone at the front desk is extremely professional  They were not able to honor my upgrade certificate and offered no sort of benefit for my disappointment  Check in was painless yet it should be for the price of the rooms here  Purchased a King deluxe that promised a view and the view did not disappoint  This was a getaway weekend with my husband and I wanted to go all out and make it special  The room was very attractive Zen like  Huge tub that had wonderful hot water that is temperature controlled  Amazing for a nice relaxing soak  Room was immaculate with a beautiful view of the water and Michigan Avenue  Hotel is right across the street from Ralph Lauren and American Girl Store  There is a bus stop right across the street from the hotel that takes you down to the Navy Pier and travels along Michigan Avenue  You can purchase a CTA transit card on their website prior to travel  If you want to book the courtesy car a BMW you are better off doing that a couple of weeks prior to arrival throught the concierge  Ramon the driver is very professional and was very prompt in taking us to our dinner location  We dined at NoMi and the service is top shelf  The waiters are extremely attentive and professional  We had breakfast and the view is wonderful  The staff at the hotel are definitely well trained people  Service is impeccable  My husband used the gym and raved about the equipment the personnel and yes the pitchers of ice cold water with fresh fruit in it  If you are looking for a luxury hotel this is a great bet  For a special stay I will be back in a heart beat  
P => It lives up to its name I just stumbled across some reviews for the Chicago Park Hyatt and had to add my two cents  This is truly a special property The name and stature of Park Hyatt hotels does not connote a small boutique hotel but somehow that is the feel  Its like having a personal residence in the middle of this great city  Very well located couldnt be better situated for North Michigan Avenue excitement Water Tower hotels shopping etc  and the rooms like to whole hotel environment is extemely comfortable    not the slightest bit stuffy or elitest  This hotel is about luxury yet it doesnt have to scream quotlook at mequot Our initial assigned room was nicely appointed but perhaps the worse view    northwest corner    I dont think we were paying a high rate    the bell person immediately called the front desk and requested a better room for my wife and I without our even having to ask The next room was a similar location but higher floor and much better light and vantage  We had the concierge make reservations for theatre restaurants etc  and they even offered us the chauffered house car which makes the evening that little bit more special  The staff are top notch a real credit to the Hyatt World  That was our second stay ay the Park Hyatt Chicago   the first time in the old property they tore down  We look forward to staying again on our next visit to the Windy City  P S  Stay away from the Hyatt Convention Hotel by the river    its obvious that these two properties have nothing in common other than their parent company  
P => Perfect stay I have been using TripAdvisor to choose hotels for a few years but never felt the urge to write a review   that is until now  I was so overwhelmed by my stay at the Park Hyatt I felt it was worth sharing  The rooms are impeccable  The staff from the door guys to the front desk to the cleaning people are rekably helpful and friendly  The location of this Hyatt is outstanding  One couldnt possibly ask for anything more in this wonderful city 
P => Great Experience at the Park Hyatt Stayed for two nights at the Park Hyatt  The view from our room was spectacular  Lake Michigan and the water tower The room was beautiful and the staff exceptional  Robin from the hotel contacted us before out stay and was very accomodating  The location was perfect and NOMI outstanding  Cant wait to return again  
P => Like it Better than Penninsula So enjoyed hotel  Love the serrene modern Asian or  Have also spent much time at Peninsula obviously both outstantding just like modernity of Park Haytt more beds and linens superior at Park Hyatt wonderful deep tub and bath could link my ipod into stereo tv system Had dinner at hotel restaraunt and found excellent food or and service  Prompt morning breakfast room service  Amex Platinum services of lunch and included breakfast very worthwhile  
P => Stunning I stayed at this hotel whilst in the US for a conference  It was just stunning The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was fantastic the bath was the biggest bath I have ever seen the service impeccable and the food excellent  It is well located at the end of MIchigan Avenue near the big shops  I would definitely stay there again 
P => Absolutely fantastic The Park Hyatt is without a doubt the best hotel in Chicago  My girlfriend and I spent a weekend here just for a romantic getaway and theres no doubt well be back The check in process was so smooth and seamless   far better than any other hotel weve been to  We requested to be put on the highest floor possible and that was done with no problem whatsoever  We had the King Deluxe room and were very happy with it  The bed was so comfortable   it had a Sealy Posturepedic mattress with a downfeather bed over it a duvet and down pillows  of them I might add The roman shades were a very nice touch as were the mood lights  The bathroom was all ble and had a large soaking tub with Davis Gate bath products and a huge walk in shower with  shower heads  There was also an LCD tv mounted on the wall a nice glass scale and  bathrobes all set to go There was a low fog that night being on the th floor it was especially noticeable so we turned down the lights opened the shades and turned on some soft music while relaxing with a glass of wine   very romantic to be sitting there high above the city in that kind of atmosphere looking out at the lights and cars through the mist The minibar had a ent selection however it was very pricy  For a can of Pepsi they charged    Breakfast for myself was a bowl of Raison Bran  pieces of white toast and a glass of milk which ended up costing    So theres definitely a huge k up but to stay here and pamper yourself   its worth it The room was turned down twice a day and the housekeeping staff is absolutely fantastic  There wasnt a single spot or a stain anywhere to be found   not even a water spot in the tub or shower  If you can splurge and stay here by all means do so You wont regret it 
P => Great but not best    The Park Hyatt is a very nice hotel in most respects  The rooms are nice though some are small however the bathrooms have always been ample  For the money I think that the Peninsula still wins hands down  Larger completely ked out rooms more people providing service throughout and a superior spa  When it is booked Ill stay at the PH however as it is quite nice and in a great location  
P => The best hotel in Chicago Ive stayed at Park Hyatt in Chicago couple times now  Everytime I go there i have a wonderful time  Even a doorman remembers me He mustve liked my car btw i dont drive ferrari or porsche  lol You will know that youll have a good experience once you walked into the door  The lobby is VERY quiet and nicely designed  You wont believe it is in middle of downtown Chicago  That was my first impression  Room is spectacular  Very nice furniture nice linens nice sound system and such  Ive had breakfast there and it was good  Nothing spectacular but good  I heard the dinner there is wonderful too  Id like to try it sometimes  This hotel is sure expensive but if you have a chance its worth to stay 
P => One of the Best We stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for two nights at the tail end of a businesspleasure trip and we loved every minute of it  From beginning to end the staff service and facility were outstanding  Upon early arrival we were greeted at the door by friendly but vigilant personnel   I appreciated this measure of discreet security throughout our stay  The gentleman who assisted us at the front desk upgraded us to what we later discovered was a deluxe king room on the eighth floor with unsurpassed window seat views of the Water Tower downtown and Lake Michigan  Since our room was not yet ready he had our luggage stored safely while we went sightseeing  Upon return we found that our luggage had already been brought to our room  Soft music from the sound system was playing and the room was warmly lit by the soft glow of the city below  Very romantic beginning of our stay  After a long day of walking I really appreciated the soaking tub which was surrounded by candles and a jar of aromatherapy bath crystals  The bed enrobed with Frette linens was phenomenally cozy and comfortable  During our stay we enjoyed room service expensive the fitness center which is a very clean fully equipped gym pool and spa with friendly staff and breakfast in NoMi expensive  I cant imagine staying anywhere else   the intimate understated and boutique feel of the Park Hyatt coupled with a well trained attentive staff makes this a must stay in Chicago for discerning business or leisure travelers couples seeking romance or families with well behaved children   the hotel is truly outstanding at all levels Chicago is a shoppers culture hounds and foodies dream   there is a myriad of dining establishments within walking distance from which to choose and a visit to the Signature Room near the top of the Hancock Tower for evening cocktails is a must do  
P => LOVED IT This is a beautioful hotel in an awesome location with well above average accomodations and service  Nice to see this given the trend in the USA to homogenize all hotels and turn them into personality free clones  
P => Loved my room I booked a King Deluxe room a couple weekends ago  I received a wonderful room with a great view of the Water Tower and the lake  The room has almost everything you could ask for  There was a great window seat extending across the whole window and a very comfortable Eames lounge chair  The bed was with down everything from the pillows to the duvet to the feather bed I slept on top of  There was a DVD player and also a speaker plug to attach your iPod to  The bathroom had a small LCD tv with surround sound attached above the double sinks  The amenities were comprehensive and included candles above the large soaking tub  The glass enclosed shower was arate and well as the toilet commode  The best thing is that the bathroom had sliding doors by the soaking tub that opened so you could see the view out the window  Service was courteous and great all around from the doormen to the server in NoMi  The craziest thing is that I never saw a housekeeping service cart in the hallways  Im not sure when housekeeping came by but I was never once disturbed when I was in my room  Overall the hotel had the feel of a boutique hotel to me very quiet and cosy  The location cannot be beat  I walked everywhere  I would recommend the hotel for people who enjoy modern luxury  
P => Couldnt find one fault A great hotel  rooms are modern with a nice large bathroom with arate shower and tub  good location  close to stores restaurants  Most important was the friendly service  Everyone said hello asked if we needed anything and did their best to make the stay so nice  There are a number of deluxe hotels right around the park hyatt but this is the most modern of them if thats your taste and the service couldnt be better anywhere else  Just make sure if you reserve through the  hyatt number you ask for the park hyatt as there are a few hyatt hotels in chicago and i almost reserved the wrong one  
P => We loved the Park Hyatt We stayed at the Park Hyatt for a three night getaway in ruary  No need to repeat all the accolades here   we agree with all of them  We can clarify the confusion about sliding doors   the double rooms have a two person arate shower no sliding doors  The king rooms have a sliding door between the bed and the tub single person shower  A couple of minor quibbles   we also found the bathroom lighting a bit dim   there is no lighted make up mirror so it is hard to see well and close at the same time  The TV is mediocre with an acceptable but not wide range of channels  And being chocolate addicts we missed having a mint or truffle on our pillow at night Although we preferred the privacy of our room if you want large ornate public areas youd be better off elsewhere   there is very little public space   a library and a small sitting area We only had breakfast at Nomi   nice food but pricey We did not use the spa at the property choosing instead to visit the larger venue a few blocks away  You can find that review elsewhere on this site You cannot really go wrong at the property   the location room comfort and omnipresent friendly staff are as good as it gets in Chicago  We had a wonderful time and would certainly return 
P => Great stay at the Park Hyatt I took my family including two preteen children to the Park Hyatt for a couple of nights to get a tourists eye view of Chicago and cant think of one offputting thing the hotel offered  Our arrival was smooth and the room and view were incredible  The health club facilities along with the pool were top notch and the restaurant NoMi was beyond expectation  This obviously isnt anywhere near the budget or mid range neighborhood but the value is there which is more than I can say of the American Girl Place accross the street but Ill save that for another review perhaps  
P => STUNNING park hyatt was trully truly outstanding  i felt like a like a celebrity of sorts    everyone of the staff went out of their way to be helpful  the rooms were unbelievable    sliding door btw a huge tub two tvs and a king size bed  the location is the most central of any hotel in chicago  if you had to put a finger on the center of chicago it d be it  i have stayed at many outstanding hotels around the world and this one takes the prize  if you can afford a hotel of this caliber it would be a mistake on your part to pass it up  
P => If you MUST have top of the line   OK this hotel is the real deal  I must admit that when I booked this hotel my expectations were high  at the price I was expecting the works  and we got it Our arrival was seamless  got early check in and an instant upgrade with no effort  The room was absolutely a dream  We are extremely observant travelers only stay at the top rated hotels after checking and double checking ratings on multiple sites including this trip advisor site and of course only   star  In our room was fresh fruit and soft music playing  The room was absolutely beautiful the bed was a soft and sweet sleep white down comforter with duvett  I stopped staying at hotels with quotbedspreadsquot years ago  they are so gross  The ble bathroom tv at the vanitysink double head shower and walk in showerbath were absoultely beautiful  There is a flat screen tv dvd with complimentary movies vcr stereo  cordless phones and free wireless internet  do I need to go on The location is ideal  the Watertower is across the street as well as the Ralph Lauren store the American Girl Store and all of the shops and food of Michigan Ave  This is not even the half of what this great hotel has  we went down for a drink at the NoMi lounge  the servicedrinksfood were outstanding  As we wandered back to the room we came across the spagym  unbelievable Im getting a massage in the am after my run  There was a tv on every treadmill and step machine there was complimentary bottled water and glass pitchers of raspberry fresh ice water at  at night cold towels steam room lap pool  Hands down the best hotel in Chicago weve stayed in nearly all of them  family nearby and usually come here at least once every  months  We will never stay at another hotel  I am sad that we have to check out tomorrow  Splurge and try it  I promise youll agree     See you at NoMI 
P => Location Location Yes the P H  Chicago is perfectly located  And the service personnel especially the bell staff housekeeping and in room dining deserve high ks  We were however extremely disappointed that there was absolutely no sign of any orations of the season  It  as well have been mid y in the lobby  Oh pardon my oversight the hotel entrance had a sparse attempt at conveying some semblance of ChristmasHoliday spirit  The Pritzkers should be ashamed  The property located in the block immediately to the south was resplendent in good cheer and glad tidings  Next visit The P H  room was certainly adequate albeit nothing extraordinary  The carpets will need to be replaced soon as there was a tear in our room  The furnitue had the look of nicks and dents that happens with age  And dont believe everything seen on the hotels web site  What doors from the tubbathroom to the bedroom area While we didnt enjoy dining at NoMi the P H s highly lauded restaurant the adjoing bar area was comfortable and well served  Come on Hyatt kick it up a notch or two 
P => Impeccable this hotel is truly the bizzomb there is a reason its number one here  stunning rooms impeccable service and hands down the best location in chicago  they sent up a computer guy to fix my laptop at pm the usher at the door walked up my luggage right up and i was checked in less than  minutes  i wanted a room with a better view    got upgraded without a word to a michigan ave room on a high floor overlooking the watertower  everything is done with a quotyes sir right away sir attitude quot you should definately try nomi for breakfast or dinner    makes you feel like you quotmadequot it  imagine having lobster egg benedict reading the tribune while overlooking the watertower truly unique experience    beats any other place i ve stayed before hands down including the ritz four seasons and the intercontinental  if you can afford it you should      definately     stay there particularly with a significant other  
P => Fit for a queen  but cozy Ritzy  But totally comfortable  In my suite I felt as if no on else existed it was so quiet  The pool was wonderful  The staff very attentive  Well worth every cent and then some  
P => Toilet Closet Huh I think that the reviewer a few reviews down from mine must have been staying at the Pork Hyatt in the slhterhouse district Seriously I travel on business about  weeks a year  This is my second favorite hotel in the world tied with the Grand Hyatt Shanghai and behind the Mandarin Oriental Munich  The Park Hyatt Chicago is a world class hotel outstadning in every way The rooms are very tastefully done  Beds are super comfortable and the sheets pillows bedspreads are very very clean  The bathroom is huge   the bathroom itself is the size of the actual room Ive stayed in at a few hotels in Scandinavia Look to each their own  Live and let live  If you are traveling to Chicago and want a perfect location and an amazing hotel where your needs will be met but no one will bother you this is the spot  
P => A Special Place for a Priceless Trip I took my  year old dhter and my  year old mother to Chicago for an American Girl weekend  The Park Hyatt was chic very comfortable and extremely friendly  I forgot my toothbrush and they brought one up to me along with mouthwash and toothpaste on a silver platter  They were great and their staff is included in my wonderful memory of a very special trip  
P => Wouldnt stay anwhere else What can I say Ive stayed here many times and have never been disappointed  Beds are the most comfortable Ive ever slept in  Staff is always knowledgeable and courteous  Location cant be beat  Price is a bit high but you get what you pay for  Highly recommended  
P => Park Hyatt is Peachy Just returned from a two day seminar at the Parky Hyatt in Chicago  Excellent hotel service food room everything Would stay there again in a new york minute even though its pricy  
P => We loved the Park Hyatt We really loved this hotel  It felt cozy and intimate and subdued  Not bold and flashy  The concierge was very help to my husband and get an anniversary present shipped to the hotel without my knowledge  The staff was very friendly upbeat and warm  The rooms were very nice and just our style  Our views from our window were wonderful of the Lake and the Watertower and the John Hancock building  We were on the th floor in a Grand Deluxe king room over looking Michigan Avenue  The location couldnt have been better  We had drinks at the Signature Room Lounge in the John Hancock Buidling to watch the sunset nothing as beautiful as the Florida Sunsets we have here And the food service and VIEWS from the NOMI Restaurant were great  I dont know why the restaurant doesnt get better press  Its very romantic and breakfast was gorgious sitting at the windows looking at the lake  
P => Awesome Hotel This hotel is truly amazing  First off the location is probably the best in the city  Just blocks from the lake and within close proximity to the best shopping restaurants and recreation The staff is wonderful the only complaint was the concierge seemed a little snooty and attentive  The rooms are amazin  Wonderful tubs and great although a little small showers  The best part of our room was the window weat  A deep seat in front of the large window where both my wife and I could sit for hours and read or watch the city go by The work out facility is easily the best in the city at a hotel  There is a LCD tv at every machine cold towels to relax a wonderful lap pool and spa amenities everywhere robes slippers etc We wish we could have stayed longer 
P => great stay my husband and i just returned from a weekend trip in chicago     we ided to stay at the park hyatt mainly based on reviews from ta and im glad we did  the hotel location is great  we were directly across the street from the water tower one block from neimans and saks and for you american girl lovers you are directly across from the front door  being a mother of two boys i dont understand the american girl phenomenom but families were lined up down the block prior to the store opening so get there early honestly i thought the room would be a little bigger but due to the long hallway and foyer i guess it is larger than a standard hotel room  we had a beautiful view of michigan ave  and the lake the window seat and eames chair are a great touch  the bathroom is great except we couldnt figure out the light switches way to many  loved the davies gate bath products  the staff is very generous  we had continental bkfst  included with our stay or you can apply the cost to bkfst  of your choice  my husband is a southern man so it has to be a full bkfst  the next morning to our surprise the staff gave us  more certificates under our door  it was very very thoughtful  we loved the conceriege on staff both nights they were very accomodating worked to get us dinner res  at the time we suggested without any questions  but most of all we loved the driver ramon  my husband attended a conference at the riot down the street and he was there each morning happy to take my husband so he didnt have to catch a cab  he also was available to transport us to dinner both nights  he was very charming and enjoyable  i highly suggest this hotel you cant go wrong p s  the bed is fabulous 
P => Great Place Rooms are perfect Perfect Place  Rooms are perfect  Very Hip Super clean and ultra modern  Super comfortable bed  Kids are allowed in the indoor pool but its a lap pool and they are allowed in the whirlpool Compared to the Four Seasons   rooms are smaller at the Park Hyatt but updated to the maxYou wont go wrong with the Park Hyatt  
P => star hotel at  star rate Ive stayed at the ritz and the peninsula im telling you this rates right up with both  In some ways i liked this hotel better  NoMI is the best restaurant in chicago  The rooms are beautiful with deep sunken tubs and sliding panels that open from the bathroom into the rest of the room  This along with outstanding service give this hotel true value  This is a five star hotel with four star rates  
P => Modern and Chic I stayed at Park Hyatt with my friend  I felt the Front Desk was not Friendly The Agent who checked me in did not smile or use my last name The room was so beautiful and modern   I love the size of bathroom  The bed in room was so comfortable   Great Hotel and wonderful location  
P => Great Location BUT     Beautiful hotel excellent location great service  But      cell phone reception is awful or non existent we had to go outside at all hours of the day and night and the same is true for wi fi  However if youre here on a romantic getaway and dont WANT to use your cell phone then the Park Hyatt is the place  Ill leave my cell phone and laptop home and stay here again  
P => Deserves the ratings stars This is a well run comfortable place to stay   and an almost second home for multiple business trips to Chicago  The rooms are so nice I have not felt so bad being too tired to venture out  The rooms are quiet and the hotel feels safe and secure  It is nice to be recognized as a returning guest and have staff that is ready willing and able to make accomodations and attend to requests efficiently and sincerely  Although the room service prices are quite pricey the food is great and served nicely  The restaurant for breakfast is a great way to start the day looking out at the Water Tower and the lake beyond  The rooms are spotless and well organized and comfortable for working and relaxing  Great fitness center and nice lap pool     indoor  A five minute walk in any direction leads to great shopping and restaurant options and multiple transportation options from the wonderful hotel driver to public busel or taxi service  I have found a lot of the lower tier Hyatt properties lacking and not keeping up to speed but this property is the best of the brand without exception  
P => The Park Hyatt Chicago   an little piece of heaven The Park Hyatt Chicago is a luxurious hotel situated by the Water Tower on Michigan Avenue  Its right in the middle of the shopping district  The rooms are beautiful  The bath products were fantastic  I loved the soap so much I asked to for a few extras to take home  To my disbelief   housekeeping gave me more than  bars of soap the products are davies gates and typically cost  a bar  The restaurantlounge has good drinks and great food  The service was impeccable and the staff very polite and helpful  This is a must stay  Oh yes    and the beds    they are so comfortable  You feel as if you are floating on a cloud  
P => Very luxurious hotel After treating my mother and father in law to a weekend downtown at the Park Hyatt I can sum the hotel up in one word Impressive  We live in the western suburbs of Chicago and wanted to make a  weekend  of it  I chose this hotel online and made the perfect choice ServiceTop notch  Everyone from the reception desk to bellmen to servers were polite and very gracious  They treat you like youre a king Check inWe arrived for our pm check in at  and our room wasn t ready yet  We checked our bags with the bellmen and walked down Rush street to ide where to eat dinner while we waited  I got a call on my cell phone at  letting me know the room was ready  This was a long wait for our room but didn t bother us because there was lots of sightseeing  They seemed sincerely sorry we had to wait so long too LocationTHIS is what you re paying the big bucks for This hotel is prime  It is smack on Michigan avenue kiddie corner from Watertower place You can walk a few blocks and swim at Oak Street beach visit the Hancock building catch a bus to navy pier or just walk around and take in the sights  Rush street in on the other side of this hotel so you have access to plenty of great restaurants   all of which you can walk to AmenitiesThis hotel has the most fabulous workout facility I ve seen  Wonderful equipment in a setting that even tempts couch potatoes to work out The th floor gym has glass windows that look out over the city and the hotel s indoor lap pool  There are complimentary bottles of water and towels everywhere  The bathrooms have toothbrushes toothpaste mouthwash lotions shower caps the works  You almost don t even need to PACK if you re staying here There are even candles burning in the ladies room for ambienceRoomsThe good size rooms do not look like  hotel  rooms at all  They look like orator showrooms  Beds have white feather top bedding and feather pillows  The bathrooms have lovely soaps lotions candles etc  There is potpourri in bowls in baths on the desk even by the elevators in the hall But the view is to die for  We looked out over the lake and could watch the people strolling on Michigan avenue Final noteWe took a boat ride on Saturday night and it was pointed out during the tour that Oprah owns the top penthouse in this hotel  I can see why  
P => Best Place to Stay in Chicago I just returned from my th stay at this fabulous hotel  Having stayed at several hotels on Michigan Ave  this one is tops You just cant beat the location atmosphere wonderful staff amp impeccable service not to mention that the room amp bathroom sizes are one of the largest for a downtown hotel  The location is great   shopping amp restaurants are all within easy walking distance plus the hotel reastauantlounge   NoMI is excellent  Staying at the Park Hyatt although located in a hub of activity is a relaxing amp serene experience  
P => Unbelievable Had a long weekend at the Park Hyatt   with my wife  To start the hotel and rooms smell great thanks to kiwi potpourri  Check in is a breeze and they apologized because I had to wait  seconds  The rooms are beautiful large modern and clean with an amazing bathroom  The health club and pool are top of the line and the service is unmatched anywhere  Food at Nomi is terrific though the portions are somewhat small  Their location is perfect for all activites  What a great weekend  
P => Fantastic This is the place to choose if you travel to Chicago  Suberb bedroom with huge window bathroom is like a private spa  The sound system as well as the tv is out of this world  The staff is very nice and attentive to details  Just to sum up The best hotel in Chicago 
P => Wow Wow Wow You have to stay at this hotel Especially if you are visiting the American Girl Doll store  I just returned from a weekend getaway at the Park Hyatt ch th th  We stayed in their standard room and let me tell you there was nothing standard about it  Everything was top of the line  Top shelf bottled water and fresh fruit awaited us upon arrival the room was immaculate flat screen t v s with free movies in the bedroom and the bathroom  The bathroom was like having our own personal spa  Complimentary sea saltsloofah and scented candles were just the beginning  We were worried about the room because we usually stay in a suite but we booked last minute and this was all they had available  I was so suprised and pleased The room had huge windows with window seats over looking Michigan Ave  They even had a present from the doll store for each of my dhters sitting on the window seat when we arrived and specialty cookies and milk for them before bedtime all complimentary We left in the evening to go to dinner and when we returned they had  doll beds awaiting my little girls dolls and slippers and robes set out for us  The beds were heaven  I have stayed in some of the nicest hotels in Chicago and their beds cannot compare  I could go on for days on how great our stay was Strange for me because I am very picky about where we stay  If youre big on service come here its the best service I have ever received in Chicago  The breakfast at Nomi was very good  Ive been to the Ritz Drake and Peninsula and the Park Hyatt has been my most memorable experience 
P => The Best of the Best As a travel agent we hear and see the best and the worst and I have to say this is the Best Hotel I have ever stayed in  THe room was amazing  It overlooked the Water Tower and Lake Michigan  We were greeted quickly and up at our room within minutes of getting out of our car  We had drove over  hours from Minnesota  Our Bellman was informational and asked if we needed any further assistance and made us feel right at home  The room was large with the beds being very comfortable  Now for even the better part the Bathroom was as large as my kitchen at home  It had a large deep tub and arate toliet and arate shower  I cannot say enough about this hotel except it is worth every penny  
P => This is why this hotel is Park Hyatts flagship We have stayed at many Park Hyatt properties in the past and were very impressed with the Park Hyatt Chicago when we stayed at it for a weekend getaway  There is a reason why the Hyatt company calls the Chicago Park Hyatt their quotflagshipquot Park Hyatt and it is obvious to anybody who steps into this hotel  The hotel is centrally located on N  Michigan Avenue across from the Water Tower and within walking or  min taxi distance of all that you would want to do in downtown Chicago  On entering the hotel lobby you feel like youve been transported into another world  The staff is extremely gracious and inviting and the interior screams  star quality  The rooms are exceptional even by Park Hyatt standards  Spacious clean wonderful amenities LCD TVs luxurious bathroom beds you will not want to get out of    in a word perfect  The hotels flagship restaurant NoMi has a wonderful brunch menu  Dinner at NoMi meets or exceeds the high standards you would expect at any top tier fine restaurant in Chicago  We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family and think that it is definitely worth the  star price  
P => Best rooms and Location I have been fortunate to travel extensively in the U S  on a fairly generous expense account and Ive had a chance to stay in many of the best hotels in the country  Overall Id have to say that the Park Hyatt Chicago is as fine as any city hotel in the U S  We live just outside Chicago and when we want a city getaway the Park Hyatt is the only game in town The highlightsLOCATION Its the best in the city across the street from the Water Tower and the John Hancock Tower central to all the north Michigan avenue and Oak Street shopping and directly opposite American Girl place  To be fair the Ritz the Four Seasons and the Peninsula are all in the neighborhood too ROOMS This is a pretty new hotel so the rooms were designed with modern touches in mind giant bathrooms with oversized tubs and an LCD TV a long hallway arating the sleeping area from the corridors a great padded window seat overlooking Michigan Avenue and the lake Eames chairs in every room Sony Flat screen TVs with a home theater receiver and a DVDCD player  all the toys  The or is simple modern and elegant and is to my mind just right not as severe and self consciously quothipquot as a W or most of the modern boutique hotels but not as silly as the attempts of a newly built Ritz Carlton to look old and fancy  Michigan Avenue can be noisy so you  want to get a high floor  The standard rooms here are the nicest around PUBLIC SPACES These too are in a restrained modern style  Very nice but not over the top  Its a fairly small hotel so the lobby the library sitting area etc  are not huge  The rooms are so nice though that theres not much point to hanging out in the lobby  The spa locker rooms and pool are all also top notch but not large  Last week my wife and I had the whole pool and jacuzzi to ourselves at  a m on a SundaySERVICEquot We have stayed there with our dhters  and  and without  We were made to feel very welcome either way  We made no extraordinary demands on the hotle staff but received very good service whenever we dealt with the staff PRICE We have always been able to get a room here for  to  and often an upgrade to a suite or a deluxe eastern facing room  Why pay another hundred or more for the Peninsula or Ritz 
P => Park Hyatt I spent three different weekends at the Park Hyatt in ember and ember of   It was by far the best hotel in Chicago that I have stayed in  The staff is very friendly and attentive  I stayed in the Lake Suite and it was breathtaking  The view of the lake as well as part of the magnificent mile was wonderful  The bedroon had a large HDTV on the wall and there was a small one in the bathroom  The living room and kitchen were beautifully orated  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants class along with comfort  
P => Make this one your Chicago destination  
P => A Guaranteed Approval  
P => My Best Hotel Experience in Chicago  
P => Luxury and service await  
P => What a Great Hotel  
P => This is my favorite hotel  
P => A great getaway  
P =>   
P =>   
P => 
P => The reason we stayed another night Do not believe the other reviews  This was a great hotel and the staff was amazing and friendly  They were so nice and hospitable that we stayed an extra night The room was huge and very well kept  The barrestaurant had an amazing variety of well prepared food Again do not believe the bad reviews  Go there and see for yourself  You will not regret it 
P => Great athon Hosts With the help of the staff we were able to enjoy a great athon weekend at an affordable rate  The treated all to a  a m  free continental breakfast and allowed us a late checkout after the race  Free parking fridge and mic in the room at our request and lots of help at the front desk with directions  give that Angie a raise 
P => The staff here made our first totally  tourist  visit to Chicago very pleasant   We have both been to Chicago several times on business but never had a chance to really see the city  The staff at the Ramada Inn Lake Shore made the trip easy and pleasant  They were very helpful and answered all of our questions  The hotel itself is clean and neat with a very nice restaurant and lounge just across the parking lot  The Friday night seafood buffet with a live jazz band was great  
P => My Dhters Wedding was a great success here with only  weeks to plan  After having to change the location of our Dhters Wedding Reception four weeks before the wedding with the help of Earl Adams Director of Sales he and the staff of Ramada made my Dhter and now Son in Laws wedding a beautiful event  From the Food to the finest details  thank you  
P => Sometimes its the housekeepers fault  Ive seen the reviews  I can no longer speak about the main building only because they no longer allow smoking in that part of the hotel and we are now put in the rooms on the side  my husband is a smoker THey have redone their lobby and it looks nice  Theyve added an office space for internet usage and a very nice exercise facility Of course they are trying to update but Im sure its expensive to take care of all that needs to be done so I can appreciate the small steps here and there  In this case though the housekeeping staff are the guilty ones for not reporting room issues It  be an older room and all but there is no reason for the shower curtain rod to be loose from the wall  Housekeeping should report this so it can be repaired before the next guest checks in THe coffee pot my bad since I didnt realize it should have a lid  I told my husband it was clogged and he went to pull out the filter part to unclog and all the hot water burned his fingers    I guess we needed the pot lid to hold a lever in order for the coffee to automatically drip out  Afterward we made coffee again and held the part with a pen so it would drip out  Housekeepings fault again because they are to check that everything in the room is working and there The coffee maker outlet was not working  I tried the reset button and no luck so we had to move rthe maker to another outlet to get it to work   But to their defense on this if no one has told the hotel the outlet is not working then they cant fix it so now that Ive told them hopefully they will look into that for the next guest  Yes I reported the shower curtain rod right away only because I did not want to be blamed for it being broken I did leave a comment card in regards to everything else My fellow roomates on the other side of the hall were a bit noisy if you know what I mean but once we were in the room and turned on the TV we did not hear them after that except the doors shutting kind of hard from time to time All in all yes Ill stay here again  I think the cost is high for the room but as far as the rooms compared to other hotels in the area this is one of the lowest THey always seem to be busy which is a good sign as well THe night of my stay the frontdesk recommended a pizza place and this was the best pizza and philly steak Ive ever had  THe name had Cafe in it so if you stay here definatly ask about this place Ive learned from tripadvisor that every guest looks at things diferrently and you have to just take the good with the bad and hope for the best  Could this place be better yes it could but if it was toatlly   percent perfect in every way youd be paying much more  
P => You cant get there from here I chose this hotel since we were driving and it offered free parking in a downtown location  This hotel is not downtown It doesnt look far on a map but to get anywhere you have to drive take a shuttle or a series of buses and trains  It is located on Lakeshore drive but without good directions it is almost impossible to get to the little side street to the entrance  The desk staff was very friendly and the shuttle driver was great  I took the shuttle twice to the Field Museum and the Art Institute  Its about  blocks to a bus stop not bad but id you turn the wrong way you can end up in a very sketchy neighborhood very quickly About the room  when we checked in I found someones dirty underclothes hanging in the bathroom and used soap in the tub and a lot of mold  Yuck After calling the desk they still had not come to pick them up by the next morning so I put them out in the hall  When my teen aged son woke up the next day he found a camisole and thong made up in the bed  He thought it was funny but I was a little grossed out  The security door was broken and slammed repeatedly as people entered and exited  We had a lovely view of the parking lot  They advertise free wifi but it is only available in the lobby  This hotel needs a refurbish  Its old and it shows  Ive stayed in worse but next time I will spend a little more for a better location 
P => Pleasant clean and convenient hotel in Hyde Park Pleasant clean quiet well managed safe and convenient hotel  Free parking  Close to restaurants and services of Hyde Park and University of Chicago  Convenient in and out of downtown Chicago  Reasonably priced  Contrary to what some people have written this is a nice no frills hotel  It doesnt pretend to be a  star hotel in downtown Chicago  I had a very pleasant experience here  
P => How Pleasant Doing business in Chicago I always select this hotel as it is close enough to drive downtown in a few minutes and far enough to be out of the crazy congestion of downtown  What I love about this hotel is the friendly staff and terrific restaurant  Great food and prices and I just walk there  They have free parking try that downtown  
P => Convenient to UChicago but dont count on internet access The hotel appears to have done some updating and it is better than the past  Problem is they advertise free wireless but if you are NOT in the main part of the hotel you can access the wireless  so it makes it hard for a business traveler to get things done unless they want to sit in the lobby  That is just annoying  Itis easily accessible to the University of Chicago but next time I will probably stay out by Midway Airport so I can access the internet from my room  The Fitness Center is minimal as is the business center  
P => A NIGHTE    if I could have slept We stayed at the Ramada Lakeshore for  exhausting nights in early il  My sister lives in Hyde Park and this hotel is the only game in town in that part of Chicago but honestly I would rather sleep in a   parking lot than stay there again  We had stayed there before and it was never that satisfactory but this time was by far the worst There are a few positives    it is convenient to the UofC and Its fairly easy to get downtown by car or the train  The staff was for the most part very kind and accomodating and the beds were actually not horribly uncomfortable  The shower was fine and the suite we had was quite large But thats where the positives end  The rooms themselves are tattered and smelly  Ceiling tiles are falling paint is chipped mirrors are cracked and towels are rough  There was wireless internet but it was very slow and spotty  Totally undependable  But all of that would be almost acceptable at the low rates the Ramada charges if not for the NOISE Yes NOISE which drove me to the point of insanity  The walls are paper thin and one can hear EVERYTHING  Not only in the rooms next door but also in the rooms above and below  Every scream yell moan and groan belch and scratch  EVERYTHING And all of this dare I say at    and  AM  Night after night In room after room  Yes we slept in FOUR rooms during our six night stay changing rooms in the middle of the night  And in each one we were treated to a show of loud parties yelling fighting screaming and endless F Us  Over and over and over I am not a particularly light sleeper but this was too much Each time we called the front desk security tried to stop the noise but to little avail  Once when security knocked on the door of a room below we could hear a loud      YOUquot in reply  Nice After  nights at the Ramada we vowed never to return  Even if the room as free  Nice people  And cheap  But a horrible place  Dont waste your time there  
P => The warmest hotel in a chilly city My first visit to the Windy City in the middle of winter and it really was cold So I was glad to be staying at the extremely warm and friendly Ramada Inn Lake Shore where the staff was the friendliest and most helpful Ive ever experienced  Lovely rooms clean and beautiful and perfect location near UChicago  And the price was excellent This stay was absolutely TERRIFIC Five stars to these friendly folks 
P => Dogs are allowed     but so are prostitutes We stayed here for the International Kennel Club Dog Show  The hotel is less than  minutes from McCormick Place and that is its best feature  The lobby was nice and the staff was friendly but the hallways had a lot of wear and tear the elevator broke down on Sunday and the room had a funny smell  There was no clock radio presumably because it had been stolen TV and refrigerator were quite dated but worked On Sunday at about  a m  we encountered two prostitutes on their way home from a night of quotin house quot Yes thats what they told us They had been doing business out of a room on our floor Fortunately it was not noisy     but yikes 
P => 	 WARNING       This building was the first stop on a two week road trip  We expected hotel to be average clean and nothing too special  However we got a poor reception and shocking rooms  We had rooms with electrical and plumbing hazards  The rooms were s  The beds were comfortable thats about it  Theres no pubs or restaurants near the place  Only stay here if its the only room left in Chicago  The owners need to spend a lot of money on it the place gave us the shivers          
P => Staff was super The staff was superb  My friend and I had such a good time because management took care of everything  Angela at the front desk was so helpful The shuttle driver also was very personable and knowledgeable  Good people 
P => Substandard We reserved this hotel online based on the Hyde Park location  It is in a neighborhood of beautiful high rise buildings next to the Lake  However the facility is in terrible condition the paint is peeling the carpet is dirty and smells it has outdated oration and stainedpeeling wallpaper After one night we checked out and moved to the Chicago South Loop hotel  What a relief to be out of thereI cannot believe that a respected well known hotel chain like Ramada would permit a hotel to be operated in that condition We saw a piece of wallpaper peeled back next to an elevatorand there was a hole all the way throughSecurity At night they station two armed guards in the lobbyDo yourself a favor and pass on this place    
P => Out of town but          Stayed here with my girlfriend for  nights in e  We found the hotel nice clean and with the convenience of free Wifi and a restaurant The room was clean and a good size although a bit dated We visited Chicago to do some sight seeing and unfortunately the hotel is quite a way out from Downtown so if youre looking to stay close to the attractionsshopsrestaurants etc  then I wouldnt advise staying here About a ten minute walk away is a few places to eat laundry and shops which we found useful The restaurant next door which is part of the hotel was very nice  We sat down to eat late and so didnt expect a lot but we were pleasantly surprised at both the quality of food and service Overall a nice stay but not a great location  
P => This Hotel Is Just Fine We needed a room for a couple of days while a family member was at U of C hospital  This hotel is one that offers a discount to U of C patients  We were hesitant to stay here because of the reviews but because the locations was so ideal we took the chance We are so glad we took the chance  The room was clean including the bedding bathroom and carpet  The staff were all friendly  We felt the neighborhood was fine  We never felt afraid  The only things we didnt care for were the elevator inspected and the smell of the hallway  The room did not smell bad There is a taxi stop directly outside the hotel but if you choose to drive yourself the front desk is more than happy to give you a map with specific instructions on the best way to get somewhere  In fact the front desk was alway more than happy to help answer our questions and we had several I took my laptop and had no problem receiving a wireless signal in our room on the rd floor  The restaurantlounge was a nice place to sit back and relax  We will be staying here again soon  I recommend giving it a try if you arent too picky of a person  If you want a   star room I suggest driving downtown and paying for the   star room  This hotel is not a diamond at a cubic zirconia price it is just a plan e  star hotel  
P => Wonderful Stay The Staff at the Ramada Lake Shore made the stay very enjoyable  Angie at the front desk was very helpful with directions on how to get to different locations thorughout Chicago  The rooms were very clean and comfortable  
P => Good location at reasonable price The Ramada Lake Shore is a great compromise between staying in town and getting a reasonable room rate  There has been some remodeling work going on during our stay but this didnt make the stay uncomfortable  The personal has been friendly  The Restaurant in the conference building belonging to the hotel is great  Friday nights buffet w Jazz is highly recommended a lot of fun and great dinner for around   CTA bus no   is an easy way to get to the museums and into town within just a few minutes  We will certainly stay at the Ramada again 
P => nice view The good things about our stay were we found the staff to be pleasantthe bathroom was cleanbed was comfortable with clean sheetsand had a great view of the lake The bad things were the tv had a terrible picture that couldnt be adjustedthe bed pillows were too thinthe fridge didnt work and the coffeemaker made coffee so weak it looked like weak teaand only managed to spew out  very small portions  I must say we ate at the restaurant there and had a wonderfully delicious meal Also must add I would stay there again because a clean bathroom and a comfortable clean bed are the most important things to me in a hotel  
P => Great Price Great Location Had a work engagement in Chicago for a couple of days during two different weeks  Im dont generally chose  star elegance and service at high prices Working on the Soutside of Chicago and wanted a reasonably priced place with high speed internet and free parking  Mapped the work location on Google and searched nearby hotels and found this Ramada  Restaurant room service a plus  Covered parking in Chicago in winter is a great perk  Self serv parking elsewhere in Chicago is  per night The first stay in the last week of ruary I had a room about  yards from Lake Michigan and with a view of the south side of Downtown Chicago  Nice comfortable clean with a coffee maker fridge and comfortable bed  Ordered room service one night and had a good  oz  Ribeye for   Only bad part of the stay was the internet not working After confirming that the internet was working I booked two days the next week  Internet was working as I am writing this from the room  When I checked in Angie the frint desk staff welcomed me back  The room I was first assigned was not adequate  The TV remote did not work even after replaing the batteries and the fridge was not working  Called the front desk and Angie immediately reassigned me a large room with a working remote fridge and a microwave  The room was not a suite but was huge  The view was not on the lake but in a big city the view of the tall building is always spectacular My sone lives in Chicago and when visiting him we have payed much more for less than here oven on Priceline  I will book a room at this hotel again  
P => Pefectly fine for the price Hey people when you book a hotel that costs half what the Hilton charges youre not going to get the Hilton It was perfectly fine for the price and location    room was clean everything worked even the TV remote hot water was steady  The major problem was that the only working ice machine was on the th floor  Whoop de doo  Will stay there again in fact I already booked it for next month  
P => Felt Gyped at the Ramada Inn Lakeshore drive Chicago Lets start off with  good points about the hotel  It has working internet access like it says it does  Secondly there if you are lucky you  get a room with a great view of Lake Michigan across the highway from you  I guess a rd plus is that we saw no roaches Now for the real  This spot is run down and when I say run down I do mean run down to the point of neglect  I dont know when last the vents were cleaned but they were so dusty that it looked like grey cauliflower coming through the grate The hall carpet is filthy  It is akin to walking through a back alley behind a butchers shop  Who konws what ran off into it but it is sticky The property has a laundry list of things that need to be fixed that is too long to detail on  floors only  ice machines only  of which was working broken windows in rooms fixed with a bit of clear tape air conditioners that do not work holes slammed in sheetrock everywhere      The list continues for many more paragraphs Parking too is a bit of a joke  Though not as bad as some places having to fight with locals who parked across the entrance to the hotel to watch y th fireworks and parked in the Guests only parking then came in to tell the manager they were gonna block him in for a minute while my wife amp I cruised the roads around trying to get into the hotel lot        Oh cable tv didnt work and at first neither did the phone  They tried to get me to fix it over the phone  I called on my cell phone and I had to tell them to just send the phone guy unless they were going to pay me      Best of luck staying there  Forewarned is forearmed  
P => Excellent Bargain in Chicago I booked this hotel because the price was so low     per night  I didnt read any reviews until shortly before we left and I then got very nervous because most of them were pretty negative  But the hotels in the center of Chicago where all the tourist attractions are were simply unaffordable for us so we proceeded to stay at the Ramada  Im happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by our experience  All in all for the price this choice was fine  We knew upfront that there was no free shuttle service between the airports and the hotel  It costs about   to get from the airport to the city unless you use the train or bus  We chose to use a cab for our return to OHare and the Omega Shuttle upon our arrival  Omega goes between the airports and the south side The accomodations themselves The bed was comfortable the bathroom was newly reated and the shower was the best Ive ever used anywhere  The room appeared to be as clean as any hotel I have stayed in and we were resupplied with fresh towels every day  The TV included HBO and Showtime although the reception for Showtime never did work  As well most of the cable stations were full of quotsnowquot and difficult to watch The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  It was unseasonably warm in Chicago and it took a day to get the air conditioning on again but they did respond to our request  The hotel itself is a bit rundown but if youre really there to see the city its fine  There is a taxi stand right there so you can always get a cab  And the bus stop is about two blocks away  The neighborhood felt safe to me  We took the bus most days using a three day visitor pass that cost   per person unlimited use  Ramada does have a free shuttle that will take you downtown and pick you up daily if you want to visit the attractions there  We didnt use it because were early birds and wanted to get going very early every day  The biggest surprise to me was how good their restaurant was  The only complaint I had was that the vegetables were the same almost every night and were not seasoned properly  But everything else was delicious  Their breakfast buffet was superb and the wait staff was very polite and helpful All in all this hotel is a terrific bargain for Chicago  I would definitely stay there again  
P => nice place to stay I stayed in Ramada Lake Shore for  week  The room was generally clean and well maintained  Room service was good  Reception was also nice  They might not act as eager as you expected for  star hotels but thats not what you can expect from this hotel  The hotels in Chicago are really expensive  For this kind of price Ramada is considered a good choice  The connection to downtown depends on Taxi or Metra Electric Railway  Taxi to McCormick Place is about  min and costs approximately USD  Metra Electric runs more frequently around  oclock  The th Street and the th street stations are equally far from Ramada  Its takes about min to walk there  Id suggest the th street since the way to it seems easier  Some trains do not stop at the th street station Internet connection is a real problem  It is unstable and seems relatively slow  Those live in the  floor building might not be able to use it  Sometimes connection can be established at around the window at certain angle  If you have an external antenna it might be easier  Thats why sometimes you can see people taking their notebook to lobby  Suggestions to the hotel improve the internet connection and place a brochure in room about the amenities and house rules  
P => Not Impressed Expected more from the description  Hotel needs to be updated  Telephone did not work and staff seemed uninterested in alleviating the problem  Shuttle runs on a tight schedule unlike what is described in the Hotel directory  Hallways smelled of aying carpets  Could hear the neighbors conversation at  a m  through the vent in the bathroom  But the rooms were kept very clean and there is a great view of Lake Michigan  
P => Great for the neighborhood but not much else We stayed at the Ramada hotel for a week and overall it was an okay experience  The best part about the hotel was its location in Hyde Park  Kenwood with a number of great shops and restaurants within a   minute walk  We never used the hotel s shuttle service to get around and instead walked  minutes to the CTA bus stop at E  Hyde Park and Cornell where we were able to catch the   bus and get downtown whenever it was most convenient for us as opposed to being limited to the operational hours of the shuttle bus  The restaurant at the hotel was also very nice and we received extremely exceptional service during the times that we ate our meals there The quality of the room itself however was lacking  One of the closet doors was broken and simply propped up against the other working one the hallways frequently had a less than pleasing smell to them at all hours of the day and on the morning we checked out I saw a small worm crawling on my bed and needless to say got out of there asap  I m glad that it happened the day we left as neither of us wanted to spend another minute in that room after seeing it and thinking about what else might have been lurking somewhere You get what you pay for I suppose so the next time we visit Chicago we ll definitely look into staying at a better hotel  Even with the additional cost itll definitely be worth having a room of a much better quality  
P => Dont Book This One This hotel was nothing like it shows in pictures Stinky hallways will ruin your vacation  Never book this hotel through eleisurelink   the reps will tell you its walking distance from downtown Dont spoil your vacation staying here  More info email me at sdilon yahoo com 
P => OK for what it is but not a place to stay for pleasure  We stayed at the Ramada while visiting family and visiting colleges  We really only used the site for sleeping as we were very busy  I think the Ramada is the only choice if you need to stay near the University of Chicago as we did The rooms were clean and comfortable Breakfast service was fast and good if pricey for the value  The rooms were clean and comfortable  no complaints there although again the price was high for the value received Wireless was only available in the hotel lobby which is a rather small and cheerless place I would not stay here again unless I had to stay near Hyde Park or the University of Chicago  If you are going to visit Chicago for pleasure find a different lodging  
P => Very happy with Ramada Inn I stayed in the Lake Shore Drive Ramada over Thanksgiving  Was coming home from London for the holiday and it was the only only hotel I could get into in Hyde Park where my family lives  I had read the other reviews and was a little anxious as I was bringing along a first time Chicago visitor and didnt want him to be disappointed  We were both very happy with the hotel in general and our room  The room must have been one of the recently reated ones  It was nicely orated and very comfortable  We had a huge bed a lake view with a great view of the Chicago skyline a coffee maker and fridge and a fab bathroom  All the staff at the desk the cleaners in the restaurant for breakfast were very pleasant and helpful  It was really convenient having hotel parking right there being so close to the train downtown and being right across the Drive from the lake for morning walks  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will probably be coming back to the Ramada for the next few Thanksgivings  
P => Two Motels This is a motel in the old fasioned sense where you can park for free and easily get to your car  There are two buildigs to stay in  One is  stories high with an elevator and one is across a  foot wide parking lot and is a two story long rectangular building  It is much nicer to stay in the main building with easy access to the desk and vending machines and free web access  You tend to get a little isolated in the other building  It is great if you have business in Hyde Park and are trying to conserve costs  The main building has been reated and was very comfortable  I liked being able to just go out and get in my car and go rather than have to wait for it to be retrieved from a lot  I have the feeling that since I stayed after it was reated it was a much nicer experience than those who stayed before the reation  
P => Not Worth  a night I stayed at this hotel with a co worker over a weekend in Chicago while we attended a continuing eduation course   I picked this hotel ONLY for the free parking  That was the only plus    like so many reviewers have said before me  Our room  smelled of mildew the TV remote did not work and the room itself was much too small for all of the furniture quotstuffedquot into it  The ONLY ice machine is on the rd floor of the main building   and there are  buildings of this hotel arated by parking lots  We had to walk outside our building across the parking lot and up the elevator in the main building for ice  There is no fitness room on site and Im a fitness enthusiast  The guy at the front desk gave me directions to the Bally fitness club quotONLY  BLOCKS AWAYquot and assured me I could walk there easily and safely  Hah The reality was the club was almost exactly a miles walk away and along a highway with no sidewalks    and not exactly a safe neighborhood for a young white female to be travieling solo  This place is no better than your cheapest motel   WAY OVERPRICED     a definite rip off  
P => Needs reating but serviceable for short business stay In Chicago on business I stayed here as it was closest to client  The hotel needs work for sure and if youre finicky about every detail you will find plenty here to turn you off  old slow elevator spots of peeling wallpaper banged up moldings aged furnishings electrical tape on the remote control  But the room was huge and everything worked so for  it was serviceable for one night  The on site restaurant was surprisingly good The staff was cheerful and helpful  The alarm clock was going off in the room next to mine and the beeping was clearly audible in my room  On my way to eat I told the clerk at the desk  He rang the room but obviously the guests were out or unconscious  When I came back through lobby  min later the clerk told me he had gone up to the room and turned off the alarm  
P => A very good value My visit to Hyde Park was y    amp this hotel was the most convenient to my location  The staff was cheerful the room was clean the bed was excellent the bathroom had good lighting and the room was non smoking as I had requested  My only issues were with a broken drapery cord I had to close the draperies by hand and the low height about   ft  of the shower head holder it was mounted to accommodate a disabled  senior guest sitting on the provided bench  Both problems were minor  The room was very large   even with a king size bed   and included a small refrigerator microwave oven a round table  chairs coffee pot and hair dryer The hotel is on Lakeshore Drive  Lake Michagan with its extensive lake front park is just across the street   a great space for walking and getting outdoors I will stay here again  
P => You get what you pay for My sisters family and my family both stayed here in arate rooms  We were charged the same but my sister got the room with the lakeview refrigerator and microwave  The bathroom had recently been remodeled so it was clean   thankfully The best part of the hotel was the free parking and the friendly helpful staff at the front desk  They were very knowledgable about the area  Also the drive to the museums navy pier and aquarium was short and easy  There werent any extra pillows or towels  Bring your own  Remember that this is a  star hotel and that is what you will get  Nothing matches  Smelly hallways and rooms  Old air conditioner that couldnt keep up with the  degree heatwave that Chicago was having during our stay  Pool was dirty as the water level was about a foot below the skimmer  I will not stay here again  Not recommended for families  Could be a very nice hotel with some extensive remodeling and updating  
P => Stayed here the night before the Chicago athon  
P => Nothing short of a dump  
P => Hated it  
P => Dont go here  
P => Never again  
P => Wonderful Service  
P => Acceptable  
P => 
P => a much needed relaxing stay Good hotel service starts at check in and the front desk agents at the Red Roof are always so friendly They made sure we had the things we needed for the night and greeted us everytime we walked past the desk  Our room was cozy and very clean  The comlimentary coffee in our room was perfect in the morning  Ill definitely stay there again soon  
P => lip service to roaches and bugs My wife and I had stayed at the RRI on a previous visit and I felt OK booking her and a friend there again  Unfortunately her room had cockroaches other bugs and other cleanliness issues  A complaint brought an apology and excuses from the GM but nothing else  A free night or a reduction in rate would certainly have been appropriate In her note the GM says quotI realize we have lost your businessquot  How right she is  
P => Great location for the budget traveller This hotel had some dodgy recent reviews so I was pleasantly surprised at the friendly and helpful staff  Bedrooms were a trifle small but this room on floor  seemed in good orative order and bathroom was bright and clean  Theres a safe in the room for your valuables hair dryer iron and in room coffee maker  Its well situated for the Michigan Avenues Magnificent Mile and an easy walk to Navy Pier the river Water Tower the El and shopping  Some tasty and inexpensive eateries Burrito on the Beach are nearby  Id gladly stay here again  
P => Red roof inn is very near and walkable to all chicago attractions Red roof inn is very near and walkable to all chicago attractionsbut for parking stay in redroof inn was very cost effective  
P => Perfect My wife and I stayed for one night and we were very skeptical after reading the reviews however the hotel served us perfectly  The staff was very friendly and the location was awesome  The room was small but certainly adequate and it was clean  The bathroom was just fine  The flat screen TV was a nice amenity and the bed was comfortable  Hey we only paid night through priceline and you cant beat that  I would stay there again in a heartbeat  
P => You get what you pay for  Nothing I ided to take a weekend trip with a friend to Chicago  After searching through many hotels I ided upon the Red Roof Inn because of the location and the cheap price  I should have known that the cheaper the price the cheaper the service  Upon arrival the desk clerk took my credit card and ID and started the paperwork  However she kept answering the phones and it took nearly  minutes just to get our room keys  When we entered our room the air conditioning was broken  We called the Front Desk and they said they would send a maintenance man up to fix it  After  more calls to the desk in an hour and a half period she offered to switch our rooms  The other room was smaller and had a broken light  The maid didnt even clean our room the next day until after pm My parents stayed at the Best Western and only paid  dollars more  Next time Ill ante up the money and stay at a place that is deserving of my business  
P => Red Roof Inn Downtown Chicago The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that they do not tell you how expensive the parking is   As a first time visitor to Chicago I did not know the parking situation When I booked a room here they never told me   they probaly assumed I knew    That parking was an extra  a day   I was on a budgetand that blew my budget all to hell Beware that parking is alot extra   the hotel its self was fine   my room was a bit small but what the heck do you expect for one of the cheapest nights stay in Chicago   It was clean and comfortable   Staff was very friendly and one valet recommended and excellnt place to eat dinner that was under  for the entre  
P => Spend the extra money and stay somewhere much nicer  I stayed at hotel e    though the location of the hotel is perfect the hotel amp service itself is less then that  Upon checking in I was put into a room that was dirty and had spider webs in the in the windows and was the size of a closet yes its a downtown property I accepted that the cleanliness however was not acceptable I called down to the desk to see about switching rooms and was told I was in the largest room they didnt offer to move me until I asked for a refund to move elsewhere  I was put in a much nicer room  This seemed to be partly remodeled  The day of check out a person who was in the room with me dropped their phone between the bed and wall went to pick it up and found old dried up vomit on the wall floor and side of the bed  At check out i brought it to the ladies attention and was simply asked if I would like another copy of my bill  I ided that when I got home I would call the manager  Manager was nice apologized and offered to refund my money  Long story short it has been about TWO months and due to lake of competence and just plan disregard with the extent of this issue I am STILL waiting for my refund  The customer service is seriously lacking I have gone through  different people promising my refund none of which have actually followed through  I would advise you spend the extra money and stay in a much cleaner hotel to avoid any situation of this matter  
P => Perfect for TeenCollege Students This hotel is in a perfect location downtown  The cleanliness wasnt the best but if youre going to Chicago for the city and not for the hotel its definately worth it  The cleanliness mentioned in other reviews was not experienced during our stay  We had a blast in chicago and the Red Roof Inn provided a great nights sleep for us  
P => Good price for the area  The service and cleanliness were not so good  We couldnt have asked for a better location for the money  That said I travel quite a bit with my job and the Red Roof Inn on Ontario is one of the worst hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in  When we arrived the air conditioner in the room did not work  I called the front desk to get something done about it  The girl at the front desk assured me that it would be taken care of  It wasnt  We didnt press the issue because the weather was mild during the week we were there  The room was not altogether clean  There were dirty q tips a face cleaning pad and a wad of toilet paper in our ice bucket when we arrived  They stayed with us all week  I would only recommend this hotel to someone if they are willing to sacrifice customer service and cleanliness for a cheap room in an excellent location  
P => Phenomenal value in prime Chicago location  I booked through Red Roofs site some promotional rate they had  I had a hard time figuring out where in Chicago the hotels were as I wanted to be near certain addresses  Asking a native for the name of the neighborhoods as well as spotting some hotels helped  The hotel on E  Ontario is a great location  Checking in was ominous Two young people were at the desk and the young lady did not stop her personal conversation the whole time she checked me in  She filled out a document while commenting on the pregnancy of an acquaintance and the other clerk gossiped with her about it while I stood completely ignored  Not a query not a question not a how are you  How I hate this kind of receptionThe bell man was very attentive  The room was oddly shaped but large in comparison to a NYC hotel of three times the cost  The room was clean the bed comfortable and the room had a microwave and fridge  The bathroom was a comfortable size  Ironing board adequate closet area space large TV  Hairdryer but no fancy giveaways but that is fine  The floor was populated by young folk from Europe  One time in the elevator two maids were very friendly and real and expressed their hope that my room was all right  That was surprising and nice  The bell man helping me out with luggage was great and I had to push a tip on him Id stay there again because of its location  be next time Ill interrupt the clerks and ask them to pay attention to me I was on floor  The information on parking was accurate and told me that in no way did I want to use their parking arrangement  I appreciate the candor amp made other arrangements  I tried to use the wifi and when it failed I did not have time to mess with it  Im not sure they have it I  have been picking up a signal from a building nearby  
P => The good news is they let us leave    On a recent business turned leisure trip to Chicago my boyfriend and I were booked to stay at this hotel  I read the reviews and was apprehensive but I didnt make the booking so I didnt really have a choice  It seems as though the reviews for this hotel are bipolar  My experience was definitely on the negative side  The staff seemed apathetic the room was small and the or depressing  I recently spent two weeks in Europe staying in budget hotels I can put up with tiny rooms shared bathrooms cheerless or and surly staff  I cannot put up with uncleanliness  There was debris on the carpet for instance toothpicks laying in the middle of the carpet  The bathroom floor had what I can only describe as crud in the grout and around the toilet  The tub was dirty and had peoples hair stuck in it  Hair was clearly visible on the floor  I was concerned that If they dont even pick clearly visible toothpicks off the floor do they wash the sheets My boyfriend asked that we be moved to a different room the staff obliged but that room was just as dissappointing  The other concerning event occurred while I was in the lobby  Several young men came into the hotel lobby and began soliciting people in the lobby   trying to give them fliers and stuff  They were rather harmless though they did mildly sexually harass me but they clearly had no business being there and the staff made no attempt at removing them  The only good news about this hotel is that they let us cancel everything and leave without a fuss Fortunately the Courtyard riott located right across the street had open rooms it cost approx   more a night  The difference was night and day  I highly recommend them   Courtyard riott Mag Mile   they are currently doing construction but only during business hours on weekdays  
P => Best location ever The hotel is one block away from the Magnificent Mile and thats why we went there  Also because its one of the cheapest in Chicago downtown We had to wait a lot to check in because the room wasnt ready  The room wasnt very clean either  We think that the person that cleaned it was loosing her hair because there were hairs everywhere yes even in our bed  Anyway if youre looking for a great location at a low price youll find it ok  
P => Great location could have been cleaner  Booked this hotel on Priceline and was somewhat concerned when we saw which hotel we won  The location relative to Michigan Avenue couldnt have been better  The room was ent sized and had a nice tv  The bathtub was dirty and didnt drain well and the carpet was not vacuumed very well  Its fine if youre looking for a room in downtown Chicago and dont plan to spend much time at the hotel  
P => felt cleaner before we showered    the streets would have been better We traveled with students and had a block of  rooms  Of the   tv remote controls did not work  tv did not work and  blowdryer did not work  There was a suspicious stain in one room that looked like blood  We found lettuce on the floor in one room and hair on the sheets in another room  After complaining and asking to switch rooms no action was taken  Finally we demanded a new room and were given a corner room with a leaking seal in the toilet leaving our floor wet the entire time  The rooms were not cleaned while we stayed there  The desk staff was incredibly polite and nice yet unable to do anything about the status of the dirty rooms  We stayed there for the location and the price but would not stay there again  Try the Congress Hotel or the Best Western are much better deals  
P => ent budget hotel right in the centre of downtown Chicago We have booked  rooms for myslefI my husband and a friend for  nights in   After reading the reviews and before checking  in to this hotel we were very skeptical to the point of even canceling our reservations but it is not as bad as the earlier reviews make it sound like  Infact it is worth more than the value we paid for the stay and the location It is a CLEAN ent budget hotel right in the centre of downtown Chicago  All major attractionsrestaurants are of walking distance Staff is courteous and polite Rooms were clean although it gives a slightly old feeling but has a LCD TV Towels and bathrooms were clean only problem was the shower which was not working in our room but it was alright in my friends room Even temperature control was working fine However please note that since it is a budget hotel there are no water bottles available within the hotel so it is recommended you carry one with you Overall good value for money  
P => Affordable and acceptable After reading the other reviews on this site I was expecting to have to barricade myself in my room while sleeping in my clothes and trying to fend off hordes of lice  In my experience this hotel does not deserve the reviews its received Let me preface this by saying this is a quotDISCOUNTquot hotel  And they even call themselves that  If you want high class go book the W  I made a weekend roadtrip into Chicago and wanted something very cheap and very central to get the most bang for my buck  Red Roof delivered First service  When I checked in the service was polite and to the point  They didnt chat me up try to up sell me or bother me with any other trivialities  They checked me in and showed me the way to my room  Sure its nice at the W when they ask you quotWhat is your wishquot but that comes with a price tag  The staff were helpful when I asked for directions and were not rude at all Secondly the room  After reading the reviews on cleanliness I gave my room a serious once over before unpacking anything  The room was a little run down as its an older building but there were no real cleanliness concerns  It was a little dusty under the bed with a few stains in the dark coloured carpet but nothing Id consider unhealthy  The sheets and towels were pristine white and clean  There were no odours or anything unpleasant as has been commented in other reviews The room was quite small  It would be a little cramped for a couple and I certainly wouldnt want to be sharing the room with kids  My room only had  bed though so the others  be larger  For  person it was perfect but I dont go on vacation to spend a lot of time in my room The room is also equipped with a safe My only complaints would be that there were a few broken items in the room  The window looked like someone had tried to force it open so I was able to actually remove it from its frame  I only noticed this because it was a little noisy but being right downtown thats to be expected  The AC also wasnt working in my room but I didnt need it at this time of year  It wouldnt surprise me if the two were related Third location location location  It doesnt get much better than this  block from the Miracle mile a  minute walk to the Navy Pier and less than  minutes to the John Hancock building  Its a phenomenal central location to be able to cover a lot of sites on foot Lastly value  I booked on priceline and got my room for night No complaints there considering the prices of other nearby hotels  Now valet parking was another night but after asking around that sounds like its pretty typical In conclusion as a single traveler looking for a cheap central hotel on a sightseeing vacation Id have no problem returning to this hotel again  
P => A great last minute ision  My friend and I visited Chicago in early il to see RENT  Unfortunately we had booked a room at the Howard Johnson that was completely horrible and was able to find this hotel with an opening at the last minute We were so grateful that they had a room for us  Paying night for parking kinda hurt but the valet takes the car for you and they were very nice and accommodating  The room was small but clean and cozy  All of the staff was very friendly  We wanted to go to the Field Museum on our last day and checked out at pm but they still kept our bags and car until we were done at the museum free of charge I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone  The price for the location and value was great 
P => this place is a flea bag I am not a very picky person and that is especially so when you only pay  for a room in downtown Chicago   you dont expect it to be fabulous but you do expect it to be clean  The room was so small we could hardly get a round the beds and the or looked like it hadnt been updated in  years  None of us would walk in the room without our shoes on because the carpet was so disgusting  I would compare it to a motel off the freeway in the middle of nowhere that you would pay  night or be pay for by the hour   We left and went across the street to the riott Courtyard  They said they routinely get customers like us  I will say the location is great and the staff was very nice and they took  off our bill without us really griping   Pay the extra bucks for somewhere ent  
P => Be afraid be very afraid Traveling with two teenage kids we paid extra for the quotdeluxe suite quot It was filthy  There were still crumbs on the floor and the bed sheets were NOT changed there was someone elses hair in the bed already How Gross  The room smelled like dirty socks  The bathroom door was off the hinges  The bathroom had mold on the sink vanity  There were candy wrappers in the corners of the room  The TV remote did not work  The AC rattled us out of the room  We ran out of this flea infested firetrap after staying one hour  We paid for    and completely enjoyed    the riot courtyard direct across the street  This is the ONLY post I have ever made on this website  
P => one step up from a homeless shelter This has to be the sleeziest dirtiest most disgusting hotel I have ever encountered  No heat no hot water leaking toilet and sink window didnt close all of the way filthy carpet dingy linens no customer service   The front desk was no help in correcting any of the problems with the room or with moving us into another one  I actually doubt they had another one in any better condtion to move us into  This hotel should be condemned  Its hard to believe the health department doesnt close them down because of all the mold filth and leaking urine from the toilet  I cant believe they have the audacity to charge money for these rooms  They should close down while they do reations  This hotel is in a great location and would do very well if it were not in such deplorable condition  One would think that Red Roof would see what they have with this building and at least bring it up to liveable conditions  Unless your standards are much below substandard you would do yourself a favor by steering clear of this pit  If you dont care about cleanliness or warmth at least make sure you are up to date on your vaccines and bring a supply of antibiotics  I would sooner stay in a homeless shelter than subject myself to this atrocity again  
P => Disappointing The hotel is well located but the rooms you would hardly wish to remember the window could not be properly shut and there was no heating   in the month of ember in this quotwindy cityquot  Well It seems that for this amount of money you cannot expect anything better in Chicago downtown    
P => Be Afraid  Be Very Afraid I stayed two nights at this so called hotel  It was more like a housing project  The only reason that I stayed there was because I had business at Northwesterns School of Law and this hotel was very close  Im surprised I made it out alive  The hallways are narrow and quite seedy  The elevators are slow and loud  This place  have been a grand hotel in   Now its a slum  Expect to take a shower in cold water as well  You can also expect to hear everyones conversations because the walls are paper thin  I seriously considered barricading the door to stop some thug from breaking in and robbing or boogering me  Yikes  Stay away  
P => Penicillin  be needed after staying here  Hotel Name Red Roof Inn Chicago Downtown  We were excited when we walked in and saw that the lobby had been reated  There were two lounge areas with new sofas and a big lounge table  There was a bracket for a flat panel TV but there wasnt a TV attached to it  The hotel only had one person at the desk at check in so there was a line that we had to wait in  The elevators were small as is expected in older city buildings  When we exited on our floor there was a pleasant smell from the deodorizer the housekeepers used  And the hallway was clean   Upon entering the room I noticed that the door was a little small not a quot standard  Although the room next to ours was handicap excessible  The second thing I noticed was that the rooms were not updated as the lobby was  THe room looked nothing like on their website  There were a few furnished updates such as lamps and a chair but the beds were small and low to the floor  The bed coverings were also outdated and looked worn  The sheets and pillow cases however did look new  I then looked over the room and the wall that enclosed the bathroom had a big crack down the middle and the wallpaper had started to peel away along the whole length of the crack  In the bathroom all of the grout had mold and mildew  The tile in the tubshower surround and above the sink had been painted and was peeling  The toilet was no longer affixed to the floor which I found out when I sat on it  And when I looked at the ceiling there was an attrocious ammount of BLACK mold all over it  The tile in the surround was also warped and regrouted be as if there was a ruptured water pipe  The only things that were done to make the bathroom look nice was a new mirror and light fixture   When walking out of the bathroom I looked at the entranceexit door and noticed that it looked as if the door had been pried open because the entire frame of the door by the deadbolt was cracked and pulled away from the wall  My husband and I were thoroughly disgusted with this hotel  
P => Good Price Good Location I stayed at the Red Roof Inn from     as part of a business training in the area  We had several rooms and chose the hotel basically on price and location alone  Hotel is in a perfect location  Although we were on business we were able to spend time enjoying ourselves because of the location   it was right off of Michigan avenue which meant many restaurants and shopping Although inexpensive the hotel was perfect for us  The rooms were very clean and it looked like they were beginning to update them as well  My room already had a new flat screen HD TV like I have at home nice touch and a few surprises we did not know about when we booked like coffee makers in the room  One of my colleagues had what looked like a reated room with new bedding and carpeting The only small negative thing was the lobby was being reated with new paint etc  but who cares   you dont stay in the lobbyIf you need an inexpensive clean and no frills hotel choose the Red Roof Inn on Ontario  
P => If you still stay here after reading this    If you still stay here after reading this you shouldnt bother with this website  I have stayed at this Red Roof several times and it isnt great but never as bad as this visit  Big trade show  All hotels unreasonable  Trying to save money  Big mistakeNo hot water  of  mornings  Tub didnt drain  of  mornings even after I complained  Didnt clean my room or make the bed one day  No soap or shampoo most nights  No towels one night  Sink falling off the wall toilet seat broken  Door wouldnt open a few times  Tiny room and bathroom  Plus it was a comedy of errors on the part of the maid service  They only had two very pleasant staff members in the entire hotel one night  I dont know how they stayed so nice and polite  This is a dive and is getting worse  I wonder if they have remodeled since the s  The mtc  guy said they were going to remodel starting soon but that wouldnt solve the cleaning staff problem  This is only the half of what was wrong    
P => Great location Red Roof locates just a street from the main shopping shopping stretch near COACH and jazz bars short walk to Hard Rick cafe Heaven on  ca food and convenience stores Room is cosy enough warm but dont expect great amenities  Service staff friendly recommended great places to visit   i would stay here again oh and its close to pizza UNO the famous Chicago deep dish pizza  yummy 
P => Get what you pay for Id read the reports of this hotel so I kind of knew what to expect  It was a central city hotel right on the corner of the Mag Mile with a relatively cheap price so I wasnt expecting any kind of luxury  Carpet could do with being changed but the bathroom was clean if a little tired looking  The room had a smell as the windows wouldnt open  The front desk staff were helpful with directions and maps   but my wake up call didnt come  Not a hotel I would recommend for a long stay but bearable for a couple of days before picking up my tour which was right outside the door  
P => Average place in a good location We stayed one night in the Red Roof Inn in ober   We booked the room online in advance  It was the least expensive option in the area and we did not have high expectations  We arrived early for check in but were accomodated efficiently by the front desk  The main glitch was that the first room we were assigned was still occupied but the front desk apologized and we got another room quickly  The room itself was a bit ragged  There were peeling paint on the ceiling in the bathroom and the furnishings looked a bit dirty but we think we just worn  The beds were okay but a bit soft  The room size was very big but oddly shaped   very long and narrow  Not a lot of amenties but the TV worked and there were no other issues with the mechanicals of the room  The front lobby did have coffee for free but we did not try any The location is the main reason for staying here  It is one block from Michigan Ave and fairly close to a lot of nightlife and restaurants in the area Overall if you need a place to sleep and do not need any frills this will do  
P => Scary Ugly and Noisy We stayed at the red roof inn for one night when we arrived early and the hotel we had reserved was full that night It was a horrible experience the rooms were small smelled weird and the door locks were loose  It was only my sister and myself so we used the iron board to hold the door shut  I wouldnt recommend staying at this hotel at all Worse this was that it wasnt cheap 
P => Not horrible but pretty bad This hotel is located in a prime area downtown  So location is good  However after notifying guest services a few times about no air conditioning in our room to no avail I gave up and took off the cover of the AC unit and messed around with it for about  minutes to get it work myself  So the customer service especially at night was poor  Additionally after paying for internet here the only signal I got was quotvery poorquot and I was unable to actually utilize the internet on my laptop  Again customer service was of no help SumyAlthough the location is good and the price is ent I would rather pay  or  more and stay at a nicer place downtown  
P => Red Roof Inn in downtown Chicago This hotel was horrible    dirty and nasty  We only stayed  night and I felt like I was going to get lice or worse  The carpets are filthy in the hallways and the rooms  The hair dryer didnt work the room was creepy and dirty  I slept fitfully and first thing in the morning found another hotel close by that for only  more a day was  percent nicer  I will never stay in another Red Roof Inn  I doubt that the CEO of the company would let his family stay at this place  It is a shame because it is a good location  
P => Recommend to stay elsewhere The only positive about this hotel is the location  It is extremely convenient not only to Michigan Ave but all the Mag  Mile area  It is  blocks to the Red Line ESPN Zone Niketown etc We were on a school trip and had  kids with  rooms  We expected better and out of  rooms you would think that at least more than half would be recommendable Just about everything was a bad experience  Front desk clerks were rude and indifferent  They had no hotel safe anywhere  The two elevators were extremely old and so slow  Hallways were dark dingy and dirty  The carpets were NASTY  Our socks were black from walking on the floors  The rooms were very small outdated  Bathrooms were falling apart  Some of the rooms had toilets that leaked faucets that leaked loose tiles clogged showerheads  It was a nighte There is no parking  Nothing  Nada  Youre on your own Chicago is way too big a city with too many options to choose this place  
P => Bottom of the barrel We stayed at the Red Roof because we were directed there by a wedding planner  One who must never have visited the site  From a distance the price seemed reasonable for the area so we booked a room  Where to begin  The elevator one broken the other on its way out  The management had the really bad sense to tell the guests that the cable broke  Off the elevator while it still worked and on to the hallway to the room  Dingy  Dark  Carpet dirty wrinkled and torn in places  Im getting the creeps  And then the room tiny even by NY City standards  We needed to move sideways around the bed  No room for a sitting chair  Battered furniture  The thick accumulated dust of months on non desk and dresser surfaces ie the furniture was dusted other horizontal surfaces not  There had been an attempt to reate the bathroom  This consisted of painting over the ceramic tiles and the tub  As might be expected said paint was cracked and peeling After one hellacious night on the medieval rack of a bed I grabbed my computer at AM and found a better deal at a lovely place  the Fairfield Inn  literally three doors down the block but a world of quality away complete with free internet and breakfast real shampoo in bottles big bars of soap and free magazines about Chicago We felt like wed checked in at the Ritz Overall this Red Roof was an over priced depressing experience  I would advise anyone to steer clear of it  Head down Ontario St  a half a block and check into the Fairfield Inn  
P => Great location for Michigan Avenue shopping The Red Roof is one small block from the main shopping street Michigan Avenue and therefore good for a number of shops  Unfortunately its not close to any subway stop so you  find yourself taking advantage of one of the many taxis which pass the hotel  Our room was comfortable with TV ironironboard hair dryer and air conditioner although the cool function didnt seem to work   There was no mini bar safe or coffee making facilities although there is complimentary coffee in the lobby  Our room and ensuite looked tired with flaking paint in the bathroom chipped bathtub and a toilet which was fitted so close to the wall they had to cut the handle to make it flush properly But at least it was all generally quite clean The staff were very friendly and helpful and they even sent someone to fix our blocked sink within  minutes of reporting it 
P => Price and location make it a good place to stay Visited Chicago from Cleveland with a group of friends  We stayed at the Red Roof    The hotel was ok  The rooms could use some updating or be a good scrubbing  We had a corner room and a wonderful view  Our group was all on the same floor  The shower was clogged called the front desk and they had someone to my room within a couple of minutes and it was fixed  The staff was friendly and helpful  There is good coffee in the lobby  The price for this hotel makes this a good option if you dont want to spend a fortune but want to stay in great location  
P => Remember it is an ECONOMY Hotel My friend booked a room in this hotel for us to share while in Chicago for a recent conference  And Ill admit I was a bit worried after reading some of the comments on this and other sites  But I was very pleased with the hotel the staff The LOCATION and the security   This hotel is NOT a luxury or resort hotel and if that is what You are searching for then just skip over it  But if You are a conference attendee a traveler who plans to spend more time out of the room than in it or someone who just needs a bed for the night then You will be pleased  The rooms were small and sparsely furnished but the beds were comfortable and there was more than enough room to unpack our luggage  The bathroom was TINY but adequate   just had to keep the makeup and grooming stuff out on the closet shelf  The room was obviously worn and dated but very clean   The staff were all friendly and charming and gave each guest their undivided attention while taking care of their needs  Sometimes the lines at the desk were a bit long but that was because of said attention to detail  I was more than happy to wait or just come back later as I knew I would also have great service The only negative I can think of was that the pseudo chino free coffee machine in the lobby was often not functioning   but I dont drink that stuff anyhow and would throw on a trench coat over my nightie each morning to go across the street to Starbucks  An added plus for conference attendees or super shoppers   there is a post office one block down so You can mail home Your conference materials or purchases 
P => Impressed Clean room TV microwave mini fridge desk comfy bed clean bathroom  For the price and location its worth the stay  The hallways are narrow so what and the elevators are pretty tiny and can be slow but you dont spend your time in elevators and hallways its the room that counts  Theres a Trader Joes down Ontario about  blocks   so you can load up on cheap fooddrinks and save a few bucks  Or take that  you saved on the Red Roof and splurge across the street at the Capital Grille  Bar Viand also across the street for cocktails and quiet conversations  
P => Great Location Just returned from a  night stay at the Red Roof Inn Chicago and have to say the location is fantastic for the price  One block from Michigan Avenue and within easy reach of Navy Pier John Hancock Tower and other sites As other reviewers have said the rooms are quite small but if you only need a place to rest and recuperate after enjoying Chicago then I dont think you can beat this place for the price   we paid just   per night  The bathroom was small but clean with a good shower and plenty of hot water We breakfasted at the West Egg   a great little cafe just around the corner from the hotel  We also had a good evening meal at Copperblue restaurant which is near Navy Pier All in all if you are on a budget I think that this hotel is ideal  
P => Made it through one night but would not stay again  We took a group of teenagers from our church for a quotsenior tripquot for the weekend  Luckily we only stayed one night at this hotel because we did not enjoy our stay  The rooms were small and had a very bad musty smell  The elevator is the smallest Ive ever seen and can only hold about   people with luggage  The hallways are narrow poorly lit and dirty  After the first day of sight seeing we returned to our room being very hot  We had the air conditioner running the whole time we were gone but it was obvious it was not working  We called the front desk and we were told the AC would not be turned on until next week  So we roasted the whole night The only good thing about this hotel is the location  I definitely would not stay again 
P => Great location basic service Red Roof is located in the heart of downtown Chicago easy walking to the lake parks restaurants shopping  And it is very moderately priced  But it is basic really basic  Tiny lobby  Tiny rooms  Dingy elevator  Room keys that needed to be reprogrammed twice in one day  If you want a reasonably priced place to stay in the middle of the city this is an ok choice but do not expect any amenities  
P => diamond in the ruff if you are in a hurry skip down to the last  paragraphsWe came to Chicago to see Widespread Panic Just me and my buddy i had searched for hotels all day on the day before we left and couldnt find anything under     in downtown chi town we ided to just get our tails over to chicago and see where fate led us After talking with some people we found there who were seeing the same show and visiting the lobbys of few hotel rooms   still no luck  we did find one place  travelodge that was willing to quotsqueezequot us into their sold out establlishment  exicted and happy we would be near the venue we pulled out our cash   then the reality of that visa commercial hit us   i am sure you all have seen it   everything stops when the guy trys to use cash in the symphony of everyone using charge cards anyway   to use cash they required a  deposit  unheard of  blasphemy  mainly because we didnt have  to leave sitting at the front desk until the next morning Heads down we walked out and down the street   we stopped at a camera shop and the kind people there let us use their phone book to make a cpl calls around and see if we had any luck that way i remembered red roof being one of the only afordable hotels i noticed online the previous day afordable without being downright scary that is  we called them after calling about  others  reservations said they had one room left and gave me the local phone    it was great   we called the local   and the service latasha and vette   were wonderful  they held the room for us until we could get there no credit card    they sold us the room without a deposit  i had to call them one time on the way there when we got stuck in traffic to plead for them not to sell our room   i didnt have to beg and vette said quotyour goodquot yes it was small   but for us it was PERFECT  two tour kids that just needed a place to crash under  it was clean and the people inside working and staying were nice alike  the lobby was reated and two rooms were done as well  the coffee machine in the lobby spun out really great tasting joe and at  in the morning when we needed to eat   front desk referred Ranaldis   the best pizza i have ever had  Chicago was great due in part from the red roof  we checked out the next day and thanked the staff for the kindness yesterday from the other two employees and they exclainmed quotwere nice tooquotthe place was perfect  
P => Getting Progressively More Horrid This is my second stay at the Red Roof Inn The property is conveniently located off of Michigan Ave and the staff is very friendly accommodating  That is about it The following things dont work or are not righta Second door or hotel opens at turtle speed b The elevators are chipped scuffed paper all over and dirtyc The hallway carpets th floor as a benchk are smelly and filthyd There is garbage and random ice buckets scattered on the floor next to  for three days of my staye Rooms smell This property is going down hill and down hill fast  It will be horrid esthetically in no time if the management does not start providing upkeep to the property 
P => Dirty I stayed at the Red Roof once last month in Chicago for  a night and my room had recently been reated was clean with a desk and ample outlets  The location is terrific Based on those benefits I ided to stay there again a few days ago  Bad idea  This time I was in a smelly room on the th floor that was dirty and dusty  The radiator was very loud and didnt make the room warm so I finally gave up and turned it off  Plus my room rate was   I twice had difficulty getting into the room because my key didnt work  The hallways were narrow and dim with streaks and scratch ks from peoples luggage rubbing everywhere The people at the front desk asnwer your questions but do so with reluctance So if you ide to stay at the Red Roof make sure you at least ask for a reated room 
P => Perfect for my needs This hotel is certainly not a  star class hotel but I give it  stars based on value  To begin with the location is superb  The week I visited all hotels were booked and rates seemed to be averaging  to  per night  The rates at Red Roof Inn were below   My corner room on the th floor was clean had a pleasant view of Ontario and Michigan Avenue and was cleaned every day  Granted the building is old but does have character  Though not huge the room was large enough for my needs  No there is no counter space in the bathroom but I have encountered this shortcoming in a number of boutique hotels fitted with pedestal sinks  It didn t pose much of a problem  I don t know about the other rooms but mine was fine  The ice machine on my floor worked fine The room was outfitted with a small desk and chair television and air conditioning that worked well an iron and ironing board plus a hair dryer  Shampoo and soaps were pretty generic  I d suggest packing travel sizes your favorites if it concerns you  Sheets were not designer label but they were clean an the bed well made  Plenty of pillows The staff was professional and extremely helpful  Plenty of wonderful restaurants within a block or two convenience stores drug stores   even a Trader Joe s  In addition I was told that within a few months all rooms would undergo reation  By all means if you enjoy luxury accommodations and don t mind paying the price   take advantage of the numerous grand hotels in the area  If you are looking for safe comfortable friendly lodging in a pristine location the Red Roof Inn might be the hotel for you  It worked for me  
P => Mixed feelings  a more expensive version of the old Cass When I thought about reveiwing this hotel I tried not to mention the old Cass hotel but it really is unavoidable What you get is about the same but for about twice the price  Now lets be fair the old Cass now costs about three times as much and for the moneylocation I think that the Red Roof is now the only game in town on the Magnificent Mile Plus PointsLocation Right on N Michigen AveCost Average of  plus   tax plus  hotel tax per nightBad PointsRooms a little care worn although clean  A bit like our old friend the old Cass  Carpets have seen better days but OK Room very poorly litNoisy AC although not really a problem for me as I can sleep throughanythingSheets not changed daily Staff a little bit uninterested Pet PeeveThe drinks vending machine was empty on arrival and still hadnt beenfilled on departure seven daysAll in all OK and the best value you are going to get these days on the Magnificent Mile  Just dont expect The Ritz  
P => Awful What an awful experience Walking into the room I was stunned at how small it was  I couldnt believe they fit two double beds in there  The bed felt like I was sleeping on concrete towels and sheets seemed to be made of sandpaper  And no matter what I did the room was always cold and slightly damp  I didnt want to go barefoot anywhere in the room or bathroom  It looked clean enough but I got the feeling it wasnt  The staff at the front desk was a joke  It took forever for to get someone to the desk to check out  I also asked for a wake up call  Good thing I set the alarm on my cell phone or Id have overslept  
P => Worst Hotel Ive ever stayed at This hotel was very inexpensive compared to others in the area and in a great location however I would never return to it again The room smelled musty the bathroom tub didnt drain and there were stains on the sheet and carpet  The lobby had been remodeled and was ok for an inexpensive hotel but the rooms are in desperate need of work  Only stay here if your budget doesnt allow for anything else and location is a major priority This is a Motel  wanna be 
P => Great Location and a Good Experience From reading the posts prior to coming to Chicago and staying at the Red Roof Inn I was not sure what to expect  But from our own experience we were pleasantly surprised  From the start the staff were very friendly and helpful  We were here for the y th holiday We stayed on the th floor and had a corner room  Our room was updated clean and our air conditioner worked well  We had a great view of the city and N  Michigan Ave  I think for a   a night in a city like Chicago and the location of the hotel you cannot beat what we got  If you are looking for  star this is not for you  I have to say our room was cleaned everyday We live in NYC and know that we would never find this hotel for the price ANYWHERE If your looking for a great location in Chicago no thrills and not looking for a fancy hotel room and spending hours in it this is the place for you It is really close to Navy Pier Magnificent mile all shopping several GREAT restaurants and public transportation  Some of our favorite restaurants wereWeber Grill great burgers ribs and steakBice restaurant which happens to be next to hotel ItalianBallos Italian You must try the meatballsGinos East Pizza great deep dish pizza the  min  wait is worth it Grand Lux Cafe great breakfastTempo Cafe another great breakfast order an omlet or pancakesAll of the above were reasonably priced and simply delicious Overall we had a great time in Chicago and would go back again and for the price and location would stay at the Red Roof Inn again  
P => Hated the Red Roof Inn I went in knowing that the room would be very basic and didnt expect much except clean  The room was horrible  Stuffing coming out of the sofa cushions  A toliet seat that clearly hadnt been cleaned  The air vent above the showere filled with dirt and dust  The outlet in the bedroom had no face plate and to top it all off our quotcleanquot towel had dried blood on it  NEVER AGAIN would I stay there  
P => Locatin location location I am so glad that I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and reserved a room here  I knew exactly what to expect   not so great room in an incredible location  My boyfriend and I are traveling across the country quickly and only had one day to experience Chicago  We didnt have time to stay somewhere cheaper outside town and take transit or drive and park  We arrived at midnight   the valet parked our car  We didnt see the car again until we left  The staff was polite but not overly friendly but we had everything we needed  We crashed as soon as we got into the room which was very small as indicated on this website  We woke up and hit Chicago which a half a block away  This hotel is in the best neighborhood   incredible  We walked all over the place during the day and did our sightseeing  We stopped at the room for a quick change of clothes and shower and hit the streets for dinner  The next morning we hit the streets and left  The only negative comment I have is about the air conditioner which wasnt negative for us  We love having loud white noise in hotel rooms   especially in loud cities  It drowned out any other noise  But if you are used to quiet at night this air conditioner probably would have bothered you  But the downtown location would probably bother you too  I loved this hotel and would stay again  All the other hotels in the neighborhood were  per night  We paid   for the Red Roof Inn  If you are picky and want to hang out in a perfect hotel room this is not for you  
P => You get what you pay for The Red Roof is not the most luxurious of hotels but is functional and well located and I would recommend it if youre looking for somewhere to stay on a budget in downtown Chicago True the rooms are not huge and the customer service is not great but our rooms were clean and quiet and for the price we paid I would not expect any more If you want an upket hotel dont stay here if you want a location right on the Magnificant Mile at a fair price this is a ent option  
P => basic hotel good location This is a basic hotel in a good location  The halls are tired narrow dirty and noisy  The room is small with a smell of cleaning products covering mildew  No chair or desk in the room  Sheets were clean towels were small and threadbare  The most challenging aspect was that the door to the bathroom would not stay open  You have to prop it open with the waste basket in order to get any ventilation  Its not the kind of place you take your shoes off in the room  The front desk staff is nice if under trained  For the location the price is very reasonable  Even though Im not giving it a very good review Id probably stay there again if I couldnt find a better price in the area  
P => happy with the Red Roof Receptionist was extremely nice  while we ordered a queen bedroom she offered to upgrade us with no extra charge to a king bedroom and also ask for our preferences whether we want upper or lower floor  Also asked if we would be using a laptop and anyhow gave us a very nice and spacious room  which looked like it was quite recently reated As previous posts I concur that the location couldnt be better  On the street the hotel is located are both a good Indian quotIndian Gardenquot and Italian restaurant quotBicequot  Also as recommended in previous posts  the quotWest egg cafequot is an excellent breakfast option There is also a cinema complex near by on Ohio st  just across a quotVirginquot mega store Our only complaint was that this red roof is a t mobile hotspot and it didnt function well  We bought a pre paid weekly pass and had a lot of problems both with the initial connection to the service and in later on usages  Still Im guessing the problem is more related to t mobile service than to the red roof Anyhow found the red roof to be a really good deal and had a pleasant stay there  
P => Great location but better off with Priceline There is only one reason to stay here   the location  block off Michigan Avenue and a few blocks from Lake Michigan is great That said there are many reasons not to  rooms are incredibly small by American standards and even compared to city centre hotels in a number of European cities  there is no charm  staff is neither rude nor customer service focused  in the summer youll tend to get fellow guests in the early s looking for a cheap place to stay while they party in Chicago which  or  not be desirable to you  its not as quotreatedquot as they lead you to believe  while not dirty the room wasnt cleanBut most of all reviewers focus on the price  Sorry but that just isnt a sufficient reason to stay here when you can use Priceline  If youve never used Priceline consider Chicago a great chance to start  In il  I booked a room at the Hyatt Regency on Wacker through Priceline for  each night and again booked the same rate during our trip in ruary  at the Holiday Inn t Plaza  In addition to simply being nicer hotels both rooms were  to  times larger than our room at the Red Roof  Literally   So if location is all you care about Red Roof can be a good find  If your focus is location and price due yourself a favor and try Priceline first  You wont regret it even if you pay a little more  If your focus is anything else dont think about staying here  
P => great location basic stay I travelled to this hotel with my Girl Scout troop  We were looking for the best location for as little money as we could get away with  The Red Roof Inn was perfect  The rooms are small but we werent in the room for more than sleeping and showers  The front desk staff was very helpful and understood that we were travelling on a tight budget  The hotel was fairly quiet for being so close to Michigan Avenue we only heard a few ambulances  I would highly recommend this hotel to budget minded families who want a downtown experience  
P => Cheap and cheerfull I booked the Red Roof Inn but didnt expect all that much based on the reviews from here and other sites However what we got was quite surprising It wasnt the most fabulous of hotels but it was more than worth what we paid and unless you plan on staying in the hotel all day you dont need much more than what you get from the place The reception staff were really really nice  They gave us extra pillows towels and hangers  Not just one or two like most hotels   they gave us loads  The people behind reception were helpful and friendly  We asked for a few things during our stay and they were super helpful The room was huge It was basic but thats what I expected  It had a king size bed when Im pretty sure I booked a double   bonus The only bad thing was the fact that the window didnt open but its to be expected  It was cleaned daily and was always spotless  The location is brilliant  Short walk from Navy Pier John Hancock Centre Michigan Avenue and most importantly the Herseys shopI was so surprised by the Red Roof Inn  I was expecting to be a bit disappointed but it was pretty cool Would defo stay again  
P =>  Abandoned  Property Everything was satisfactory at this unrekable hotel until after we checked out of our room and got to the airport  It was then my husband remembered that he when he took his shoes off the night before he put them under the bed and forgot to pack them  I called the hotel from the airport it was only two hours after we checked out and reported the forgotten shoes  The front desk clerk said there was nothing he could do about it right then and to call back later  I called back a few hours later and he said no shoes had been turned in by the housekeeping staff but to call back the next morning  I did   and still no shoes were turned in  I found this rather odd bc my husband knows he left the shoes there and I told them exactly where to find them  I called the Red Roof corporate office and told them about this and three days later I got a letter saying that any property left in the rooms is considered abandoned property  Abandoned property Even after I called and reported it within two hours Somehow I envision a maids boyfriend or husband walking around with my husbands almost new  pair of Timberland shoes  Never will I stay here again or ANY Red Roof in the future  Before this incident our overall stay was okay but the front desk staff could sure use an attitude adjustment  The front desk girl was on a very personal call when we checked in and had us wait while she finished making her after work plans  
P => Never Again    As mentioned the location of this hotel is great and thats about where it ends  The staff was indifferent and non attentive  When we first checked in the first room we were given wasnt cleaned yet  So we called down to the front and she was non apologetic and just said come down and ill give you another room  So back down we went to get a room  floors lower The bathroom left much to be desired with nothing but a tiny sink and toilet  no vanity space nothing  The room overall was drab and seemed dirty  The windows were so filthy you couldnt see out them  The heater went full blast all the time   theres no other option   tiny pillows a nasty brown blanket crunchy sheets and a bedspread that hasnt been washed in a while make up the bed We stayed here to save a few bucks weve stayed previously at the Fairfield right down the block and well never do that again  After a busy day in the city this room wasnt a relaxing refuge to come back to  
P => Great little place Great hotel  Rooms were a little narrow but for the price paid I expected a lot less  Room was very clean quiet considering it was in a busy area  Good location excellent for tourists looking to get a good nights sleep or a short stumble home after a big night out  Checked in very early am and had no hassles considering their recommendations are pm  Friendly and helpful service  
P => Fantastic Location for basic rates Just spent three nights at the red roof inn and have no complaints  The hotel is basic as you would expect for the rates but rooms where clean and big enough  Plenty of good places to grab breakfast all within a block if the complimentary coffee in the lobby isnt enough for you Big selling point for red roof though is location literally on the Mag Mile which is fantastic and surprisingly clean and hassle free As w a whole would recommend Chicago and hotel  Worth jumpimg in a taxi about  to wrigleyville for a night out plenty of cool bars One complaint about hotel must be on a hospital run as can occasionally hear the wailing of ambulance sirens at night  All in all though good value 
P => Great Location OK so this place is not the Ritz But what it does have is a fantastic location and rates that cannot be had within a seven block radius on the Magnificent Mile  From here the city of Chicago is laid at your feet for the exploring The rooms are a bit dated but I had no troube with cleanliness and my room was spotless  Rooms smaller than normally found in the US but massive by European standards  Front of house staff were generally helpful and Lashanna in particular was outstanding Nothing was ever too much trouble for her and she was professional and pleasant throughout Main down points are the lack of complimentary wireless Internet and breakfast although you can purchase wifi access cards and there is good reception in the roomthere is free coffee and tea served all day in the Lounge  Overall a great choice if you want to see Chicago on a budget  
P => Terrible Hotel   Too Cramped and Uncomfortable I stayed at the Red Roof Inn Chicago for the Chicago athon weekend  It was a dreaful experience to put it nicely  Here is my list of reasons NOT to stay at this property   Front desk staff unattentive and unknowledgable  Cramped rooms   Ive stayed at the W in the financial district and the room was the same size but did NOT feel cramped   Heating system did not work properly   either too hot or too cold  You could feel the coils through the bed   not good for post athon sleep   Shower did not have hot water   only took lukewarm showers   I booked a room in uary and they gave me an quotaccessiblequot room   no bathtub  No free internet accessOn top of all that they were refacing the front part of the building and I had a layer of dirt on my clothes and the bed  I could not believe how horrible that was I was blowing my nose all weekend   I asked to change rooms and they were unapologetic and did not work with me DONT stay at this hotel    there are far better properties in Chicago 
P => Below Average Why is this hotel such a great deal for being just steps from Michigan Avenue Because the rooms need serious attentionHousecleaning vacuumed but didnt bother to go into the corners or next to the bed we found skittles MampMs Advil and dust bunnies on the floor  They must have used a dirty rag to clean the bathroom  Hair on the walls in the soap tray and top of toilet  The toilet seat was falling off and when we arrived there was no soap or extra toilet paper OOPS  The bathroom smelled like urine which made us wonder if they even bothered to use disinfectant cleaner  We realized that it was Halloween but did not appreciate the REAL spider webs all over the windows Last but not least there is a hospital nearby and Ontario is the one way street that the ambulances use to race to the scene with loud sirens and honking horns  Remember accidents happen at ALL times of the day and night even at three in the morning  Bring your earplugsWe stayed at this hotel because it was one of the cheapest near MIchigan Ave  and we were just looking for a place to sleep  Now we know why it was so cheap and NOW YOU KNOW WHY ALSO If you are bringing children do not even think about staying at this dirty unsanitary siren screaming hotel Buyer beware You get what you pay for  
P => Great location for the money we paid My husband and I just got back from a weeklong trip to Chicago I was adamant to stay in the downtown or Mag Mile areas despite the high room rates because I wanted us to be in the middle of everything  But we were on a budget The pros Rates about half of those for hotels just across the street  Clean rooms and quiet considering the location of downtown  We had the choice of several king size rooms on different floors   getting a th floor room was ideal as it kept noise to a minimum Location   just a short walk to Water Tower and Hancock  Michigan one block over A great breakfast place just down the street   the West Egg Cafe Free coffee hot water for tea and hot chocolate available at all timesA  hour Dunkin DonutsBaskin Robbins is across the streetPatient staff who answers questions of first time visitors instead of brushing them offWe will definitely recommend them for anyone on a budget who wants to stay in downtownMag Mile Chicago  
P => Value and convenience On the advice of other TripAdvisor members I requested a king size bed  The room was small but there was enough room for one person  With two people it would be quite cozy  Three people   e g  parents and a child   well its probably best to pick a location and stick with it  The elevators are a bit on the slow side  The hallways are narrow and tired looking but the rooms are fine  The mattress was in good shape not too soft not too hard  There are reading lights over the bed and a desk and lamp  The bathrooms are small and the door will not stay open  And if you had the door open you couldnt use the toilet anyway  There was plenty of hot water  There is no extra counter space  My sink and toilet top slanted forward so anything not carefully place would slide into the sink or toilet  The tub is not low sided nor does it have grab bars so if you have a disability plan ahead to get a room that is accessible  The tub does have some texture on the bottom so it is not slippery Wi fi is available for a fee  If you are only there for a day or two you might want to get day passes    One months access is    I lucked out and got an end room which had two windows so connection strength was excellent  The desk clerk said it was not very good in some rooms in which case the guest has to come down to the lobby The lobby is nice with places to sit a TV and tourist info  There are two machines that offer a variety of coffees hot water and hot chocolate all day  There are no steps to deal with an automatic door and valet parking available But the shortcomings of this place are overlooked by the great value and great location  Its cheaper or as cheap as any other place downtown  With an AAA discount my rates ranged from  night depending on whether it was a weekday or weeknight  Its within easy walking distance of many restaurants some of which are recommended in travel guides  There are small food stores drugstores and a laundromat within a few block radius  There is a subway station about   blocks away but Michigan Avenue is but a block away and you can catch many buses there  While the room is average the problems can be overlooked  I rate this property above average because of price and location  
P => Great value for money for Chicago I was a bit worried about this place from some of the reviews    but I neednt have been  The staff was courtious the hotel was clean albiet small and the location could not be better  If you like luxury hotels and spend most of your time on vacation in your hotel room   splurge and stay somplace else  But if you intend to spend your time experiencing Chicago and just sleeping in your room at night    this is the place for you and youll save yourself a good  per night I paid night  
P => Excellent value We stayed at the Red Roof over the y th holiday we have stayed in Chicago before and have paid more than  for a nice hotel this cost us  a night inclusive of tax  The rooms are very clean and whilst reviews on this site state the rooms are tiny I would say they are smaller than a standard motel room but not tinywe were travelling route  and this was our first stop on a  week stay so we had plenty of luggage  The location as most reviews have stated is superb and cannot really be beaten  The free coffee in the foyer is a nice touch in a morning although it is available  hours  Overall we were impressed with the Red Roof and would have no hesitation whatsoever in staying again 
P => Great Location Stayed for  nights  Originally rqstd one bed got two booked on line rd party  Room quite small wtwo beds  Have to shift body sideways to let other person by though roomsbath tiny are very clean  Went to front desk that evening and spoke wAllyn who was incapable of a securing a next day room change and was told to speak to anyone the next morning  Valerie the next morning was quick and courteous to help locate a one bedded room  Rm queen  Though it was a smoking room what a difference Much roomier room and bathroom figured out it was a handicap room complete wwriting desk and chair  Definitely made the stay more enjoyable  Thanks again to Valerie who was kind and helpful Erica was great at c i amp c o and wlocal brkfst  recommendations  Go to West Egg Cafe for breakfast til pm if your a late sleeper two blocks away  All hopping win walking distance  KING TUT exhibit til   is disappointing no sarcophagus  Get tickets in advance sells out quickly for the day  
P => Loved the Red Roof Inn We stayed at the Red Roof Inn in downtown Chicago in e  after reading the reviews at this website  The rooms were tiny as are most in the high rise hotels in Chicago but very clean and well equipped  I brought my own coffee maker to use in the room because they dont have them but they have gourmet coffees available in the lobby  hours a day  There is also a Starbucks right across the street  The hotel is very centrally located walking distance to just about everything  It is a little noisy with all the traffic if you want to sleep in but great for being in the midst of everything  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful and everyone always had a smile on their face  The parking was extremely expensive and the amount changed from when I called to inquire about it  The website said to call for current rates I called two nights before my arrival date  They said   and then it was   a day by the time I checked out  They apparently switched valet companies on me during my stay  But other than that it was a great place to stay much cheaper than the surrounding hotels and I would stay again in a second 
P => Great Location good value We booked the hotel based on the comments below and agreed its a good value for money  Its located in the hotels district which is close to many restaurants cinema and just next to the shopping street  The following sights are all within walking distance Museum of Contemporary Art HIstoric Water Tower and Pumping Station LUMA which is showing a very interesting exhibition quotThe Gods as We Shape Themquot through   and the Hersheys Chicago store  
P => Great location and good value for money We stayed at the Red Roof Inn Chicago for  nights in e  The location is great   a half block from the Magnificent Mile Michigan Ave   lots of shopping  We walked to most locations  Cht the Chicago hop onhop off bus for the first  days  The first day we re acquainted ourselves with the city its been  or  years since we last visited Chicago  We took the Heritage bus tour too  The next day we hopped off at the Museum of Science and Industry and saw the wonderful Da Vinci Exhibition  Another day we boarded the Wendella Chicago River and Lake cruise  hrs  It was a beautiful clear blue sky day and the tour was another winner The Inn is in an area thats scattered with lots of eateries   TGIF ONeills Bar a cute all day Corner cafe where lots of locals eattake away breakfastlunch etc and a chinese restaurant across the road from the RR Inn and the usual take away joints    your choice of food and prices    Check incheck out were quick and painless I had booked on the web and pre paid Front Desk staff were friendly and obliging when we asked for advice on where to get a snack  Our th floor room was small but had a really comfortable king size bed my husband is quot and I really appreciated that the request for a queen size bed had been taken into consideration  The bathroom was small   showerbath combination  The toilet was also in the bathroom  Our airconditioned room overlooked the street and the building opposite  It was quiet enough just the usual doors slamming in the corridor with inconsiderate patrons Chicago is a clean green Australia is still suffering from drought conditions and the architecture is wonderful 
P => Good Location small rooms This is a great location when visiting Chicago  It is within walking distance of everything  The hotel staff is very nice and easy to work with  The rooms and the elevators are TINY Two people couldnt walk around at the same time  We had one room with a king size bed and a different room with  doubles and the beds took up the entire room  The elevator was very small  It was clastrophobic  Our ac was broken so the staff transferred us to another room  The staff was very knowledgeable when it came to the train station  Very good stay except for the size of the rooms  
P => A perfect location I recently stayed for  night at the Red Roof Inn downtown Chicago I booked it tjrough Expedia and got a very good deal I was very surprised when I arrived to discover its location for this price it was VERY centraly located around the corner from Michigan Avenue The hotel is not the best I have stayed but for this budget it worked fine for me The rooms are a bit dated and need refurbishement but bathrooms are very nice and clean Moroeover the frontdesk and cleaning staff were very nice and helpful doing their best to please us One thing was missing though  no restaurant to get breakfast at the hotel there is only a free coffee machine in the lobby  but it was no problem for us as there was plenty of places to eat in the morning especially a nice bakery with a terrace around the corner from the hotel Overall I would recommend it to travellers on a budget looking for clean cheap amp central accomodation in Chicago  
P => Very good value and location I agree with many of the positive comments written so far about the Red roof  Rooms are indeed quite small but we took the business king suite  more than a regular room that had two washrooms a king bed and a queen sleeper sofa   perfect for two adults and three children  There was a fridge  microwave two TV s and everything was quite clean  Its a great location and for the price a very good deal  The staff is also very helpful Finally I share the same opinion with others that mentioned that its an older building with elevators that are rather small and slow and the noise from the street can sometimes be heard  That being said I find those points to be rather secondary in relation to the other good aspects of this hotel  
P => Borderline Accommodations I stayed here on business    You get what you pay for  It was the least expensive suite hotel in the area and for a reason  Just a little creepy based on the clientele hotel staff and old building  I stayed here to see if I couldshould bring my family here this summer for sightseeing  Compared it to the Seneca and Homewood Suites and will choose one of the others  Red Roof has the best location but just barely met my modest standards  It isnt for the family  
P => Good location This hotel could not be in a better location  It is a block from the Magnificent Mile and some really good restaurants including The Cheesecake Factory  The lobby has just been updated and the staff was very nice but the rest of the hotel is very old and a little run down  The rooms were very small and not very nice but we were just there for a long weekend and it worked  As long as you are not claustrophobic you should be ok  The lobby has plenty of information for visitors and taxis are easy to catch out front  Because everthing is tight fitted noise is an issue for those morning birds or late night guests who dont know how to respect other guests  You should request a low floor because the elevator seems to always be crowded and takes forever  Also dont plan on showering before check out time because there was no hot water 
P => Good location clean but small rooms For the price a very good deal  Its a great location and our room was clean  if quite small  with a comfortable king sized bed and small desk with comfortable chair and  inch TV Its an older building so the heaters are noisy and not always totally effective and the elevator is tiny and slow especially if you stay on the top floor  Also keep in mind its often used by school groups and the walls arent especially thick so it can be noisy at times but we never had trouble sleeping  Staff are friendly and helpful  
P => Location Location Location The best thing about this hotel is its location  You cannot move for shops restaurants bars etc The price of the hotel was reasonable and in comparison to the other hotels in the immediate area was probably quite cheap The hotel is in an old building  The foyer has been modernised and is quite comfortable with very good friendly staff  The lifts to the rooms are small and are often quite busy  The rooms themselves are small and whilst the bartroom was clean it was evident that the hoover did not reach the corners of the room with a thin layer of dust running around the edge If you are fussy kind of person then you will find plenty to fault this hotel  If you are using it as a base for exploring this great city are not spending too long inside the rooms and are sensible with your money then this hotel makes a great deal of sense  
P => Great small hotel    keep fire safety in mind The Red Roof Inn Chicago is a great small hotel property in the city and the location is prime  Its just a few blocks away from the main thoroughfares and in a good neighborhood between the hospital campus other hotels and busy restaurants Front desk staff is very courteous and the few times I called for assisance I got quick responses  Like many old properties hallways are small elevators smaller and rooms are not traditional U S  size  But they are not jammed either and the owners have invested in contuing upgrades to the public areas and rooms and the or is very current in all areas with good lighting and comfortable furnishings Not many people consider fire safety when they select a hotel and older properties have their own challenges  Nevertheless my stay at the Red Roof Chicago was the first time in a while that I was conscious of the fact that I was in a building with no central sprinklers and the two exit stairs consist of one internal staircase around the corner from the main hallway and a rear fire ESCAPE i e  an outside metal mounted staircaseladder not a stairwell  Federal employees generally are required to stay in newer properties with more fire safety systems and I am in no way suggesting that the property is not safe    in fact hallways were always clear well lit alarm system appeard to be upgraded and there are fire extinguishershoses  But its worth remembering that not all hotels have the same level of life safety technology available  At the very least just being a little more aware of fire exit locations is a good idea when staying in an older property like this one  
P => Great Location but Horrible Hotel I travel all over the world and I would not stay at this hotel again  Although the location is perfect the place is old and disgusting  There was hair all over the bathroom walls and the floor was dirty  One crumby dresser with a TV on top  The room was tiny  Heat was broken and noisy and we ended up getting  off because they couldnt fix it  Also there is only one tiny elevator and there was a convention in the hotel so we had to wait a long time for the elevator whenever we wanted to go out  Shop around or walk an extra block and pay a few dollars more because this place is NOT worth it  
P => Red Roof Inn a cheap gem Stayed at the Red Roof Inn in    First of all great location one block from North Michigan and the shopping Check in was all of one minute and I was in my room immediately It is an older hotel so the carpet is not brand new but I dont choose a hotel for the carpet  My room was extra clean and bathroom was immaculate  The only quotdisappointingquot thing I encountered was the ice machine on the nd floor where I stayed  It was broken so I went to the th floor where the other is located  That gave me all but  ice chips after about a  minute wait  I highly recommend this hotel  I will definitely stay here again  
P => Location Location Location     and great price After reading the reviews here and a personal recommendation from a friend we ided to try this Red Roof Inn  Me and  other friends traveled to Chicago for a girls weekend and knew we wouldnt be in the hotel much  We were just looking for a safe clean place close to the shopping and sight seeing areas  This suited our needs  Its nothing fancy  We had a suite and were pretty satisified  The full bath was very very cold since it was on an outside wall and had a window  But the water temperature was good  Heater was very hot in one room and cool in the other  Our suite had a refrigerator and microwave but no coffee pot in sight  Coffee is only available in the lobby and only in the morning  Room was clean and furniture in good shape  Requested non smoking room but was given smoking with no option to switch to another non smoking suite  Only offered a non smoking double  We checked out the suite and ided it wasnt too bad  Although the hall reeked of smoke some mornings  The desk staff could have been friendlier except for one exceptional young lady there and they need to invest in coffee pots for each room  Visit West Egg Cafe down the street for breakfast get there early to avoid the line and Joey Buonas for great Italian pizza and pasta  
P => Good Location and Good Price The Red Roof Inn is in an ideal location if you want access to Michigan Avenue  The hotel is located near many eateries and bars Try ONeils    store fronts down from RRI the bar is only  feet wide but a great time  The staff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful  The only issue we had with the hotel was our room was not clean  There was some issues in the bathroom and trash on the floor  The hotel rooms are very small as well but as long as you do not want to hold a social in your room your ok  I would stay here again based on price and location  
P => Downtown Chicago bargain We visited Chicago the first weekend in ember with our two teenage sons  We were looking for something affordable yet close to the sights and booked the Red Roof Inn based on reviews here at Trip Advisor  The hotel was exactly what we were looking for inexpensive in the heart of downtown clean friendly staff  Yes the room was a bit crowded for  but we werent there much and the convenient location was more than worth it It was perfect for a family on a budget  Dont stay there if you want luxury or extras but if you are happy with the basics its the right place for you 
P => Great Hotel This is one of the best hotels in Chicago because of its price and location  Its half a block away from the Magnificent Mile and is surrounded by very good restaurants  There are also convenience stores near the hotel  Very convenient to public transportation  We stayed in a standard room during our first night  The room was small but clean  The bed was comfortable  The next night we moved to the King Suite which had a lot of room for  people  The staff was very helpful and friendly  
P => Impressed with the Red Roof Inn Very well located clean and pleasant rooms   I would stay here again in Chicago 
P => Great Place Great Location Great Price Just got back form the Red Roof Inn Chicago  First the location is EXCELLENET    Block from everything you want on the magnificent mile and next to it is the riott whose prices were x that of the red roof inn  The rooms were nice  We got a king Suite with king bed and bath in one room and a arate living room with fold out bed and its own bath  We also got a double deluxe with a big room and two double beds  The staff was very friendly and helped us with everything we needed  We had a late flight leaving and we were able to store our baggage after we had checked out and they have internet that you can rent  The are remolding and it looks like the place will be ever better the next time we stay there  This is not a  star but it is a wonderful place for the price I HIGHLY suggest the red roof inn  
P => Great Location I stayed at the RRI this summer my teenage son and nephew  I got the deluxe room with two double beds  I guess by getting the deluxe room we did not have the problems some other reviewers had with storing luggage and moving around  There was an area outside the bathroom for our luggage and clothes  We left the hotel early each morning and returned late at night so we were only there to sleep  The room was clean and the location is great  I did not want to spent a lot on a hotel so the RRI was perfect for us  We ate at the Corner Bakery which was a block away for breakfast  
P => Great value great location no frills I was pleasantly surprised by my short early week stay here  The location is perfect in the heart of downtown close to great restaurants and bars  But dont stay here if you want the extras they dont have them  There is no one waiting at the door to assist you with your baggage the rooms are small and the bathroom smaller you  have to go to another floor for ice  I would estimate its been  years or more since the carpet has been replaced  Although they just started re doing the small lobby the day I left However the staff was friendly and helpful and you cant beat the price for this area of town  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Mediocre Hotel We paid only night by booking through Expedia  The location is great   a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and bus stops  The subway stop is several blocks away though  The room is too small for more than two people in my opinion  My partner and I had just enough space for ourselves and two suitcases  The hotel only has two small slow moving elevators serving  floors  The elevators were often full and we would have to wait for it to come around again We were given a smoking room even though I had requested non smoking  One of the bedspreads had several dark brown stains and we requested to have it changed on our first morning there  I pulled the bedspread off and then I placed it on the floor with the stains clearly visible  The housekeeper made the bed with the same stained spread  I called and requested a new spread again and then I made the bed myself once it was delivered  The bathroom was very clean    a definite plus  None of the front desk staff members we encountered were personable  We talked to several staff members and none of them seemed enthusiastic to be there  Two different staff members were engaged in obvious personal calls while checking in guests  One was talking about her baby shower and another one was making plans for later that night  I requested a second luggage rack but my request was denied because they do not keep extra on hand  Overall we were not real impressed with hotel  The price was great but the staff and cleanliness were not impressive  
P => Better than the price indicates  Last year I stayed at the hotel across the street from the Red Roof Inn  This year that hotels price went up about  a night  This required a change in accomedations for this years trip  We had seen the RRI last year and ided that it was worth looking into for this years trip  Boy am I glad I did that  Its the same location for half the price When I judge a hotel there are two things I look at  The first is the bathroom and the second is the cleanliness  At this RRI the bathrooms were a little tight around the toilet but the shower is roomy  The rooms were very clean and the housekeeping came every day  We got rained on two of the days we were there and the front desk gave us extra towels with no questions  These rooms are small and there is minimal furniture in them  They are shapped like a long rectangle with the door and the head of the beds against the long side  Theres about  feet from the end of the bed to the other wall  This makes them feel smaller than they are  If you have more than one piece of luggage per person the room will get crowded as there is no real good place to store you bags  We paid extra for a refridgerator and microwave and it was worth every penny  There was a desk in a corner and a small dresser with the TV on top of it  The hangers were at the far end of the room near the bathroom I do want to stress that for the price this is the best hotel near Michigan Ave  
P => happy staff happy customersequals a great stay my wife and i stayed at the red roof from t  to th we got the L train from ohare to clark st   each and a  cab to the hotel the staff were very pleasant for the whole visit and any advice or tips were no problem to them the location was great  yards from michigan avenue and  to  minutes stroll to navy pier loads of resturants and bars nearby the room we got on the th floor was very clean and tidy and had two double beds we paid  you could pay a lot more for something more upket but if your their to see the city and not law and order  times a night this hotel was just fine enjoy 
P => Good Experience for the Price We stayed at the Red Roof Inn when we were in town for a wedding  I wasnt expecting much and was pleasently surprised  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable  The location is fantastic  The room was smaller than I expected   even for a city hotel  If you are traveling as a couple alone I would suggest requesting a room with one king sized bed  Our room had  double beds and it was difficult to navigate  We had trouble finding places to put our suitcasesOverall it was a good experience  
P => Great Value This hotel is a wonderful suprise  Like every other review says the rooms are small  But if you are in Chicago and spending your time in your hotel room other than to sleep there is something seriously wrong  This hotel is very clean and quiet  It is so close to everything  It is only one very small block from Michigan Ave  All city transit is very close and accessible  All the major shopping is close  It is close to restaurants  Anything you could possibly need  The West Egg cafe is the place for breakfast  Just one block from the hotel  There were line ups for this place every morning we were there  My only complaint of the hotel is that there was only one staff on at night  We had called down to the front desk for more glasses and we were asked if we could come down and get it as they were the only one working at the time  But for the price we paid it was a small inconvience  We had looked at other hotels in the area that were almost twice the price and i am very glad we did not pay the extra  This really is a great value hotel  Also for deep dish pizza you have to go to Ginos East probably the best pizza i have ever had  It was about a     min walk from the hotel straight down Ontario St  
P => Great Value  I want to say first that i was very nervous about what to expect  I had read a lot of reviews on your site about Chicago hotels and the prices being paid   i didnt know what to expect  Boy was i ever PLEASANTLY SURPRISEDThe Red Roof Inn is a very nice hotel in the heart of Downtown Chicago  I read about small rooms but the key i found was getting the quotKING SUITEquot like  night more   it was plenty of room for my wife and i and  teenagers they slept on the fold out sofa  TVs  Bathrooms Microwave amp Fridge in the room  We paid night compared to  night in hotels that we walked past on a daily basis i e  same location The Best part of the deal was the location  You are literally  short block off the heart of Michigan AvequotMagnificent Milequot  Free Trolleys run to all the places we wanted to go museums shopping navy pier parks etc  which you can catch within  minutes walk from the hotel  Lots of wonderful restaurants we took the Amtrak to Chicago from San Antonio wanted to quotexperiencequot the train and never rented a car  We did mostly the trolleys and a few cab rides Again the room was very nice not the  Seasons but comfortable beds nice linens and very clean   plenty of hot water  This is a GREAT place for budget minded families who are more interested in Chicago and a nice place than a quotpalace type roomquot By the way I tried the Garretts Popcorn caramel corn it was AWESOME   i knew it had to be good when i counted  people standing in line waiting to get it on Michigan Ave   well worth it if you like caramel corn Thanks TripAdvisor    i will ALWAYS use your site in my future travels 
P => Wow Small rooms My friends and I stayed at the Red Roof Inn from e    I had trouble iding between  and  stars  The room was very clean which is wonderful but it was SO SMALL We just could not get over how small the rooms were  I had read reviews in which they said that but thought quotHow small could they REALLY bequot and booked there anyway  The answer SMALL  There was hardly anyplace to store our luggage or anything no room to walk at all and the bathroom was tiny too  It reminded me of some of the tiny hotel rooms you see in Europe or something  The front desk staff was nice enough  This is definitely a no frills hotel and you get what you pay for  So the good things were that it was a clean hotel but if I had to do it all over again I would pay a little more money and stay someplace nicer  
P => Excellent place to stay Great place location and price If you want to go to the windy city for a couple of nights this place is perfect  You are just a few steps away from Michigan Ave  My room was clean when I arrived and was cleaned every morning  My only complaint is with the heat in the room  It was about  degrees outside and the heater was blowing cold air  I went to the front desk to ask for a blanket  Im thinking for the rate Im paying at this place asking for an extra blanket is fine  I could be paying night across the street at another hotel and still have the same problem  Not a big deal to me  When I came back to the room the next day they had replaced the heating unit in my room The staff was very friendly  It is not a place for those looking for the treatment you receive at some other hotels  There is no free breakfast no bellhop no room service and no USA today paper delivered at your door  I think a free paper might have been available at the front desk though as well as free coffee Valet parking is available  I paid  for it  If I chose to park the car myself and carry my stuff to the room it would have been    extra bucks well spent in my opinion  Best value in downtown Chicago 
P => Great Place for the Price You probably cannot find a hotel with a better location in Chicago at a rate anywhere nearly as reasonable as the Red Roof Inn  The rooms are small and somewhat out of date but if you are in Chicago why are staying in your room anyway Get out eat the great food and have fun  We asked the staff for recommendations and received great advice on restraurants and cafes  Although I consider this a good place to stay when you are in Chicago for fun I could not recommend the Red Roof for a business stay unless your goal is to save money  
P => Perfect location spotless and comfortable   
P => Red Roof Inn CheepClean and good location  
P => Uhh Can you say gross and tiny  
P => Best Deal in Town  
P => great place  
P => Dissatisfied with Red Roof

P => Ups and Downs I was in Chicago for business and stayed with another colleague in a room  The room was very clean but the hotel is a bit cheap when it comes to bathroom amenities  There were two of us booked in the room  why only one bath robe Turn down service was spotty  One night we had a drink in the room our wine glasses were taken but never returned until we called  There is a service called quotDelighted to Servicequot    the person who answered when I called apparently wasnt told you were supposed to be friendly when a hotel guest callsThe bar in the hotel o is a complete rip off  One night  of us met for drinks   of my friends ordered the special tinis at  each  When the first one arrived we lhed and joked that the waitress must have been thristy since it wasnt even  full the second itini was also less then  full so we joked that the waitress must have tripped and spilled some  The friend who ordered an expensive wine got about  inches of wine if that The hotel does have great facilities for conferences which is why we were there  It is not cheap  I might stay there again but if they want to rate the hotel as a  star the overall experience needs to be upgraded  
P => Excellent Location Comfortable Rooms Other reviewers had it right   the hotel and rooms are nice pretty standard for business travel and the location is excellent  I had a standard king room which was quite large and comfortable  The room and bathroom were clean and housekeeping was thorough every day though I could do without the excessive air freshener  Room service variety and efficiency was above average  There was noise from the nearby El even on the th floor but not enough to disturb me I sleep with ear plugs   other travelers might be more sensitive  Overall a solid choice for business travel  
P => Excellent hotel and Location We loved the hotel and the location  We stayed here for a Sat  and Sun  and would have spent another night if the hotel hadnt been full  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful  The room was very clean and roomier than we expected for a center city hotel  The rooms were also very quiet althouhg you could here the El if you were on the backside of the hotel  The location was also excellent and we walked to restaurants the Sears Willis Tower and the Chicago River boat tour that left from Michigan and Wacker Dr  Of course we had very good weather chilly but no rain or we woudnt have been able to do this   probably would have taken taxis since driving and parking are a hassle if youre not used to it  We did not move our car for  days  We did not eat here so I cant rate that though they do have a Starbucks on premise which we used for morning coffee after finishing the small pot of coffee in our room  There were just too many other places to try for food  I have two recommendations that might help others On weekends use one of the parking lots within a block of the hotel since there is plenty of parking available and they charge a lot less than the  per night we paid to park at the Renaissance  Also if you dont have to be on the river there are several other hotels by riott that are very close to this one but are less expensive  
P => Solid This is a solid business hotel with clean rooms and a central location  I booked a quotClubquot room and it was quite large with a huge bathroom offering a arate tub and shower and a large single sink vanity  The room itself was clean with pretty standard international hotel style furniture and a  inch flat screen TV  The breakfast offerings in the Club Room were a little uninspiring I did not have the opportunity to try any of the other hotels dining outlets The hotel is located right on the river and was quite near to my meeting locale  I would say that this property is a solid BA  business hotel  it is not a trend setting property in any way but it serves its purpose well  
P => Consistently Solid We travel to Chicago frequently for leisure and Ive been many times for business  Ive stayed at several hotels downtown and this is where we consistently choose to stay when we are there for fun  It certainly helps if you stay enough nights at a riott in a year to earn quotstatusquot but weve always been treated appropriately and efficiently at this hotel As riotts go it is pretty consistent  The rooms are larger than many youll get in Chicago and the price is typically on the lower end of the ent hotels  They recently updated the lobby bar to something much more trendy and approachable than what they had  We did not go   but it looked neat enough If you are looking for boutique hotel or high end treatment this is probably not the right place for you  If you want a ent size room consistent and friendly service and not a ton of frills   this place is highly recommended Parking is not cheap   but that shouldnt be a mystery and it is posted all over their website and at the hotel  Internet is also a charge   unfortunately something that nearly all of the quotnicequot hotels continue to do  Room service is also not a cheap meal   but this is also something that shouldnt be a surprise  There is anywhere from  star dining to fast food within about  feet of the door so that shouldnt be an issue Location isnt bad for Michigan avenue provided you arent going during one of the  months of winter  It is a quick walk along the river and there you are  The river is a neat walk anyways  It is very convenient for the theater district with most within  or  blocks  You are closer to the museum campus than most of the Michigan ave hotels but it is still probably a cab ride on most days of   dollars Overall very solid stay  Ive never had a bad experience there and put it a couple notches ahead of the other hotels Ive stayed at for pricevalue  This includes Trump Westin Blackstone Hilton riott and Res  Inn downtown  
P => Fantastic Service and River View but a few negatives In a word the Renaissance front desk staff is outstanding  They are unfailingly polite helpful cheerful and go above amp beyond to assist  The location is superb being convenient to both the Loop Mag Mile and all buses and trains  There is no sight more beautiful than the view of the river from one of the river view rooms  The view alone is worth the price of the stay even at the outrageous convention period prices  The bedding and basic comfort is satisfactory  Rooms are very quiet although you can hear the most obnoxious conventioneers talking loudly to each other as they return to their rooms in the wee hours  Internet is day per computer There are some negatives none of which are any fault of the staff but rather the fault of the people responsible for the interior design and maintenancerenewal of the structure itself  The operation of the heatingAC system in our room was unreliable  And an icy cold draft at the window ledge prevented sitting there in the evening to enjoy the view without a blanket The water temperature in the shower is erratic constantly going from hot to cold to hot to cold so that you really have to shower with one hand close to the faucet for immediate adjustments  One colleague had very inadequate water pressure in their shower but got moved to a room with better facilities  There was almost no storage for clothes and misc items  You get a closet and two nightstand drawers thats it  Theres no dresser or any other storage except two tiny drawers in the minibar  On the plus side there is a ent sized room safe although the metal edges are so sharp and rough you have to be really careful if you store a wide laptop in it to avoid damage  One note of warning the hotel restaurant is a dismal disappointment if you like your food properly prepared and served  The Starbucks in the lobby is great and if you like Chinese dumplings the Wow Bao in the lower level is extremely affordable   per dumpling two are sufficient for lunch if you want a quick bite  Oh and I should mention that while our room was exceptionally clean and well kept another colleagues room had dust on every surface  be a room that has been empty awhile should be rechecked before allowing the next guest in  In closing I would not hesitate to stay at the Renaissance again if a river view room was available because the staff is also so wonderful but given the lack of storage space and annoying shower you really have to consider places like the Sofitel where your room will have not only more conveniences but also many little luxuries and trouble free showering  
P => Great Place to Stay In Chicago We had a wonderful stay at the Renaissance Hotel  Its close to the subway so its a breeze to get from airport to hotel  We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Chicago River   what a delightful way to spend some time in Chicago  We spent every morning and evening just sitting and looking out over the traffic on the streets sidewalks and river  Service at this hotel is wonderful rooms are comfortable location simply cannot be beat  A great place in every single way  
P => Great Location for exploring Chicago Stayed in a  bedroom suite with husband and  year old child for  nights  The suite was huge and had plenty of room for our little one to play without getting under our feet  The hotel has a great pool area and spectacular views overlooking Chicago River  The location was perfect for exploring all that Chicago has to offer with the Trolley tour stop across the road and boat tours  minutes walk away  My dhters favourity memory of Chicago was buying Garretts popcorn Cheese and Caramel mix which is around the corner from the hotel  The concierge was extremely helpful with tips for sight seeing with a small child which made our stay even more enjoyable  
P => Beautiful and Great Location We really enjoyed our stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel  The location cant be beat It is on the Chicago River and our room was right across State St from the Chicago Theater  The room was clean quiet and spacious  The rate was very reasonable and a great value considering the location  We very much enjoyed the pool and hot tub  We would definitely stay here again  
P => First rate hotel  Nicely positioned overlooking river  Close to public transportation  Large well orated and clean twin room  Coffee machine in room  Reasonable price for the quality of the hotel  Friendly and helpful staff Restaurant nice but menu does not change   thus we ate out most of the time  Nice swimming pool amp jacuzzi  
P => Loved it Stayed here for NeoCon  and cant wait to return  Great location great staff good food on site and the rooms were very clean and comfy  My only wish is that we had a room facing the river but that was our own fault for waiting to book the trip  
P => Excellent room exceptional location and clean   staff not so much We stayed at the Renaissance for a trip with my dhter for a trip to American Girl and other shopping  It was a great location   close to everything Rooms were clean spacious and quiet  Pool was a little small but did the job My major complaint was the concierge service   they were clueless There idea of help was to draw a dot on the map and sent us on our way  When asking to get a menu from a nearby restaurant    she printed it out and then said quotthis is all I can give you   the printer cut it offquot and walked away  All I want to know is when you get off work wher do you eat Only locals know where the good stuff is   right She finally said a lot of people go to Giordanos   let me tell you as an Italian american I was offended by the quality of pizza   disgusting Tasted like cardboard like a frozen pizza that I paid  dollars for  absolutely awful  how do you screw up pizza The next night we ended up at Catch  next door was really good  An absolute must is a homeage ginger ale at Bao Wow   I still miss them Get a bus pass for the length of your stay you wont be disappointed If you are bringing children we saw quotAladdinquot at the William Shakespear Theatre at Navy Pier and it was worth every penny 
P => Fantastic Hotel with great rooms We have just returned from visiting Chicago and Milwaukee and spent a fantastic three nights at this hotel  This is a typical high end riott brand Hotel  The service at reception both on arrival and departure was fantastic with friendly and efficient staff  WE had a river view room on the th Floor which gave terrific views across the river and downtown area  The room was enormous with two large queen beds and a large bathroom  The room was spotlessly clean and well presented  As usual with riott the bed and pillows were so comfortableThe hotel is in a great location and is within easy walking distance of all the attractions and the downtown loop  The Sears Tower Willis Tower is with a visit but we found the lines to be long when we visited and had to queue for around  minutes  By contrast we visited the Hancock tower the following day and found the place almost deserted  There were no queues and only a handful of people at the top  Both locations offer fantastic views across the city  If you are travelling to Chicago we would highly recommend this hotel   its great value in a fantastic city  
P => Great location and amazing river view Booked this hotel in lieu of the riott Mag Mile Im a riott Rewards member based on TripAdvisor reviews and Im so glad I did For starters this is a beautiful property and every staff person we encountered especially Kelli and Bill at the front desk was helpful and accomodating  The best part in terms of being a tourist however is that the El StateLake stop is right outside the back door of the hotel   this made travel tofrom the airport a breeze along with all of our sightseeing travels as well  Large room with a bay window that opened overlooking the river bathroom was spacious as well    a wonderful reprieve from the hectic city at night  
P => Pleasant comfortable hotel in great location Large chain hotel but very comfortable pleasant surroundings and staff  Very well located for business and good for tourists too  Great selection of restaurants nearby  
P => Scenic river view in the heart of Chicago  I highly recommend the Renaissance to anyone looking for a great stay in the Chicago area  It is perfectly positioned in Chicagos South Loop Theater District  Everything is just a short walk away  I recommend requesting a River View room as the view from most downtown Chicago hotels can be a bit bland e g  skyscrapers construction etc  The staff at the Renaissance is top notch constantly exceeding my expectations  The rooms are fairly spacious and well adorned with a comfortable modern or  If youre looking to go on a weekend getaway in the Chicago area give the Renaissance a try  I assure you you wont be disappointed  
P => Nice Hotel clean great location comfortable room This hotel was everything it aspired to be a clean business friendly classy hotel in an excellent location  The rooms are comfortable staff friendly and lobby swanky  The hotel has a nice pool and the fitness center is ent  
P => Amazing hotel in perfect location Minus the puke filled elevator To begin I travel quite extensively for business and pleasure  This hotel is perfect for both types of travel  Rooms The rooms are beautifully laid out with very comfortable beds and roomy bathrooms  Our room overlooked the river with no obstructions on the th floor  If you can request a river front room I would strongly recommend that option Food There are many places to eat in this city  We went to an AMAZING Argentine restaurant near Wrigley  It was called Tango Sur    The food was right on the money for Argentine taste and the atmosphere is great Remember to bring your own alcohol is you go because they do not have a liquor license  There is a CVS down the street which oddly to our surprise was well stocked  A great French restaurant is Avec      Chicago  This is a different type of restaurant but well worth the slightly higher prices  They have an amazing sparkling rose wine  They will recommend you order slowly take this advice You will be surprised how quickly you fill up Brazilian Steak House Restaurant   Fogo De Chao      Chicago     is a mustHotel Service Room service was prompt coffee was great fruit plate was fresh and muffins were tastey  A bit pricey but expected by a riott hotel Recommendation If you can go during baseball season make sure to go to a game at Wrigley Field  It is always a good time and you will enjoy it with tremendous pleasure Flaw We were there the th of y weekend so it was busy as expected  On one of the nights we arrived back to the hotel at around midnight and as we began to walk into the elevator we were hit in the face with the rancid smell of puke  Someone had thrown up quite extensively in the elevator and no one had cleaned it up yet  I am unsure how long it was in there but it covered the entire elevator  It was horrible and I would never expect something like this from a riott hotel  So this was our discouraging moment of the trip Also the pool is very very small  As is the work out facilities  If you get stuck inside due to rain as we did for a day the pool will be packed with people only about  people fit in the pool area  If you think it  rain bring some videos to watch  
P => Great Location This hotel is in a great location on the Chicago river walking distance to shopping parks sightseeing and great restaurants  i would not discourage anyone from staying here  the rooms were large and comfortable with great ble bathrooms  I gave it an average because the services I used were just OK  The front desk was always busy and understaffed the concierge seemed tired of dealing with tourists and although very hot outside the staff could not seem to keep the large server of water filled  But the location and rooms were more than adequate  
P => great Lovely hotel great amenities   would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to my friends and family  
P => Great for Chicago Getaway This great hotel is directly across from the Chicago River so definitely spend a bit more for a river room   it will be worth it and you will have a full on view of ina City the famous corn cob buildings and of course the river itself including the Mies Van Der Rowe IBM building and the side and backside of the Wrigley building among others  The staff are very nice the bed very comfortable and checkout was a breeze as we had bags packed for two weeks and called up the bellman who put our bags in a car for our return trip to the airport  The hotel is next to the El elevated rail so getting around is a breeze  Its likely to be a bit more expensive than the average hotel but if you get a high river room view it will be worth it  Location is fantastic as you can walk north across the river for access to jazz and blues and great restaurants in the evening and during the day you can go south for culture if on holiday or on business  The hotel has a touch of elegance for a fair but not ridiculuous price  
P => Outstanding Hotel I loved this place so convenient to everything shops restaurantsattractionssubway  Comfortable rooms big bathrooms loved the granite countertops the light in the closet and the nightlight in the bathroom  The computer in the lobby where I checked in for my flight and printed my boarding pass was so convenient  I would absolutely stay here again  
P => A Great Choice That Will Keep You In The Loop The first time I went to Chi town I stayed at a nice but far flung hotel in one of the suburbs  This time e  I stayed right in the Loop at the Chicago Renaissance and man what a difference that makes This hotel is adjacent to the StateLake CTA Station the quotelquot and the Blue Line to OHare is only a short walk away  The hotel fronts the river and it seemed anything I wanted to see downtown was just a short walk away  I got a super deal on this hotel by booking in advance on their website using the AAA Rate  The hotel was very clean very modern and the room was comfortable with big European pillows on the bed  The staff was very professional and extremely helpful despite the size of the place and huge number of guests  They let me store my bags while I cht a Cubs game over at Wrigley Field  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and hope they keep offering good deals online for those of us who shop early  On my next trip to the Windy City this is the first place I will check for ratesavailability  AWESOME hotel  
P => Lived up to Expectations Read the reviews on TripAdvisor before booking  I stay at riott a lot on business so used points to book  nights when my son and I went to Chicago to catch a Cubs game  The hotel is in a great location in the heart of downtown on the Chicago River  We walked to Navy Pier on Lake Michigan about  min walk  The red line subway is  block away which will take you to the Cubs or White Sox games  The connsier was outstanding  There was a Harry Potter exhibit at the museum of history and industry  She recommended it after asking my son  if he liked Harry Potter  Great idea  Allof the staff were friendly  The last night it rained so after returning from a day exploring we rented a movie in the room and ordered room service  They have a childrens menu  each which is unusual in nicer hotels  Food arrived in  minutes  There is an extensive breakfast buffett each morning discount for children again  Overall id stay here again on business or pleasure 
P => Convenient to EVERYTHING We flew in to Chicago Midway airport and took the CTA Orange Line train right to the hotel There is a CTA stop StateLake literally at the back door of the hotel and the train ride is a snap at only   per rider dont take a cab  Very nice  Check in was easy and quick  We booked the hotel trough PRICELINE COM and got an awesome rate thats why Im giving it a good valuew rating  We ended up in a KING room on the st floor looking right down the river  Again very nice indeed  The room was clean the bathroom spacious and my wife loved the complimentary robe  The Renaissance is within walking distance of just about everything in Chicago so if you come to the city and really want a CENTRAL location this place has it covered  There is a nice exercise area and this hotel actually has an indoor pool fairly small sauna and hot tub nice for soaking after walking the city all day  
P => Location location location The Renaissance seems like any other big business hotel but its location sets it apart    the north edge of the Chicago Loop right across from the river and a short walk to Michigan Avenue  It has great restaurant choices right nearby a Starbucks in the lobby and you are steps from shopping and corporate offices like United Airlines and the Boeing Company  Its or is standard if comfortable the hotel staff is friendly and provided me with a fridge  Watch out for pricey wi fi although your code can be used in the lobby and that bottle of water on the desk will cost you   Also self park around the corner in the same garage the hotel uses and save  a night  
P => Good centrally located hotel I spent  night at the Renaissance while on business Room The hotel is obviously a little older however the rooms are large and the or was clearly modernized very recently  I booked a corporate rate of night before tax which seemed very reasonable to me for a downtown loop hotel in Chicago  Bed was comfortable and included enough pillows that even I could find one that I liked  Favorite things about the room hotel is   non smoking and has good bathroom amenities i e  mint thyme shampoo  Negatives TV has no HD channels Staff Check in was fast amp friendly  Front desk recognized immediately that I booked a corporate rate that included free internet and even managed to get my bill correct the first time upon checkout  Wake up call was received promptly and made by an actual human a luxury these days     View amp Location of Room I had room   which is on the back side of the hotel facing west and had a view of virtually nothing except the top of what appeared to be a convention hall a parking garage and a residential building across the way  As I was in the room strictly to get some sleep this wasnt an issue for me check in at pm out by  the next morning  If you are light sleeper you  want to consider asking for a room on one of the higher floors as the elevated trains run along Lake Street immediately south of the hotel and can be fairly noisy Location The hotel is located very very centrally to both River North i e  Magnificent Mile shopping and the Loop  Its basically  blocks east of Michigan Avenue if you walk along the river  The hotel is roughly  blocks from the ClarkLake subway stop which has access to all lines both elevated and underground except the Red Line  Inbound I took a taxi from OHare which ran me about  with tip  Outbound to OHare I took the blue line which only cost me   and was certainly faster about  minutes in rush hour traffic  Food As it was late when I got in I used room service for dinner  A club sandwich with fries ran me   including all fees and taxes  Delivery was prompt amp the food was hot upon arrival Overall the Renaissance Chicago is a very comfortable hotel for both business and pleasure and I will certainly consider returning on my next trip to Chicago  
P => Loved Windy City And Its Renaissance Well we ided to go to Chicago on New Year holidays and this was my first visit to the Windy City  I enjoyed it very much   and to a great extent due to my stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel  As known the first impression is the most important   so when I entered my one bedroom suite on the top floor and looked through the windows  W O O O O O W The view it was fantastic Great Mighty Powerful Striking Overwhelming   all these epithets could hardly describe my silent excitement and proud of the talented people who created all this urban architectural beauty for succeeding generations  Just in front of me there was a bridged river and on the top of its multilevel banks   the shining newly built Trump Tower famous funny cylindrical twin  corn  towers as well as Chicago Tribune building and Michigan Avenue in remote  The whole city center is on your palm   really cool and unforgettable I did a right thing when had chosen the Renaissance instead of the riott in Magnificent Mile cause the last one s location is rather trivial  Besides the beautiful view I was very much impressed by the suite s home likeness you know  Relaxing colors of the walls and carpets soft armchairs and coaches lovely commodes and cupboards flat plasma screens in each room small fully equipped kitchen a nice ble bathroom with all the amenities including robes and slippers etc   all these features made my stay truly comfy  And in general the premises are nicely orated the lobby bars reception area got many interesting artifacts including vases lamps bookshelves tables and other elements of professional design  Saying about the service I d rek that it s regular  Anyway to sumize the hotel s advantages and disadvantages they re the following The pluses The room cleaning and turndown service are at a very high level   The Front Desk staff are awesome  Due to the concierge s absence I  terrorized  them daily with a billion of questions concerning the city maps sightseeing entertainments locations routes restaurants weather etc  and every time got sincere and appropriate assistance  And one day I was talking by phone to a guy from a ticket agency that had not delivered prepaid tickets to me on time and that guy spoke so fast like a machine gun that I couldn t catch some important nuances of his  explanation   So I asked a receptionist to help me with conversation and he took my phone and started  translating  to me from live English into English for foreigners  Thank you again guys so much The hotel s restaurant is very good  I had breakfast and dinner there almost daily and can admit that the service is outstanding  The food is delicious  Besides its premises got a nice panoramic city view especially at night lights   The breakfast at executive lounge is rather sufficient  For coffee lovers there s Starbucks inside the hotel   There s a taxi stand at the entrance with ready to ride cabs all the day round  Limousine service  Excellent price The minuses The thing that struck me most was the absence of the Concierge service at all during the whole period of my stay   that looked ridiculous for the hotel of such a brand as well as The absence of an internet terminal while on vacation many guests don t carry laptops with them for checking their mailboxes out just a couple of times you know and I m not an exception The mini bar service is slow and sporadic   without a phone call the used drinks could have not been refilled for days  And of course the US riott s general principle that executive lounges are closed on weekends though in Europe and Asia they are open daily  That doesn t matter for business travelers but vacationers staying in executive rooms as well usually arrive on weekends  Nevertheless despite the aforementioned drawbacks of a limited partial character that obviously can t spoil the general positive impression of the hotel I d like to conclude that I truly liked the Renaissance Chicago and surely am ready to stay there again but next time in summer   with a river boat architectural tour and Chicago skyline small cruise ship dinner  Concerning what to do in Chicago in winter   some stranger s tips  Magnificent Mile  It s enough a half day walk to get your wallet empty and to relax for the whole stay afterwards   Broadway musicals   a very small choice but worth visiting   Chicago Institute of the Arts   unique institution with unbeatable collection of French impressionists   a must   The Field Museum  very impressive bigger than its NYC famous rival   Lyric Opera   highly recommended    Navy Pier   fun and attractions  Nice views of the Lake of Michigan  It s a whole sea guys now I understand why these lakes are called Great   Sunday brunch at restaurant on the top floor of Hancock Tower   a must   Millennium Park   Observation k of Sears Tower   Chicago Black Hawks andor Chicago Bulls at United Arena   a must  Bon Voyage 
P => Practically Perfect In Every Way We stayed at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel on ch   for a one night stay  Upon arrival at pm the valet was overwhelmed I guess too few employees working for the volume of guests arriving  After a wait our car was taken and we entered the hotel  The hotel has a beautiful clean spacious lobby with a waterfall and a very serene feel  We were welcomed at the front desk with no wait by a very effective and friendly employee  Our assigned room was  on the th floor  We highly recommend this room It was at the end of the hall very quiet away from the elevators etc  and had windows on two walls looking out onto State Street  The views were incredible of the Chicago Theatre river and even Lake Michigan in the distance  The room was large and spacious very clean and well appointed  The bed was comfortable the bathroom was large everything was wonderful  The rest of our stay was perfect until we went to leave the hotel  The valet was again overwhelmed and didnt seem to know where our car was parked After a  minute wait our car was finally located and we departed  The hotel was great  The valet service was not especially for the   fee we were charged for parking at the hotel  
P => Nice Big Rooms In The City We stayed at this hotel for the second half of our trip to Chicago  The first half we stayed at the riott Mag Mile  The rooms at the Renaissance are nice and spacious in comparison   not a typical city hotel room size  Room had seating area and  bedroom both with large bay style window facing river   great view Also one half and one full bath with  tubshower  Bathrooms were also quite large  It is walking distance to pretty much everything and is situated on the river with great views  We ided to valet  usd because they told us that if you self park it is like  or so dollars less but you  do not  have in and out privlege   we were planning on driving so it was just easier to valet   There is a quotspaquot which is a shared area with the pool fitness center steam room and lockers all shared    I think the lady said they only had  treatment rooms  Everything was new and very clean  Good equipment in fitness center and pool was clean as was steam room  Concierge lounge was a step above the regular riott as far as food quality and service  We had dinner one night in the on site restaurant it was a two for  pre fixe meal steak veggie salad desert and bottle of wine that actually was quite good  We loved our time in Chicago and when we go back this hotel will be our first choice  Mainly because of the large rooms river views and concierge service  
P => Top class hotel with great rates Fabulous opulent looking hotel for regular rates   makes you feel special 
P => Great Views Awesome Upgrade Very friendly staff upgraded us to a huge corner suite overlooking the riverlake amp State St iconic Chicago Theater sign and sent us a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary  We had a great stay and definitely recommend it for a night in Chicago  
P => Convenience and Comfort This is the nd Renaissance hotel I have stayed at recently and I have to say Im enjoying these properties  They really take care of you and service really seems to be a top priority for this hotel chain  I was given a really nice end room with two large windows facing the Chicago theater  The room was very spacious contemporary and clean  Theres a whole mini mall attached to the hotel so you dont have to walk outside in the freezing cold     theres a small little store attached that serves Starbucks or you can walk inside the building and find a whole Starbucks store Theres a neat little fastfood like dumpling restaurant thats great for a quick bite The location cant be beat     i could practically walk to all my meetings  There was great shopping nearby and the L stops were there too even though i didnt use it I really enjoyed my visit  I would totally stay at this hotel again for business or pleasure  
P => Great Stay at this downtown Chicago property I had a great stay at this downtown Chicago property  After arriving early into Ohare from a red eye from San Francisco  Check in was smooth and fast  I received a room on the top floor and music was playing when I entered the room  The room was was good size with plenty of lights  The bathroom water pressure was good as was the temperature control  The bathroom was clean The bed was comfortable  The room was cleaned well every day  I asked for quiet room though the property is next to the elevated train the noise from the train did not bother me  There was a mini fridge in the room which was a plus The onsite restaurant was excellent  Also the concierge lounge offered good snacks and breakfast  This propert is very walkable to many downtown sites  There are two Dunkin Donuts around the corner as is there a drugstore McDonalds and Borders I highly recommend this property  
P => Great Stay My wife and I stayed here for  nights in ust for a company incentive trip  The entrance to the hotel is exquisite and very impressive  The staff is very friendly and the concierge is very helpful Good location we walked almost everywhere  Just across from the river our room had a great view and everything was very clean comfortable and modern  Taxis hang out just down the street and it never took more than  min to get one from the bellman  Walking distance to the major shopping areas amp great restaurants but it s a little far from the Lake and Pier must take a cab or public transportation  
P => Fantastic Hotel We went to this hotel as part of a group getaway vacation for couples  The hotel is gorgeous the rooms very nice and the location was great  I know this  be a strange thing to comment on but the lobby smelled great  We used riott points to stay there and it was well worth it  Weve stayed at other Renaissance hotels but this was one of the nicest  Also theres a Lettuce Entertain you restaurant at the bottom called Wao Bao  If you like Asian food definitely give it a try especially the curry chicken  
P => Windy City Oasis I stayed here a Thursday and Friday night in early ember  The hotel was orated for Christmas and looked very nice  The check in was a breeze  My room was a very nicecorner room   As previous guests have noted the trains can be heard all the way up the back side of the hotel  I for one did not find this a problem at all  be its being from NYC the noise was not bad  Its not honking horns type of noiOSITIVES   Nice newly reated rooms with large flat screen tvs  Ipod Docking stations  Bathrooms were very spacious and had nice amenities Concierge Lounge had good selection for breakfast foods and evening appetizers  Location   this is right near it all basically from tourist attractions to retail stores and good restaurants  There is a Borders bookstore next door as well as Macys and other big stores  Cabs were always waiting right outside and the train stop is next door too  Concierge recommended Naha and ia restaurants for our two nights there  Both were outstanding   highly suggest you check these out  Naha was walking distance  ia  minute cab Lobby bar was very nice with good wine selections NEGATIVES  As previous guests mentioned   night for parking and I had a weekendFriday night stay  Seems a tad high  Also a weekend thing the concierge lounge is closed Friday night to Monday morning  No offer for a free coffee in the Starbucks or restaurant  Overall this is an above average hotel with a high standard and delivers high ks with customer service  
P => Nice place in the heart of town I stayed in Room  on ober     Lets start with the good stuff  Check in is very easy and friendly  The hotel is very pretty and clean  The rooms are big and clean  The new TVs are nice  The safe in the room is a big bonus  Elevators are very quick  Work out room and pool are excellent  Hotel is close to a ton of great stuff  You wont go hungry with donuts sandwiches coffee bars etc very close to the hotel  I suggest the Corner Bakery just down the street   You are walking distance from the Sears Tower and Millenium ParkThe only negative  I was on the backside of the hotel where the train tracks are  The train is very loud late at night and early in the morning  Suggest a room at the front of the hotel or away from the tracks  You will sleep better  
P => Beautiful View of the River I stayed at this hotel because it was hosting a conference I had to attend for my doral program  When I arrived the front desk staff was wonderful I was exhausted from having been travelling for  hours and they made check in an absolute breeze  I even got a room upgrade to a Club Level ior Suite with a river view because the hotel was sold out on the night I arrived   this was pure luck I know  The rooms were very well appointed and the beds are comfy and soft though not quite as comfortable as the Hilton Hyatt or Starwood properties I have stayed at  The view was great and the hotel lobby was beutiful and comfortable just to hang out in  I highly recommend just sitting at the bar and socializing or doing some people watching even if you dont drink  I dont drink and I still had a great time  This hotel is in the heart of downtown and the bar has one wall that is all windows so you could just sit and take in the views  Directly across the street from the main entrance is the Chicago River Walk so you dont even have to go to far to take in the local sights  Almost all of the biggest down town attractions are within walking distance of this hotel a major plusThe concierge desk will also give you a great list of local eateries and pubs if you are interested and they have lots of discount coupons for you as well  If clubbing is your thing they have lots of VIP passes to local clubs you just need to ask  On the whole all of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly  My only complaint about the entire hotel experience is that they keep the place pretty cold even after I bumped the temperature in my room up to  degrees it still seemed cold  Also on the down side if you plan to drive in parking is a whopping  per day    All in all this was a very nice hotel with great staff in an awesome location  I absolutely recommend it  
P => Love the Renaissance The Renaissance has changed its image from a standard hotel to what they now call an quoturban sanctuaryquot    and this label could not be more true  The reations they have made include a fantastic and comprehensive fitness center stretch room and pool area  Additionally their restaurant and lounge are excellent and the rooms are designed with everything that a guest seeking a quotsanctuaryquot would desire The best part of this hotel however remains the staff and the service  Everyone at the Renaissance goes above and beyond and truly has the enjoyment of the guest as the top priority  The only downsides to the Renaissance are that it is difficult to get a cup of coffee before  am and they have started spraying this very pungent scent throughout the lobby that caused some problems with my fiancee who is very sensitive to various odors  Above all however the Renaissance is a fantastic hotel that I would recommend wholeheartedly  
P => Just OK I stayed at the Chicago Renaissance for a conference for work  When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the lobby was and check in was a breeze  However other than those two my stay was just ok  Nothing wrong but not great  The room is pretty spacious for being in a city and the bed was very comfortable  However the bathroom while nicely appointed had a funny smell  It came and went throughout my stay as if it was coming from a vent to another room Also while the TV was nice flat wide screen the picture still came in fuzzy which was weird  Not enough to ask to change but it was weird  Also I had to ask a few times to get any packages that came for me the conference was in the hotel  This is likely a reflection on the banquets department rather than the bellhop  The good news is that the location was very convenient with quite a few restaurants within a five minute walk and a cute cafe across the street for a quick breakfast  Next time I am in Chicago and have a choice of hotels I wouldnt choose this one  There are just too many other better choices in the same price range  It was fine but for the price should have been better  
P => Wonderful Place and Convenient Going to Chicago regularly I have stayed in a wide array of them including Park Hyatt Four Seasons Hotel Monaco and others  The Renaissance is best for service convenience and internet access  In addition the bargain cost is a plus for those not on expense accounts My request for a certain room and number of beds is always honored  The front desk staff is always friendly    even in the most challenging of times  checkout  and always greets me by name  The high ceilings of the entrance and lobby and comfortable seating area makes it a pleasure to just hang out or meet with or for business colleagues  And its proximity to downtown as well as public transport makes this a hotel that can also be used for vacations  Biggest beef is the fact one must pay for Internet service  While at Courtyard riotts one gets it free one must ante up   for it here  This is a standard practice at quotbusinessquot hotels but one would think it would go the way of the dinosaur when even European business hotels  as well as tourist hotels  have started including it I consider this hotel number  in Chicago after trying at least  different sites in Chicago and always stay here if I am choosing  
P => Overall great experience LOCATIONGreat location Right off the river close to Millienium Park and south end of the Magnificent Mile  Great shopping in area and on State street too  Right across the street from the StateSlate metro stop too  You can take metro from airport to this hotel with  transfer in about  min  hr ROOMSGot a nice room with modern furnishingsbathroom and overlooking the river OTHERConcierge lounge was well stocked  I think there was free internet there too Overall great experience 
P => Excellent hotel property in Chicago Great value for what you get  Clean and comfortable rooms  I travel on business and this property is in a great location in Chicago  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had all the amenities you need including vanity mirror hair dryer nice soaps and shampoo  TV was the standard hotel variety  Ventilation system worked great but a little noisy when the fan was blowing  I would highly recommend this property to both business travelers and tourists  
P => Renaissance is my favorite hotel in Chicago Ive been going to Chicago on business for about a year and I always try to stay at the Renaissance in Chicago downtown with budget permitting  I have a frequent guess status which is a plus  But the things that I like about it over the sister hotels and even the Starwood hotels in the same area are very good pool and workout area that was free Starwood charges a fee great clean updated modern rooms staff was always friendly lobby was beautiful food at club lounge is great and free shoe shine service The Renaissance is my favorite hotel in Chicago  
P => Nice surpise great overall Have stayed at some Renaissance properties that were not that great in the past  This property was fantastic   rooms are big great views of the river walking distance to various places friendly staff and great food  
P => Very Nice Hotel Very good experience at this hotel Great view of the river and new Trump building  Staff was VERY nice Rooms were very clean and comfortable beds  
P => Beautiful room   minor glitches I stayed at the Renaissance Chicago for  nights in mid e as part of a conference  I booked my hotel through the conference then contacted riott directly to make sure they had my Gold number  When I checked in I received an upgrade to a much nicer room on a higher floor   so all in all I got a great value for my money The hotel is conveniently located   only a  minute walk from Manificent Mile and Millenium Park among other sites  Ive stayed in other hotels in downtown Chicago and found this to be one of the more versatile locations for seeing a lot of different sites I stay in a lot of hotels and in particular a lot of riotts  While this overall was a beautiful newly remodeled room and a lovely stay there were a number of small things that detracted from   guest satisfaction  Heres the ones I can remember now  hairdryer not in room when arrived late at night had to request and then wait up for it to be delivered  room serviced xday   of course every day except for the one when I had showered later in the day and wished for fresh towels Several days they took away the bath rug on the floor too which was just wierd   TV only got about  channels in regular analog service despite the fact that it was a beautiful flatscreen TVWhile my room had a great view of the city and the lake I stayed on the th floor in a room that overlooks the quotLquot tracks  I could hear the train noise from the th floor  I suggest that if you are assigned a room on a lower floor that overlooks the tracks that you asked to be moved to the front of the building instead All in all Id definitely choose to stay here again  
P => Great hotel in downtown Chicago Very nice hotel  Great downtown location  You are within walking distance to theaters shopping and restaurants  The staff is great beds are great and room was very clean  
P => great We stayed here for christmas  in a suite overlooking the river and the trump building side The room was wonderfull the service was great and personal the lounge was good and the staff were always very friendly and hgelpfull we really enjoyed this stay and will return when we go to chicago again  
P => A Great Stay Attended a Conference at the Hotel  Got a fabulous room overlooking the ina City Towers Trump and the Chicago River on the th Flr   The staff was great queen beds were firm and pillows the best Location is fantastic being close to the CTA trains and the buses to everywhere One thing I was disappointed in was the Hotel does not offer any free Internet access in a Business Office except for a Terminal right off the Check in desk for printing Boarding Pass which was OK Will stay again in the future but will shop for best rates  
P => Very nice I stayed at this hotel on business for a few days in   and I really enjoyed my stay  Upon arriving my room was not ready yet since I got there rather early and the front desk person was super helpful and arranged for my bags to be stored and took my cell phone number to alert me when my room was ready  He also recommended a place around the corner for lunch which was very good  I was barely through my lunch and he called to let me know my room was ready it was very quick  I was impressed because being cynical I did not expect anyone to call but they did and very promptly and politely I should addSo I returned to the hotel after lunch and retrived my bags and finished checking in  My room was at the end of a long corridor and faced the rear of the hotel  The room was really nice I enjoyed it  My two quotcomplaintsquot and I wouldnt even call them that were the noise of the quotElquot train even though i was on the th floor I still heard it loud and clear every few minutes   it sounded like a strong wind blowing that is what kept coming to mind  It didnt interrupt my sleep but I can see how it would effect some peoples sleep overall  I found it soothing because I like quotwhite noisequot when I sleep  But I wish now that I had asked for a front facing room those cost more I think however  My other issue was the bathroom door which is set up to automatically close   it cannot stay open on its own  Its annoying A colleague who was also staying at the hotel said she rigged it by opening it all the way and then opening the closet door so that the bathroom door could not close  I did this too and it helped   of course I closed the door when I needed to but also I was in the room alone so I wanted to shower with the door open to relieve the steam  Lastly speaking of the shower and be this is just me I had no idea how to turn it on ha I thought you would just turn the handle and the water would come on but on this one you have to PULL the handle out and then turn  It did not say this anywhere so I thought the handle was broken and actually called maintenance   I was embarassed when they told me I simply had to pull the handle first  It sounded like they had heard this before or at least I am going to tell myself thatOverall a beautiful hotel with a friendly staff in a great location in Chicagos Loop  Lots of little cafes and stores nearby   convenient for little necessities or sundries  I would absolutely stay there again without hesitation 
P => The place to stay I am thrilled that the Renaissance is now completely NO SMOKING I dont see the need to stay anywhere else when Im in Chicago  Im so sick and tired of still being able to smell cigarette smoke drifting into the vents of rooms that are supposedly no smoking Omni Suites Chicago  Renaissance is in a great location great views friendly helpful staff nice sized clean comfortable rooms  
P => Great stay at the Renaissance My husband and I just spent three nights at this hotel in celebration of my birthday  We chose it because of the good reviews and the location  It did not disappoint  Check in was smooth and friendly  Our room located on the rd floor was clean and comfortable  We had a nice view of the river to the left and Lake Michigan in the distance to the right  The king bed was comfortable with nice bedding  There was a chair and ottoman and a work table desk with two chairs as well as an armoire for the tv  The windows opened which is always nice in high rise hotels so as to let in some fresh air  This hotel was in walking distance to many of the local attractions including Michigan Ave Macys the former shall Fields several theaters the boat and trolley tours Millenium Park and the Art Institute  We did take a cab to the Field Museum as it was a couple of miles and raining  There were numerous restaurants and stores within walking distance also  We did have breakfast each morning in the hotel dining room  It was fine nothing special and a little pricey but convenient  There was also a Starbucks in the lobby and another one a short walk away We got a good rate using AAA and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Loop area of Chicago  
P => Great Views Great Location Good Rate ent Room As a riott Rewards Gold Member I choose riott brands when traveling so I did do a lot of comparison shopping or looking for deals The hotel is situated in the heart of Chicago on the river  We were given a room on the nd floor with a spectacular view of ina City and the new Trump Tower The hotel lobby is unoffending but totally forgettable  The lobby level lounge is good with furniture arranged ideally for relaxed conversation  The second level has the main restaurant and the meeting facilities  All of it is entirely forgettable and in need of a reation  However for a weekend getaway it was fine The guestrooms and guestroom corridors look as though they did have a recent reation  Its all Renaissance standard but the room was a nice size and te or was nice  The bathrooms were spacious  However the spring hinge bathroom doors were down right irritating  I dont need a bathroom door to automatically close  It was very annoying and caused the bathroom to get incredibly foggy and damp The location is ideal for business as it affords very easy access to the business district and the el  Easy walking distance to Grant Park the beautiful Millennium Park the overrated and crappy Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue  Personally Ive been to Chicago many times so it gave me a nice home base to wander from  Taxis were readily available and it would take great effort to actually get lost tryin to find the hotel  Taxi from airport to hotel cost  You wont be wowd by the hotel but youll have a very good stay  
P => excellent service Stayed there for a conference and got a good rate with the conference discount  The staff was really nice and the location was great  Spectacular views and amazing beds  I left my phone charger in the room and they found it and sent it to me overnight Highly recommended  
P => Great Experience once again Always dependable   always a great experience I was in town for a conference and while everyone else stayed just blocks away at the conference hotel I ided to avoid the crowds and the noise and stay at the Renaissance  The experience starts at the entrance where the valet quickly took my luggage from the trunk and opened the door to the hotel    a smile at the front desk and a welcomed hello The room was fantastic the people where polite and service was great  Wouldnt think of staying anywhere else  
P => Nothing Special I stayed here for two nights on business  I was booked on a club level floor but unfortunately faced the back of the hotel where the quotElquot is located  If you book a room here be sure to request a room that faces Wacker Dr  so you can avoid the sound of the trains  The best part of my stay was probably the Club Level lounge which provided snacks and drinks  The rooms were orated in updated fabrics and colors  Bathroom had ble sink but there was no tub in the bathroom  I think they were trying to go with a Eurostyle feel with just a shower stall and curtain  I wasnt impressed with that feature  I had a king bed which was comfortable enough but Ive slept in better beds at other hotels  Overall this is a riott when it comes down to it  They do try to be more upscale but Ive stayed at better hotels  If you can afford the splurge my colleagues noted the Peninsula was a fabulous hotel  
P => Great location   a few quirks I stayed here with my family for an extended weekend while visiting family  The hotel is located right on the Chicago River convenient to the Loop and Magnificent Mile  Our welcome was warm and there was no wait to check in  Our request for two connecting rooms was cheerfully granted  The lobby is pretty and the rooms on the th floor were clean and in good condition  They were however on the dark side  Even with all lamps on the rooms were uncomfortably dim  It was gratifying to see the hotel uses compact flourescent bulbs   I just wish there were a few more of them  One odd quirk was that the bathroom doors do not stay open but slam shut  I like to keep the bathroom door open at night with a low light on especially for the kids  As a result we had to call housekeeping for doorstops  Breakfast which was the only meal we ate there was a ent buffet with an omelet station and the usual buffet fare in a room with nice views of the city  There is a Starbucks downstairs if you just want to grab a coffee and a paper For those highly sensitive to urban noise be warned the El train runs right behind the hotel and our rooms while on a high floor overlooked the tracks  You can certainly hear the trains rumbling by even on the th floor  I usually travel with a white noise machine so I wasnt terribly bothered by it Id definitely recommend this hotel for business travelers or tourists with the above caveat in mind  The staff was friendly and we had no difficulties other than the bathroom doors  
P => Very Enjoyable Renaissance Stayed at the Renaissance for a conference in early ch   Hotel is located very close to El Train and Subway connections State and Lake which is good for travelers coming from Midway and those going to Wrigley  Michigan Ave is a few blocks up but the subway can get you there a little quicker on a cold day  Dinning options are plentiful in the hotel and around the area  Fitness center has everything you need  The pool was nice but very cold for an indoor heated pool  The rooms were very nice with comfortable beds oversized chairs and a large well lit bathroom  One gripe about the room though has to be the size and location of the TV  The TV is placed rather high on an armoire and it cant be more than a  quot set  Other than that the hotel was great I would recommend staying here for business or pleasure  
P => The Best Hotel In Chicago Period The large room on the club floor had a spectacular view from two huge windows  We could see both the Chicago River and Lake Michigan  The room included two very nice chairs three small tables nice artwork a large desk with two chairs and great lighting from several lamps  The room had a large closet with an automatic closet light that turned on as the door opened  The room included a mini bar which we did not use  A large cabinet included four small drawers and also doubled as the enclosure for the mini bar  An old fashioned surprisingly tiny  TV sat on top of the mini bar  Forget trying to catch football or tennis highlights on such a small TV for a huge room  The fitness center and spa is top notch  Equipment includes free weights treadmills and more  The fitness center also includes a swimming pool with a lap lane  I swam about forty laps but as usual for hotel pools the water temperature was too warm for a swim workout  The hotel is close to the L and a short walk to shows  We won free tickets to Wicked which had hourly drawings from Borders right down the street from the hotel  The front desk manager was very professional and gave us free breakfast coupon since the concierge lounge was closed on Saturday  The restaurant looked nice but we didn t eat dinner at the hotel  
P => A Great Experience Just returned from a  night stay at The Renaissance and had a great time  We were there for a girls get away  Everything about the hotel was great from the moment we arrived  The whole lobby smelled wonderful and check in was great  We upgraded to the Club Level but be aware that the lounge is not open on the weekend  We had great rooms that were oversized with great views of the river however we did see another room on the same floor that looked just like a standard room  Everyone in the hotel was super friendly and accommodating  The rooms were clean and the beds really comfy  Turn down service is not what I would think but only a minor issue  We got our shoes shined and turned around within  minutes  They give you a bottle of water instead of charging you   for it which was nice at night  The fitness center was very nice and clean  Everything about the hotel was great  The concierge Ikram was the best  She helped us so much with show tickets dinner reservations and even getting a prescription called in for one of us  She was the best  Overall I would stay there again in a heart beat  
P => Understated Luxury in Downtown Chicago The Renaissance is probably one of the nicest hotels in downtown Chicago  I have enjoyed their service twice now and each time has been an excellent experience The hotel is probably five or six blocks from Magnificent Mile and a short hike to Millenium Park  The hotel has a constant stream of cabs to take you to more distant attractions and there is an El stop about a block from the hotel to get to and from the airport or out to other parts of the city Inside the hotel the lobby is very nice  Service at the desk is as prompt as can be expected when there is a check in or check out rush  The concierge services were good when I used them in my previous stay The fitness facilities are quite large for a hotel or at least many hotels Ive stayed at and all the equipment was relatively new and included free weights as well as cardio machines  It can get crowded as there are litterally hundreds of guests that could potentially be using it but no worse than my normal gym back home Room service is prompt  The only issue I had was addressed quickly  They missed part of my order and the attendant must have had a cellphone on him to call down because it couldnt have taken more than  minutes for the rest to arrive The rooms though and specifically the beds are what make the stay  The Renaissance beds are as comfortable as if not superior to the Westins  The furnishings are in good order overall  The room sizes however vary slightly  Remember this is a downtown room so it  feel a little smaller than normal  My first stay had me in a smaller room  The second was in a corner room which was definitely larger Given its location service and quality of the rooms it was worth the  I paid both the first and second times  You might be able to find a better rate booking further out but closer in  seems to be the price of entry although it is not out of line with what youll find elsewhere downtown Overall I recommend this hotel completely  
P => Very nice stay My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance Chicago in   for  nights  The hotel was clean had nice sized rooms coffee makers and the normal amenities that you would expect in an American hotel  We did not try the restaurant but there was a Starbucks in the lobby that was very convenient  If you walk out the back door of the hotel you are right on a major shopping street with Macy s and a number of others stores it was a nice surprise as I was more focused on Michigan Ave  and did not even realize this when I booked the hotel  A short walk away is a nice little bakery and sandwich shop called Corner Bakery my friends and I enjoyed eating there a couple of times  The best part about Chicago though is Michigan Ave  The hotel is at the base of this long wonderful street if you make it to the other end and can t make it back call for a taxi they are every where Would I stay at this hotel again Yes  It was very nice the staff was helpful and they were very courteous and efficient  
P => Excellent Hotel Great Value I have stayed at this hotel about five or six times  It keeps getting better  I recently stayed the weekend before    The hotel was crowded but everything was perfect and service was as gracious as ever I was upgraded to one of the larger club rooms  It was wonderful  The room was huge with a large bay window with a fantastic view of the river and the new Trump Tower under construction  The bathroom had a arate large soaking tub and shower  The bed was luxurious and very comfortable  Service was excellent  The hotel offers a complimentary shoe shine service which is especially great in the winter  I called to have my shoes polished over night and they were returned gleaming in  or  minutes The location is excellent  Youre about a block or two from all of the wonderful shopping on Michigan Ave and just around the corner from the flagship Macys on State Street  The health club pool and spa are very nice  Theyve were reated last year  The equipment is excellent and they actually have a good selection of free weights in addition to the usual machines I ordered room service for breakfast and everything was delicious and served very promptly  The high speed internet service was fast and dependable  It was a little pricey but no different that other hotels Ive stayed at Chicago does have other and even more upscale choices such as The Peninsula Four Seasons Ritz Carlton with the Mandarin Oriental and Shangri la on the way  A night at one of these hotels will easily be   times the rate at the Renaissance  They are beautiful and luxurious  star hotels but its hard to justify the extra cost when you can get affordable luxury at the Renaissance I cant think of anything negative about this hotel  Highly recommended  
P => Best Hotel In The Chi I live in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and have stayed in many hotels in Chicago growing up  This hotel is by far one of the greatest hotels I have stayed in anywhere  My dad is a riott rewards member and therefore has points that have added up from his numerous business stays in riott hotels  This summer my girlfriends and I booked this hotel during the th of y holiday  Not only did the front desk give us a river view room but they were very polite and helpful  I am  years old so sometimes when a bunch of college kids check into fancy hotels such as this one we are treated like less important customers  But not here  The entire staff has been nothing but friendly the three times I have stayed in this particular hotel  The have fresh bathrobes waiting in the bathrooms  The rooms are very spacious  The beds have down comforters and you can choose your pillow type The concierge not only called cabs for us to travel about the city but also put us on the guest list at some of Chicagos hottest night clubs  The fruit water they had in the lobby and by the pool was amazing  A ful service spa spacious workout center jacuzzi and pool with skylights looking into the city are only some of the perks  The lobby barlounge is sophisticated and has wonderful tinis  From now on I refuse to stay anywhere but this hotel  I have yet to speak to anyone who has stayed there and thought anything but the best  
P => loved the renaissance     beautiful lobby and rooms this is really a great place to stay  we have stayed here many different times and have always enjoyed our experience here  The staff is great  Most times you have a view of a river even if youre not in a river view room  you a near state street shopping near the quotelquot train and there are many shops in the basement area that adjoins to hotel   nail salon starbucks kinkos just name a few A highly recommend       
P => wonderful The hotel was lovely and all of the staff that I came in contact with were nice polite and helpful The room was clean comfortable and spacious The bathroom was very nice and the bed was wonderful Paid  with a Travel zoo deal and think it was a great value I would stay again without hesitation  
P => Great hotel great stay I and my  grandsons ages   amp  spent  nights at the Renaissance Chicago  It was their first time to Chicago my first with kids  The staff the location and everything was great  I have stayed here many times before so I had a pretty good idea what to expect  We plan on returning in  and hope to be able to stay here again  
P => Great Stay at the Renaissance Our stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Chicago was fabulous We were very pleased with our accomodations as the room was clean and nicely orated  The bathroom was very nice  We have no gripes regarding the overall accomodations as they were perfect  The nightly maid service was wonderful  The only drawback during this experience was the slow check in process  There were only  associates working the counter and the line was steadily growing  The  nightly parking fee is also a downer  Otherwise this hotel is highly recommended 
P => Great location for theatre We booked this hotel specifically to stay close the Goodman Theater  We saw the Christmas Carol at the Goodman and they had a special deal with this property  The pool and hot tub were excellent to use after the cold weather while ice skating  The Goodman and other theaters were right outside the  back  door to the hotel  The House of Blues is across the river and Michigan Ave is a short walk away  The south shoreline from South Bend Randolph and Michigan Ave is a short walk to this hotel about two blocks The buffet breakfast was   a bit steep considering it was not extraordinary  However there is a Dunkin Donuts across the street out back  The concierge was very helpful in pointing out alternatives to the hotel dining for breakfast  Overall I would stay here again especially for plays  
P => Fabulous experience A friend and I recently stayed at the Renaissance for  days on a pleasure trip  my first visit We loved it   I plan on going back to Chicago soon amazing city and without a doubt I will stay at the Renaissance  From the moment we arrived the experience was wonderful  The fragrance in the lobby the gorgeous room we splurged and stayed in the one of the quotclub roomsquot th floor the service everything  You really cannot beat the location   we walked to great shopping the best Nordstrom Ive ever seen  restaurants boat tour  From our room we overlooked the river and quotSmith amp Wollensky Steak Housequot my favorite  A view that was breathtaking  The breakfast in the private lounge on the th floor was more than we expected we were told continental but it included scrambled eggs bacon and lots of other yummy stuff  The room was luxurious and spotless the bathroom large and sumptuous  I travel often and have stayed at some of the finest hotels in Europe and the Renaissance was right up there with the best  
P => Great location   close to everything downtown My wife amp I spent a weekend visiting Chicago and stayed at the Chicago Renaissance hotel at  W Wacker Drive  The location is ideal and our stay was greatWe arrived around noon on Friday and were accomodated with an early check in in a very nice very clean room with a king sized bed  Our Sunday morning checkout was smooth and painless This hotel is ideal for sightseeing visitors  We walked only two blocks to get to a hop onhop off tour bus location  We walked  blocks to see quotJersey Boysquot at the LaSalle theatre  For quotDomerquot fans wanting to take the train to South Bend for a Saturday Notre Dame football game the weekend South Shore trains depart from the Millenium train station only  blocks away  There are also downtown rental car offices within  blocks if you need to rent a car  Beware of unfriendly Avis rental car staff at this downtown Chicago location This hotels restaurant quotGreat Street Restaurantquot had a nice menu with pre theatre dinner options which were a great value compared to ala carte  Our entrees were excellent and perfectly prepared  The only downside was the wait staff that night were inexperienced although they tried hard  Other nearby restaurants range from McDonalds to Frontera Grill I am a frequent traveler and was very impressed with the quality location and service offered by the Chicago Renaissance  
P => Awesome location beautiful hotel I stayed here during the weekend of the Chicago athon  This hotel is located across from the river easy walking to the Magnificient mile The staff was friendly during check in the lobby is gorgeous  There is a barrestaurant on the nd floor with great views of the river  The room was clean and had everything we needed a small cofeemaker mini bar tv desk  We didnt have a laptop so we didnt try the internet connection  Its an easy walk from everything and would definitely recommend this place  
P => Great locationvery nice hotel Stayed here two nights The hotel is located two blocks from the EL blue line from Ohare very convenient Friendly check in staff Great lobby Double room on th floor overlooking Chicago river Very clean and well furnished large room Had to call for coffee packs as none were in the room Room was fairly quiet Bed was very comfortable Executive lounge was very nicegreat viewunfortunately not open on weekends An above average stay all in all This was my first visit to Chicagotrip report filed here      and I look forward to returning  
P => Loved the Renaissance experience We checked in late for one night at this property in Chicago  The key they gave us didnt work but after one trip downstairs they sent secuirty up to us and he had a new key for us in no time  The room we had had an incredible view of the river and the city  The bathroom was big and beautiful the or was great and after a drink at the bar downstairs we slept great in a very comfortable bed Cant wait to get back here 
P => Nice stay at the Renaissance This is the second time Ive stayed at this hotel this summer  both for business trips  The first time I stayed I got a great river view but this time I had a view of other buildings  The rooms both times were very clean recently updated and best of all extremely quiet I didnt hear my neighbors either time and the air conditioning was quiet as well  The lobby is nice staff was cordial and the bar had good drinksappetizers  There is also a coffee shop near the lobby that serves starbucks bagels etc   I usually check between this hotel and the Westin River North to see what the best rate is  Both are peaceful hotels with nice rooms although I have to admit the Westin has much more comfortable beds The Fairmont is another good choice but a little further from all the action  
P => Terrific Hotel We stayed with the Rnaissance Chicago over Memorial Day weekend and enjoyed it  We were very pleased with the location  When searching for hotels we worried this one might be too far north for us to easily reach the sights were were planning to see  It turns out that the Loop is a relatively small area and easily walked  This hotel is only a short block from the StateampLake stop of the L giving it extremely easy access from Midway and great access to various areas of the city  For scale   the Chicago Theatres sign is just beyond that stop to the south and the river is about two steps from the hotels front door  The location is within easy walking distance of the great restaurants bars and nightclubs just north of the river Our room was great   the king bed that made falling asleep after a long day sightseeing a true pleasure  Having two armchairs was great although we did have to trade off use of the footstool  The bathroom was spacious and came with a bathrobe and good smelling bath products  The hotel staff couldnt have been better  Our reception at the front desk was warm and cordial  If we hesitated at all as we walked out of the front door one of the valet swould offer to help us figure out where we were going   they gave us great recommendation on dinner one night and helped us get our bearings several times   they seemed to be genuinely interested in helping guests have a good time  I would highly recommend the Renaissance to friends  The price was a bit higher than I originally wanted to pay but it was worth it 
P => Fantastic location great hotel Stayed at the Renaissance for a convention in e   The location was great for shopping and sightseeing in the Michigan AveLoop area and handy to public transport for trips further afield  There are lots of great restaurants within walking distance too  The hotel itself was clean and well maintained and the  hour room service is great for anyone arriving on a late flight  I had a room with  queen beds and a fantastic view of the river and the ina City quotcorncobsquot love them  The room itself was a ent size and the bathroom was fabulous with an excellent showerbath quality fittings and lots of fluffy white towels  My only gripe would be the swimming pool which is considerably smaller than it looks on the hotel website   not suitable for swimming laps too shortshallow but would be good for just splashing around in  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Chicago on business and also for vacation travel  
P => Great hotel We stayed at the Renaissance for  nights in ch  the hotel was beyond expectations  The staff were personable and helpful for tourist info   We arrived very late after many delays and the staff checked us in quickly and gave us our room keys  The room were spacious and clean  Our rooms view was of the Chicago river and the theater district on the st floor  We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and they had fresh fruit great service  The quotLquot was aroung the corner for easy transportation around the city  I would definately recommend staying at this hotel and we will be returning in the future  
P => Excellent saty at this hotel Great rooms really good size for such a city Hotel very clean and has very good maintenance Location is excellent just in the middle of the best attractions Staff very nice  the only problem is that the bussines center is closed on weekends and I couldnt find a place open on a sunday to check internet as I didnt have the laptop with me  
P => Great Location Booked this trip through riott Com and stayed on Memorial Day weekend  This hotels location is great  Its next to the Chicago River the theatre district and a short walk to Michigan Avenue  Hotel staff was friendly and helpful hotel and room was clean  The king bed was very comfortable the bathroom big and bright and cleaning staff did an excellent job  We asked for and got a room with a fine view of the river to Michigan Avenue The hotel lobby bar was a great place to relax after a full day of walking  There are some fine restaurants nearby and the subway stop is just a block away  The only real improvements my wife and I would make would be quieter hotel door closers and soundproof glass  Like so many hotels weve stayed at the doors slam shut and traffic noise from the street would be annoying at times  Overall though we definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Still a good choice  I booked room for  through Neocon trade show special  Of course you have the typically high add on charges for big city hotels as well as a  a night parking fee for our car which brought the cost to approximately  a a night  I was surprised to see that Chicago hotel prices are climbing right up there with New York  And the prices seem outrageous but I suppose it all boils down to supply and demand  Spent  night here on a mix of business and pleasure  Now on to the review   LOCATION GREAT Great location on Wacker drive right on the river and just a relatively short walk to Michigan Ave and Millenium Park and several of the downtown theaters HOTEL PUBLIC AREAS GOOD The or is a bit dated but still upscale  I think its time for the Renaisance to reate its public areas but the hotel still has a luxurious feel ROOM GOOD Our room was very nice and the bed was outstanding A Room was clean and well maintained  as it should be for these prices OTHER VERY GOOD The weight room pool and spa area were all very well equiped and kept up SERVICE   We didnt have any problems or much interaction with hotel employees so not much to say RESTAURANT  We did not eat at the restaurant GreatStreet this time but weve eaten at the restaurant in the past and found the food to be very good  Nice view of the river OVERALL I have no problem recommending the Renaissance it is a top tier hotel with a great Chicago location  A or update in the public areas  be due but it is still very nice ONE LAST THING I love big cities and I must say that Chicago is perhaps the most beautiful big city in America  Clean and well kept with tremendouse architecture and many things to do  Check for free concerts at the Millenium Park outdoor theater during the summer  Beautiful big city experience 
P => Disappointing stay I stayed in Chicago doing a dors convention and my travel agent booked me at this hotel  The room rate was  and the hotel is definitely not worth the money  The room size was nice  However there was no safe in the room  The TV was over  years old and thus was neither a flat screen TV nor was there HDTV  The entire hotel is badly in need of an updating  If the iott Corporation wants to charge high rates they should provide modern comforts  I would recommend the Sofitel which is a far more modern and better hotel in Chicago  
P => Wonderful stay in Chicago It was my first visit to Chicago and I chose to stay at the Renaissance on the basis of prevous reviews on Trip Advisor  The checking in process was extremely efficient and friendly  My room overlooked the river which offered good views and was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the bedlinen was wonderfulHowever the bathroom was fine but had not been cleaned properly from the previous guest and the towels could have been softer  Also I asked for extra sugar and milk but it never arrived  I think they are rather mean on the tea and coffee supplied in the room I ate in the restaurant which overlooks the river where the service generally was fine and the food was good The hotel is extremely well located and as a single female traveller I felt very safe walking around the area alone  Everything is in easy walking distance It is not the best nor the worst hotel I have stayed in and should I return to Chicago I would definitely choose to stay at the Renaissance again  
P => Really Nice Experience I stayed at the Renaissance Chicago for two nights last month  I usually stay at the riott on Michigan Avenue but there was no availability for this particular weekend so I tried the Renaissance  I was really impressed  The Renaissance is only about a five minute walk from the riott and is located right on the river  The lobby is beautifully done and the staff were friendly and helpful The hotel gave me a room facing State Street which is the side of the hotel  I had a nice view of the river and of a K race that took place one morning  The room was nicely orated and included riotts new bedding which was very comfortable  The bathroom was gigantic and was beautifully done  The fitness center was adequately equipped with about five treadmills three eliptical machines and some dumbells  There is a small pool at the hotel as well The location of this hotel is fantastic  its only a block from the subway and is close to Grant Park Navy Pier and many other attractions  If I had to choose between the riott on Michigan Avenue and the Renaissance I think I would now choose the Renaissance  It was a little more modern the furnishings were a little newer and the room was more comfortable  Plus the rates seem to be cheaper  All in all a great find in Chicago 
P => Agree with the   point reviews on Tripadvisor Sweet hotel with emphasis on location one block from river on the corner of State and Wacker  One block from theater district Chicago Theater Ford Oriental Theater Goodman etc two blocks from shall FieldsMacys  Across the river from ina Towers and House of Blues  Five blocks walk to Hancock and Watertower PLace  Exactly   miles from Union Station bus and Amtrak we trained in and walked to the Renaissance  We had a concirege level room top four floors in this  floor building and had a back non river view which was still pleasant  The concierge lounge on floor  served up a light breakfast supper and even a night snack saving us tons of money eating out  you can only access the lounge by key card on the elevator  There is no free in room internet but the Business Center at the concirege lounge is one computer in a closet room and is available free to check emails fr a couple minutes daily many people using  Four night stay in a two queen room which had a nice shower and tiled bathroom and only shortcoming for this  sq foot room large was the soiled carpet but without any funky smells or major stains  In fact the entire hotel could use a reation of carpet alone  Otherwise sweet  The daily parking charge for this property is  a true gouge  Plan to ditch the car and fly in or train in  We will stay again when we go to a theater show  The bus to museums and Soldier Field   stops right at the door of this hotel and the L subway is also right next door  I have lived in Chicago fr five years and cannot think of a more ideal location frankly  Millennum ParkGrant Park and Buckingham FOuntain is less than   miles away  A winner  
P => Excellent Hotel Ive stayed a the Chicago Renaissance several times  This is an excellent hotel  I travel about  nights a year for business and this is one of the better hotels Ive stayed in  The rooms are well appointed and the beds are excellent  There is an option to back light the underside of the vanity in the bathroom which makes it very easy to find the toilet in the middle of the night   You dont have to wait  years for an elevator like you do at the riott on magnificent mile dont stay there   A good number of the rooms over look the river as well  The staff has always been friendly and the lounge is excellent  I find this Renaissance to be one of the better riott hotels Ive stayed in over the years  If youre a silver gold or platinum member riott typically offers a stay one night get the second night free on the weekend deal which is unbeatable at  for  nights at a hotel in this class  No matter what type of hotel you are used to staying at the Renaissance in Chicago will not let you down its a good choice hands down and deserves to be much higher in the rankings than it currently is on Trip Advisor  
P => Excellent downtown Chicago Hotel My wife and I stayed  nights over a long weekend  Weve stayed at a number of really good hotels in Chicago over the years but our stay at the Renaissance was tops  We used riott points for the stay and were given a room partially overlooking the river  The room seemed to have been recently redone  The bed was one of the best weve had anywhere and the staff was prompt to meet our every need  The property was clean and quiet  We will be more than happy to stay here in the future and will move it near the top of our list of Chicago hotels only exceeded by the incomparable Four Seasons  
P => Loved the location This is a very nice hotel with nice clean rooms friendly staff an excellent location  You can hop on the L by exiting from the back or visit the mag mile with only short walk by the Chicago River  There is shopping in the downtown area close by as is the Theater District  I had a nice view from my room  
P => A Great Hotel in the Middle of Everything My family and I stayed there after xmas and it was GREATWhen we checked in at the front desk the desk person Madisonwas so pleasant and helpful  We were tiredhungry and my little boy was sick  She got us a very awesome room recommended a great pizza place and helped us with the sickness Thats above and beyond  The beds are the best and the service is better  You are walking distance to most everything Dont rent a car like I did you never will use it and a waste of parking fee  When we go back this is the only place we will stay 
P => Great Hotel The Renaissance Hotel Chicago is a great property with a great staff We stayed there over New Years Eve and will likely stay again The staff at the hotel are first rate   the check in was speedy and accurate there was no wait for our luggage to be brought to our room and the valet was always quick with our car or a cab when we needed one The rooms are well appointed and surprisingly spacious  We had a king room with a desk and a seating area with a comfortable chair and a small table  The room had a bay window which we were able to open to cool the room down  The bathroom was updated with granite countertop and a nice large tub The location of the hotel is quite good   it is on Wacker on the South side of the Chicago River so you only have to cross the bridge on Michigan Avenue to start a shopping spree on the South End of the Mag Mile  If you go south you are just a few short blocks away from Millennium Park where there is outdoor ice skating in the winter and the Art Institute  If you cross the river and go East you end up at Navy Pier  If you are in the city to enjoy theater the Goodman is close by as is the Chicago Theater The only item I would caution you about is views   there are not too many great views in the hotel   there are   rooms per floor with a North view across the Chicago River   these are really nice views  Most rooms however do not have breathtaking views of the city but rather views of other buildings from across the street  This didnt bother us however it is important to some  
P => excellent When we bid on Priceline for  per night for a weekend getaway we were delighted to get this hotel  It is right on the Chicago River cnr of State Street   within moderate walking distance to almost everywhere  We walked to Sears Tower the Shed Aquarium and all the way up to Millennium Pier The complimentary in room Starbucks coffee was a treat as was the good quality Lather Inc toiletries in the beautiful bathroom  Pity that breakfast was  each so went a few blocks south and enjoyed quotCorner Bakeryquot instead  The lounge bar is very reasonably priced for a relaxedcasual dinner Would definitely recommend AND return  
P => Comfort With Great Location This is a very pleasant hotel clean and lots of open space in the common areas  The desk staffer was a little abrupt and disinterested on checking in but extremely nice and efficient any other time  The room itself was on the th floor and with the bay window I could see a sliver of the lake a good portion of the river and most of the Chicago Theater  My room was directly above the L but I didnt really notice noise  The bedding was nice with  pillows the room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom had a tubshower combo and granite sink area  Very pleasant  The hallways were nothing great but were clean and quiet  The hotel has a nice entry area on the river Wacker St  and is only a  block walk to Michigan Ave  The Wrigley Building IBM Center and the new Trump building are right across the river  The Magnificent Mile is an easy  minute walk across the Michigan Ave bridge  The L is immediately behind the hotel and very convenient  Millenium Park is a  minute walk  Very safe area not too much traffic and not as busy as hotels on the Magnificent Mile  I liked this place and the price was reasonable  
P => Good hotel beware the El noise I was happy with my stay  Excellent location  Comfortable bed  Spacious room  Nice breakfast restaurant  Well appointed lobbyMy only complaint is that my room faced the elevated subway the quotElquot and the noise from it was loud enough to awaken me several times throughout the night  Next time I will request a room on the other side of the hotel  
P => good hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  nights  Staff was very attentive professional and courteous  Concierge desk outstanding  Restaurant staff excellent  Room was clean and of adequatestandard size  Good King bed  Very fast elevators  Good location on the quotLoopquot we walked everywhere  Only drawback   our room on back side of hotel looked over elevated train tracks and we never got used to the sounds of the trains rumbling by  If we returned would ask for room on side away from train  
P => Great Location   High price performance ratio The hotel is located in quite a good and nice area  Everything could be reached within  minutes walkway  Hard Rock Cafe Magnificent Mile Navy Pier and Sears Tower  The hotel itself got a lousy price performance ratio  Not recommendable from this point of view  
P => Loved It Great Place  Great Location  Stayed at the Renaissance for a  night getaway  We enjoyed it Valet check in housekeeping    all A We were upgraded to a club level floor th to our surprise    big and spacious great view and quiet  Called down for the car and it was there at the doorstep in  minutes    Awesome Forgot toothpaste and it was delivered complimentary in  minutes   along with mouthwash and a toothbrush  Always called us by Mr  and Mrs  Was a bit leary going into the weekend by the previous reviews but no complaints here at all  Very busy weekend with CubsCardinals Air show and PGA in town but felt like the hotel was handling it  Besides in the lobby didnt see many guests at all  I would stay again  
P => Wonderful Hotel Great Location This was my first trip to Chicago and I am so glad I stayed at the Renaissance riott it has a great location to shopping dining and sporting events  My room was above average clean and comfortable and I had an amazing view of the river I felt like I was in Europe  Supposedly you can hear the train from some of the rooms    I didnt have any problems The hotel has a ent pool and the gym equipment seemed brand new  I didnt have an opportunity to check out the spa but I did get a good pedicure in the nail place attached to the hotel  Definately have breakfast in the hotel and order the Lobster Scrambled Eggs   they were so good I ordered them two days in a row  While in Chicago I checked out some of the other hotels   from the Hilton to the Four Seasons and I will definately stay at the Renaissance again  
P => Great experience My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance the first weekend of ust and had a wonderful time We were on the Club floor  corner room so had  big picture windows could see Lake Michigan from one of them  Lovely big bathroom sitting area  Wonderful bed and bedding Everything clean hotel staff friendly and helpful  Its not inexpensive but you get what you pay for     
P => One of The Best Stays What can I say Great staff location lobby amenities or etc  Very pleasantly surprised in my late e  stay  I also stayed two nights at the Wyndham and was not as impressed  Renaissance wins hands down  
P => Dependable luxury at the Renaissance Chicago The Renaissance Chicago is a solid dependable choice for a nice hotel in Chicago  I stayed there several times for business in    e   Overall I would say this hotel does many things very well with hardly any negatives or things that I would say are truly excellent  Dependable luxury   it didnt often surpass my expectations but it met them consistently Rooms good sized rooms nicely appointed with dark wood and leather furniture  The conceirge floor rooms floors   are about twice as large as others  The bathrooms are very nice with wood dark ble and plenty of space on the conceirge floors again huge bathrooms have arate enclosed shower and bath  Noise level for the rooms is OK  Ive never heard people and TV noise from other rooms but the hotel is next to the L elevated subway so I did hear the train faintly from my room  I also once had a room near the elevator and had a little bit of whining noise from that so if you are sensitive to noise I would recommend making sure the room is OK when you settle in  The views are generally good obviously better on the top floors but with  floors chances are you wont be blown away by a view of the lake and skyline riott downtown has great views if you can deal with hearing everything in the room next to you  I had a very comfotable king bed Service everyone has been very friendly and helpful with my requests  I have not had to call on the service very much but whenever I have they were very helpful Concierge lounge very good cold breakfast with a variety of fruit cold cut meats yogurts and breads  The lounge itself is well orated and has some good views Fitness and pool facilities the fitness center and pool were recently redone and reopened in  and they are great  The pool and hot tub look sharp  All new cardio equipment was installed each with an individual screen and headphones  They also have all new strength equipment with a pretty good selection of machines Palmer House and riott Downtown have the best weight training selections  
P => Love the Renaissance The Ren Cen Chicago is a fabulous place to stay  The front desk is helpful and courteous the rooms are comfortable and quiet and the beds are very comfortable  It is in a perfect location in the Loop and within a  minute walk of the Magnificent Mile  The concierge recommended great restaurants in the area and the Lobby Bar is a great place to spent a couple of hours  No hotel is perfect so if I had to point out some bad features they areThe indoor pool is nothing specialnight is a lot to park your carOne of the concierge was not helpfulThey missed one of our wake up callsOther than that for night you cant beat it  
P => Great hotelgreat view My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance hotel in early il for a conference I was attending  The facilities were excellent  The lobby is not too large but very tasteful We arrived around  pm and were given a fabulous room   very large with the most awesome view of the river and ina towers right across from our room  The bathroom was really nice very quiet room with wonderful bed  Fabulous location    blocksfrom theatersshall Fields Michigan Ave  We would definitely stay there again  One of the nicest hotel roomshotels we have ever stayed in 
P => Chicago Renaissance is great Just stayed at the Chicago Renaissance Hotel with my two sisters and  year old niece  we loved it Great location  large room on the club level  and the staff was so friendly  A few paid special attention to my niece and she loved it  Be aware that if you stay on the club level on the weekends the club lounge is not open  We were given vouchers and had an excellent breakfast downstairs in the Great Street Cafe  It was better than I expected since I always have low expectations about hotel restaurants  We had fun shopping going to plays eating at good restaurants and visiting the museums  We would definitely return to this hotel  
P => A Pleasant Stay and a Great Location Since weve had good experiences staying in another Renaissance Hotel we ided to stay here  It was a great choice  We booked a room with a river view and were given a room with  queen beds although we requested  king bed  Our room was on the th floor and we thought that it was well worth the extra money since the view is awesome especially at night  The room was spacious with a closet that easily held our belongings and was set up so that when you opened the door the closet light came on  Overall the bathroom was well designed with enough room to move around  One nice feature we liked was that you can set the light switch so that only a light under the counter comes on  This is great for leaving on at night so that you can see where you are going should you get up  The only thing I think that could have been better  the sink  The counter was high and the sink was set too far back making it a bit difficult for a short person like myself to use  I cant imagine what it would be like for a young child The hotels gives out toiletries  the brand was quotLatherquot  shampoo conditioner lotion soap shower cap they called it a quotbath hatquot and a boot buffer  The beds were comfortable and housekeeping kept the room very clean  During the week you get a complimentary copy of quotUSA Todayquot  Also in the lobby there are complimentary copies of the Tribune and Sun Times  We had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant quotGreat Streetquot  The food was good if overpriced  Honestly you can do better eating elsewhere  We would stay here again when were in town  The location is great  steps away from the StateLake CTA stop which made getting there from Midway very easy  
P => Amazing experience I just returned from a weekend stay in Chicago  This is such a wonderful hotel  I had the most pleasant stay at this charming propety in Chicago  First the location  Unbeatable with view and all the activities one wants at your footsteps  Second this hotel has by far the largest standard rooms in the city  I have stayed at many different hotels in Chicago and am quite convinced of this  Each room has a bay window this way giving your room extra space  The sitting area has a full size very comfortable sofa not just a symbolic arm chair with a side table  Friendly staff  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => nd stay at the Renaissance Chicago We stayed here  years ago and the hotel is showing signs of aging  Someone needs to re check the rooms for worn carpeting and upgrading the paperpaint  Our room on the th floor had a beautiful view the bedroom was clean but the bath tub needed some cleaning from the previous guest  Housekeeping came right away and gave a  credit off inroom or other dining choices at the hotel which was a considerate touch  For the most part the staff were friendly and helpful even tho inroom dining messed up with some parts of our orders  The Lobby Spa and Gym were being renated and so were not available at all  I asked the guy at Concierge for smoke free dining around the hotel and we were sent to a nice place that had a bar with smoking in the middle of the room  I was sorry we tipped our Concierge BEFORE we ate   wound up eating at Smith amp Wollensky outside and it was a windy freezing night For the daily room rate of night  on FridaySaturday   and that was a Convention rate I think next time well try a boutique hotel even tho we wont get riott rewards  The hotel needs a little revamping to keep the classy distinction  
P => If you stay dont park here you will be charged for that plus internet service  I rented a room there for  nights  thinking that well usually all people park at a hotel  if they have driven or rented a Car  As a paying customer you would not think they would charge you to park your vehicle  WRONG  Be expected to pay for that BIG Also think internet access is free think again there is a charge for that as well Next time I will look for a reasonable hotel with out all the rediculous prices tacked on Dont beleive me call them first upon staying there  
P => GREAT HOTEL we stayed at this hotel for one night while we were at a train concertthis hotel was very nice for the money we paid   a night thought travel zoo comwe were not charged for having three in a room that was nice becouse the parking is   at this hotel the theater was right there and that was greatwe walked almost everywhere we wentshopping eatting ect The door men at this hotel were great and helpful when it came to what clubs to go to this hotel is a graet place to stay for anything you want to do in the windy city AAAAAA 
P => Very comfortable hotel Our th floor river view room was very comfortable  The view was great at all hours of the day  The concierge could not have been more helpful with thoughtful recommendations and suggestions  We would definitely stay here the next time we visit Chicago  
P => Renaissance Chicago good value for the right rate   A son in college in Evanston brings us to the windy city and evirons with some frequency of late  Recently we saw the Hubbard Street Dance Co  near home in Florida and vowed to see them in their home venue at the Harris Theater in Millenium Park  And while looking for other Chicago activities for our weekend we discovered that the Goodman Theater had a David Mamet Festival and the Renaissance offered rooms at  per night for Goodman patrons  Despite a  person ItalianIndian wedding at the hotel and an orthopedists convention in town the Renaissance had a room for us at that rate without any verification that we had theater tickets when booking or while thereThe Renaissance is around the block from the theater  minute walk from Millenium Park   minutes to Michigan Avenue shopping and a restaurantBandera recommended by the concierge which was a wonderful choice for two of our meals  The hotel staff was friendly genuinely helpful no problem with early check inand knowledgeable the room cozy without being small the housekeeping staff friendly and accomodating  We had a view of the river and the lake from the th floor room which had a comfortable king bed and well appointed first class bath This is not a  star hotel  if you want the ultimate in quotluxequot go elsewhere but if you want a comfortable well located hotel with virtually all the amenities you could want dont overlook the Renaissance NB  the fitness area and pool is undergoing a reation which began ch   call to see when theyll be done If I were paying the published  a night rate perhaps I wouldnt consider the hotel such a great choice but then again I didnt do an extensive search for alternatives once I secured my reservation at   As usual I will be glad to share further observations with anyone who emails  
P => Read This This is how a hotel should be run  Efficient polite and clean  Superb BED Cramped workout area being totally redone should be nice  Perfect locale  I would definitely stay here again  There is a really nice starbucks next door in an attatched pass thru Mall No need to step outside 
P => Great Hotel in the Heart of Chicago Centrally located to many attractions  Service was outstanding Rooms were comfortable clean and nicely furnished  Couldnt have asked for more  
P => Nice Hotel We stayed two nights in the Renaissance and I was very happy with how clean and comfortable the hotel is  It would have been nice if our room was truly ready upon arrival  For example I had to call to request additional robes for my spouse and three year old as there was only one in our room waiting for us  And my only complaint was the bathroom smelled of urine  I requested the bathroom cleaned and it was scrubbed thoroughly by hotel staff  However the odor reappeared later in the day  After an exhaustive search we determined it must be the potpourri  In any case nothing about our room looked unclean or unsanitary  Everything sparkled and the or was very nice  Loved the duvet and the mattress  Location is the best part about this hotel   but I personally like to use the amenities  The ladies locker room was no Ritz Carlton  Disposable razors combs and facial products would have been nice but are not provided  The hot tub and pool were great and overall we enjoyed our stay and would return again  I expected a bit more however and was only slightly disappointed by those small things I already mentioned  
P => Nice choice for Chicago We have stayed at a number of Chicago hotels and the Renaissance was a wonderful choice  It is centrally located especially if you want to see Wicked has the most comfortable beds and a nice gym free to guests  We had a river view which was lovely  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Locals Love It As a lifelong Chicagoan I chose to stay here for my th birthday last year  The views overlooking the Chicago River ina City and the up amp coming Trump Tower were so Chicago  Now we just got back from another  night stay after seeing the play Wicked one block away  What a lovely well run hotel Its better than ever  New beds overstuffed amp ample pillows beautiful bathrooms with elegant wood appointments efficient elevators etc As a Chicagoan I have my pick of many hotels   some world class  Whenever I can I choose the Chicago Renaissance My only complaint    overnight valet parking  Inexcusable  
P => Renaissance Perfect location We stayed at the Renaissance for our th anniversary  It was the perfect location for christmas shopping  Located on the Chicago river at the north end of State street and two blocks from north Michigan street  I was able to get a really good deal thru Travel Zoo  com and when we arrived we upgraded to the th floor   The upgrade was very reasonable and it included a light dinner and breakfast plus a larger room with a view of the lake  We did not have to leave the hotel to eat only to shop  I would stay here anytime  The lobby and pool were very nice plus they have all the amenities  Loved the Renaissance  
P => great location My wife and I went on a last minute getaway to downtown Chicago  We chose the Renaissance because of all the good reviews and we got a fairly good rate  Staff were all friendly and were very accomodating  We have a LARGE corner room which was nicely orated and comfortable  We were concerned about the city noise and found it to be very quiet    except for when they slipped the bill under the door at am    whoever it was was carrying a two way radio which had the volume turned way up    it woke us instantly and we could hear him working his way down the hall  We also inquired about late checkout and was told pm would be the absolute latest  Starwood and other hotel programs usually will let you do late check out at pm   riott should offer this benefit as well    for their frequent stayers    overall    for locationpriceserviceamenities   not a bad choice   I would go back 
P => Top Notch Hotel Staying at the Renaissance was a wonderful experience  Every employee I encountered was friendly welcoming helpful and smiling  They went out of their way to make sure my stay was great and provided excellent service  The hotel room was quite large  Bathroom spacious with great smelling products  The bed     LOVED the bed generous pillows and fluffy down comforter  I didnt want to get up in the morning  Would definitely stay at this hotel again 
P => Loved the Beds Loved Loved Loved the beds  Everything was very clean  The room was very nice large bathroom with arate shower and bath  View of Lake Michigan and the river  Great workout room  
P => LOVED the Renaissance Chicago   Why Stay Anywhere Else My first trip to Chicago was highlighted by my stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel  This is a lovely ent clean professional fun and reputable property  My girlfriends and I went to Chicago for Labor Day weekend  Our goal was to eat and shop our way through the city   and we did Staff members were friendly professional and very helpful with information and resources  I especially appreciated the waaayyyy early check in as we arrived at AM from San Diego   and a wee bit tired after the plane trip But the Front Desk Rep was very helpful pleasant and got us a room  The beds was fabulous with comfy pillowtop mattresses and the rooms were clean and nicely orated  Street noise was minimal considering we were staying in the city  The hotel is in a great location along the Chicago River and surrounded by incredible architectural wonders  The hotel is also located next to the subway and shall Fields making it very convenient for getting around and shopping  It is also a few blocks away from the incredible Millenium Park and the Michigan Ave Bridge leading to the incredible shops of the Magnificent Mile  Chicago is my new FAVORITE town and the Renaissance Chicago Hotel is one of main reasons for it I will definitely be back to Chicago and the Renaissance Chicago Hotel 
P => Gorgeous Room and Location We stayed here at the end of a  week road trip across the US and found it a superb oasis of comfort  Our family  adults teenagers had arrived by Amtrak overnight sleeper from Memphis   a very disappointing experience had booked deluxe cabins but found them sleazy and very uncomfortable   so we were more than ready for some luxury  The Renaissance is a very luxurious experience The room was extremely spacious   we had a corner deluxe with  queen size beds   as was the bathroom  The beds were the most comfortable we have ever slept in  Even our teenagers raved about them   they wouldnt normally notice something like that  The pillows sheets linen were all absolutely top quality   you could really feel the difference  We also had a superb view over Chicago and the Chicago River below us   one of the best views we have ever had  Our room number was   The hotel was busy   there was a wedding on   but the accommodation floors were quiet   we got a great nights sleep Breakfast was superb   an amazing buffet   with most unusual and delicious sounding a la carte offerings too  Service was impeccable without being in the least obsequious  Location is great right on the river  A few blocks walk to the Miracle Mile and around the corner from the main shall Field store  A really nice area in the heart of the theatre district We had looked long and hard at where to stay for our final night and we made the right choice  It felt like quot quality for a   price  Would definitely return  Its simply not worth paying RC or Four Seasons prices when this is available  
P => Wonderful location and a pleasant time I was in Chicago for a conference and chose the Renaissance based on past stays in this hotel  I wasnt disappointed  From the professional yet friendly check in to the efficient housekeeping my stay was lovely  The room was spacious and even with a streetside view I could see the lake and the river  And it was blissfully quiet  The location is fabulous and even on the hot days I could walk just about anywhere I needed to be  
P => Renaissance is wonderful We are thoroughly enjoying staying at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel  We have a th floor room overlooking the water and ina City and the views of the Chicago River and buildings are spectacular day and night  Tyrone the concierge helped us even before we checked in by suggesting taking the train from OHare to the city it was a good thing because we could see the traffic moving much more slowly on the road next to the train  Check in was easy  The beds are extremely comfortable and the room is clean  Belgian chocolates appear on the bed at night from their turn down service  Theres an excellent breakfast buffet we ate and at night we enjoyed visiting with relatives in the bar  If you like chocolate cake and dont mind spending a forture get a sliceWe would be happy to stay here again  
P => Always a class act I have stayed at the Ren many times in Chicago and I have never been disappointed  As a riott Gold member  nights a year w riott we always get a water view room  Try to request this to avoid noise from the nearby L  All of the rooms are very large compared to rooms at many other hotels in the city  The bathroom is large and nicely maintained  There is a coffeemaker with plenty of Starbucks as well as a well stocked mini bar in every room  The beds have recently been replaced and now they are much more luxurious with puffy white comforters and tons of pillows  The staff is extremely attentive to anything that you need especially if youre nice and smile at them  We had many requests during a recent stay   we needed several ice buckets more robes and a toothbrush   and we were taken care of promptly and with great care Some people have commented about the breakfast buffet being expensive but pp in the city is actually very reasonable plus its a very good buffett  Weve had very good room service breakfast here as well  The lobby bar is wonderful with live jazz most nights and excellent drinks and service It  not be right on the Mag Mile but its a very short walk to get to all kinds of great shopping  As has been mentioned the huge shall Fields State Street store is about a block away and it has just about anything you could ask for  Taxis are plentiful from the Ren and you can quickly get to just about anywhere in the city  As for rates they vary tremendously  Try for a AAA rate if you have membership as this is often cheaper I have stayed at many of the nicer hotels in Chicago and I am always happiest at the Ren  
P => Good but not great be I get out a little more often than the people who wrote the previous reviews  The hotel is not all that much of a big deal  The hotel lobby is in need of a reation Location is good  blocks from Michigan Avenue but it is very close to House of Blues Hard Rock Cafe and a few ent resturaunts If you like a large lobby a lounge and flowered carpet this is your place The room was very nice and seemed new with good furniture and the view over the river was nice  The room was standard sizeThe staff was excellent which is very important I believe I was on the  floor and you still could hear noise from the street The AC system is set to go off if there is no motion in the room this is ok if you are in Motel  but not a  star The valet was very helpfull If you like totally new hotels try the Sofitel the rooms are a bit smaller but the hotel is new and hip and very close to the Rush street scene  Rooms stay very cold  
P => Wow My wife and I stayed here last weekend  Top notch all the way  Front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful  Concierge was helpful  Room was upgraded to ior suite for no charge  Room was very clean and all furniture was really nice  We had a great view of the river from the th floor  Bellmen were easy to work with and very accomodating  Location was great for the theatre and shopping  This is the rd time we have stayed here over the past  years and never have been disappointed We would go back here in a heartbeat  
P => Very Pleasant experience at the Renaissance My husband and I just returned from a brief trip in Chicago on e th  Upon check in I was very pleased to find that we had been given a ior Suite with a river view  This was by far one of the best rooms I have stayed in and I travel a lot It had two bathrooms a large living area a arate bedroom area and two beautiful bay windows overlooking the river one in each room  It was convenient to many quotmust see locationsquot but do make sure you bring comfortable shoesValet parking was night which is about average for the city  All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and the lobby was very lavishly orated  It was about a   minute walk to the new Millenia Park and Grant Park as well as the quotMagnificient Milequot  Overall we give this two thumbs up and would return again 
P => Had a great visit We had a wonderful stay at the Renaissance e    We checked in very early around  a m   I mentioned to the front desk clerk that we were celebrating our anniversary and he was able to put us in a nice room on the st floor with a view of the river  The room was large enough and comfortable and the bathroom was very nice  We returned from our theatre show that first night to find a bottle of champagne chocolate strawberries and a note from the front desk staff  Very nice touch  Our only problems were a slightly rude and less than helpful fellow at the concierge desk and the fact that they were changing out desks in the rooms on the day we checked in  It was a bit annoying to have them in and out of our room three times I chalked that up to an early checkin though The hotel was very convenient to the El as the StateLake stop is right next door  It was just a few short blocks to the hustle and bustle of the Magnificent Mile  It is not right in the midst of the action as it is a little way from the Museum Campus and from the shopping  It was still not a problem as everything was a comfortable walk bus ride or cab ride away  We had tickets to theatre productions and this hotel is very convenient to both the Oriental and the Cadillac  This was our second stay at the Renaissance and I would definitely return  
P => Awesome hotel great location This hotel is great I was at a conference at the Westin across thestreet but got a great rate at the Renaissance   This hotelis located very centrally    accessible to both Michigan Ave and StateStreet  Its walking distance to Union Station and on the river  Everyonewas very friendly and helpful  I did have problems with my card keygetting deactivated twice  There was also a nice gym and indoor pool Would definitely stay again  
P => Comfortable Hotel My wife and I were extremely pleased with everything about the Renaissance  The location is at the north end of the Loop by the river and just south of the magnificent mile  The El is right next to the hotel so getting to and from Midway is convenient and easy  Most of the sights are within walking distance or a short El ride away  My only concern with having the El so close was noise as mentioned in previous reviews howeverit is only a low rumble when the train passes by that sounds much like an ac unit kicking on and is hardly noticeable  We were on the nd floor so Im not sure how disturbing it is on lower floors if absolute silence is needed  The room was quite nice with a well appointed or and comfortable bed  Service was excellant with many ammenities offered  
P => Great central location This hotel was just the best location Easy to reach from the L very close to the theater district and just a block from shall Fields  The rooms were very spacious and we loved the bay windows that let you see the river and the lake  It was a newer hotel and not an older one that they revived  We had a room on the st Floor and didnt notice any street noise or the L beside it  Room service food was good and service was unbelieveably fast 
P => Big rooms near trains ask for a view of the river I was very pleased with this hotel    its around  blocks from the train that goes to the airport and right on the loop subway  Hotels in Chicago seem to be a higher standard than many cities  Ask to see if you can get a view of the river its beautiful  
P => Upgraded to top floor suite  quite happy Im platinum with riott  nights or more per year and the front desk upgraded me to top floor suite  Everything was perfect  Gigantic ble bathroom  arate tub and shower  Very classy no complaints  I travel a lot for business and would always prefer to sleep in my own bed no matter what the hotel  However if you have to travel on business this is the hotel and the room to be in  
P => Beware of Train If you really want to stay at this hotel and I found it to be nothing special be sure to ask not to be on the train side of the building  There is a train stop literally right next to the building and the sound is the same as spending the night in a train station  If the noise doesnt bother you then you should be fine  It is in a good location but so are  other hotels  And its not that great a value for the room rates  Not sure how it is managing to get so many rave reviews  
P => Beautiful  Star Hotel I took my husband to Chicago for his birthday where we had a great time  As soon as you walk into this hotel you know its a  star hotel  The service was great and the people were very friendly  We got this hotel through priceline com for  per night but i now found out we couldve gotten a hotel right on michigan ave  for way less then that so i was kinda bummed about that  Their restaurant was a little pricey for us breakfast buffet pp  There is a great Borders about  blocks away on State St  and many stores by shall Fields which is also only a few blocks away as well  So you dont have to walk to Michigan Ave  if you dont want but we didnt notice this until we were leaving  
P => Spacious and comfy   but a bit tired around the edges  Stayed for one night at the beinning of ober  The hotel is in an excellent location and is easy to get to and from everything of interest  Rooms are spacious and the bed is really comfortable  Impressed with the clean bathroom as well  Furnishings are a bit tired around the edges and showing some age  Not much of a view from our room  Not as romantic as I had hoped and somewhat pricey   Try to find a cheaper rate if you can  Not a bad place to stay though  
P => By far and wide the best We love staying at the Renaissance Chicago  The staff is always so attentive and the property is as crisp as ever  Everything about this hotel says Chicago  From the architecture to the artwork and even to the names of the suites  The rooms are HUGE for a Loop property and all of them offer swollen puffy beds for your relaxation and enjoyment  The location is also great as it is situated at the HEART of chicago  W Wacker at the corner of Wacker and State    you cant get much more Chicago with easy access by L cab or foot to any other point in Chicagoland  This is my fav Chicago hotel and I put all of my out of town guests up here because you have every option in Chicago from dining to sightseeing to clubbing at your very doorstep and when youre done you have a pristine oasis awaiting you 
P => Nice comfortable great location As a Chicago native I dont often have the opportunity to stay in local hotels  While my home was being remodeled for  days I stayed here in a king room  The room was comfortable oversized and included a full size sofa bed  The common areas and lobby are very well appointed  There is a Starbucks and snack shop within the hotel complex  This hotel is not as flashy and hip as some of the newer hotels in town but I very much enjoyed the low key nature and quietness of this hotel  I got a great rate from Priceline which made this hotel a great bargain for a  star hotel  Note that only some rooms have a view of the River  My room was on the quotLquot side but was well sound proofed and I still enjoyed a city view  
P => My Favorite Chicago Hotel Excellent location for business and sightseeing  The rooms are larger than at other hotels and the river views are beautiful  A bit noisy however if your room faces the quotelquot what with trains going past at all hours  Request a river view room instead  
P => Very good Very nice hotel  Not quite a Ritz but close enough  Only complaint my wife had was no turn down service  Great location for theaters and shopping State street or Michigan Ave  Would stay there again and price for the quality and location was good as well  
P => Excellent Ive stayed at this hotel numerous times and always find it a great place to stay  The rooms are well appointed and the staff is very helpful  This hotel is one of those rare jewels in Chicago that can be bargin if you go the riott site to book at from time to time  Ill recommend it to anyone  
P => Excellent in every way  We just got home from spending the y th weekend three nights at this hotel  Up front you should know that I am a riott Gold Rewards member and used riott Reward points for a free stay but I dont believe this effected the quality service we received   Everything about this hotel was nice  The room was clean bright well situated and located on the th floor with a river view  We had twice daily maid service including turn down service each night  Fresh ice was always found in our ice bucket each evening after the turn down service  We also received daily weather forecasts in our room  We tried room service on a Saturday morning and the food was delivered in less than  minutes and on a rolling table  No kidding  The bed was very comfortable and down pillows were provided  Loved the bathroom lighting and the stereo sound from the TV piped inwith volume control  The room was very quiet  We did experience some city noise but that is to be expected and is something we personally like  The concierge helped many many times including providing us with an umbrella for a day  The elevators were very fast which was an unexpected surprise  The lobby has a fully loaded Starbucks which provided us with a place to pick up fresh fruit and salads  Although I would have liked to have been a little closer to Michigan Ave  this hotel will be GREAT for when making a theater going trip as the hotel literally sits in the district  shall Fields on State is just one quick block away  No problems with this hotel  We loved every minute and will definitely go back  No question about it  
P => Fabulous hotel This hotel is fabulous The rooms are spacious bathroom is large with lots of extra towels  Our room was furnished elegantly  Bed was very comfortable with feather pillows also has hypoallergenic pillows available  I am extremely sensitive to odors and found no unpleasant smells at all nor did I find anything rundown about either the room or the lobby areas  Hotel is close to transportation shall Fields Grant Park the river  Staff was friendly and helpful  I cant wait to come back and stay longer 
P => Excellent choice top notch Stayed for  nights over memorial day weekend  This is a top notch hotel and for the quality and luxury reasonably priced  Great location on the Chicago river short walk to Michigan Avenue  Had a great view of the city and the river  Room service was one of the fastest I have ever used and the food was excellent  Very comfortable bed large bathroom just top notch all around  Would definitely stay here again next time in Chicago  
P => A bit down at the heels but still nice Location is everything and this hotel has it Right on the river splurge if you can on a room that faces the river in the heart of the Loop so you can walk out and sightsee right from the hotel The rooms need work   the carpet in mine was a bit run down and the bathrooms could use some upgrading  The service is excellent   when I had a complaint about room service I found a beautiful complimentary dessert waiting for me when I returned to my room later that evening  The staff was always polite helpful and especially kind about assisting me with directions   
P => Smelly hotel The reviewers that gave this hotel a rating of quotexcellentquot must not be accustomed to staying in very nice hotels  The Renaissance Chicago Hotel is old and dated with a distinctly old and used aire from the lobby to the guest rooms  The lobby is cheap and hideous looking with ugly floral carpet and couches and used warn furniture  Also there are gold fish bowls on top of the coffee tables in the lobby a very bizzare touch The worst thing about the hotel was that our room smelled really really bad  I dont want to be vulgar but it smelled like a dirty sweaty butt  The entire floor was permeated by this stinch and also by the smell of burning hair that appeared to be coming from one of the rooms  Also the quotcleanquot towels and sheets smelled very very dirty  I only gave this hotel an quotokayquot rating instead of terrible because the staff was very helpful  Our reservation was lost and the front desk staff took the time to call our travel agent and take care of the process for us  Very helpful too bad the hotel smells so bad  
P => Super access to public transportation  I love the hotel and I love its location also  Ive stayed  times at this hotel  You can ride the train in from either airport and the L drops you off about  of a block from the back entrance of the hotel  Literally you get off the train and you can be in the hotel within  minutes of stepping off the train  Also the subway stop over by the Chicago Theatre is  block away and that will take you to Wrigly Field and Boystown  The hotel staff really makes an effort to be nice and accomodating  Also the hotel is very upscale though not luxury and many of the rooms have a good view of the Chicago River  The Club Level lounge serves above average food  Its my favorite hotel in Chicago cause it has the absolute best access to the train system  If your sole purpose is to shop on the Magnificent Mile you  want to choose another hotel  Although access to the Mag Mile is okay other hotels have better access  But if you want train access from either airport and want to go to Wrigley Field or Boystown in an upscale hotel with easy access this is the hotel to stay at  PS a cab ride from Wrigley or Boystown to this hotel say at  am in the morning costs about   A cab ride to Navy Pier is about   The walk to the Mag Mile is about  minutes  
P => Id go back here again in a Heartbeat  
P => Extremely pleased with the Renaissance  
P => Renaissance is of class  
P => Renaissance Chicago a Wonderful Visit  
P => Great value on the river  
P => great view simple elegance  
P => This place is wonderful  
P =>   
P => Dieses Hotel ist einfach super      
P => Es un hotel de  estrellas  
P => 
P => Weekend Affordable and Close to ORDChicago This is an excellent hotel if you are in Chicago for the weekend and you dont mind taking the MTA into the City   minutes   If you are flying in then they have a very frequent shuttle to pick you up from ORD  And if you are driving in just for the weekend the hotel is adjacent to the Blue Line Station to get into the city  Traffic can be maddening They have an good fitness room in the basement and the pool area is adjacent with families  The only caution is that I would recommend any room ending in    you will be away from the freeway and the room is set up as a  bedroom  Many room have the TV on a lazy Susandresser arating the sleeping area from the living area  Other thing all bathrooms are modern walk in showers  no tubs    
P => My absolute favoriate in the area modern  Stayed at several different hotels in this area including Hilton Intercontinental Renaissance is my absolute favorate The suite is spacious comfortable and modernly orated  Free internet is available at hotel lobby as well as executive lounge  Its about  minutes drive from Chicago downtown  minutes from Rosemont convention center  minutes from OHara airport  Hotel rate is very good for the weekend but expensive and hotly sought after during Expo events  
P => Watch Your Wallet The architecture and food in Chicago are two thumbs up The Renaissance Hotel   OHare has beautiful rooms but if you are a light sleeper you can hear planes taking off  The shuttle drivers are very helpful and friendly  Carluccis Italian Restaurant nearby gets a  for food service and atmosphere  Shoeless Joe Jacksons is a huge sports bar   huge portions bar atmosphere The downside is the commute to downtown  The trains are usually packed so we ended up standing for the  minute ride downtown  One of my friends had her wallet stolen on the Red Line  Very crowded and she forgot to take off her backpack purse The wait to see the Sears Tower is   hours to get tickets and   hours to get to the sky k so plan ahead  Water taxis are a great way to get full views of the downtown buildings  The Pier has something for everyone but the restrooms are far apart  The Frank Lloyd Wright tours are NOT available on the weekend Howl at the Moon has great entertainment Unfortunately the server who knew we were from out of town or bartender added  beers to our bill and we didnt catch it until the next day  We contacted them but they basically said too bad  CHECK YOUR FOODBAR TABS BEFORE YOU PAYChicago was interesting but the thefts will keep me from returning  
P => luxury at an affordable price i just checked out of this hotel a few hours ago and had to write a review  for  dollars i dont think you can get much better  the hotel was very clean  rooms are large all suite hotel  the or is very modern with the exception of no flat screen tvs  the staff was very friendly and helpful  very quiet    did not hear a single airplane  breakfast was very tasty  it is a few steps away from the CTA train and there is a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport  i think   for  hours of internet is not much to ask  would definitely stay there again  
P => Excellent Hotel Overpriced Parking We had two rooms at this hotel the weekend of the Chicago athon    one room for my wife myself and our young children and one room for my parents  The hotel is nice the suites are roomy enough for families and the huge bathrooms are fantastic  The location is good if you are planning on taking the train into town for everything you do its right next to Cumberland Station as long as you dont mind a  minute train ride I knew the parking was  a night but I read some reviews online that said you could avoid it by parking in free lots around the hotel  But there arent free lots around the hotel    every lot has a sign saying that if you dont have a permit youll get towed  I didnt want to take the risk so I parked in the hotel garage Lovely hotel but  per night parking is overpriced for the location  Also no free wifi in the rooms  That was kind of surprising  
P => Excellent Hotel We stayed here in early  after a long flight from Ireland  The complimentary shuttle driver was courteous and helpful with our bags  The hotel is located quite near to the airport but noise was never an issue here sound proofing is very good  Check in was quick and efficient  Very nice front desk staff extremly helpful  Rooms are fabulous extremely clean with comfortable beds massive bathroom with really nice smellies and plenty of fluffy towels  We ate in the restaurant on  occasions and were more than happy with quality of the food and the service  Hot food omlettes pancakes etc cooked to order so its always fresh  Also had sandwich from the bar top class also  We would recommend this hotel to anyone  We choose it after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were so glad we stayed there 
P => Great Hotel Perfect Price Everything was wonderful You must stay here if you want to save a buck Best deal in Chicago 
P => Great Hotel Great Price Renaissance Suites hotel was great as always  This was our second time at this hotel and was just as nice as we remembered  Staff was friendly and helpful  Stayed in room with my parents  Large enough for two couples to have private space  We took the comfortable sleeper sofa and they took the bedroom with a king bed  Short walk from the train station  Saved lots of money 
P => ent Hotel Near the Airport and Subway This property is nice  The rooms are modern and designed like a mini suite with a arate living room and bedroom  The room has a TV   flat screen in living room and old fashion one in the bedroom  The bathrooms are nice with a modern glass shower but no tub  Room includes a very nice modern desk and ergonomic chair  The restaurant and bar offer good food which is nice if you re stuck at this property which is about an hour from downtown Chicago on the subway  Driving at rush hour can take two hours to go fifteen miles to the downtown loop  I d normally stay at the Renaissance downtown but ided to stay at this one because I had a meeting in the area   The property has a ent fitness center with modern equipment  If you re a competitive or recreational swimmer you d hate the  yard lap pool because the water temperature is about  degrees  No one can swim laps in  degree water temperature  A better name would be a wading pool which is great for kids The hotel posted a note in the room that they were doing some minor exterior work on the building during the week day     which I didnt notice because I wasnt at the hotel during that time  
P => Just what we needed after a long flight from the UK We stayed here for just the one night as it was close to OHare and we needed to recharge our batteries before setting off on a long road trip  It was perfect from the fast efficient check in through to the big comfortable room spotlessly clean and the even bigger very comfortable bed  The room was very quiet and the staff were very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants  Excellent value for money and so convenient for the airport  Highly recommended You do have to pay for parking but we expected that so it wasnt a surprise to us  
P => Wonderful Stay I stayed at the REnaissance Chicago OHare Suites during a Labor Day trip to Chicago with my kids   ages  amp  and we had a fantastic experience  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful  The service staff had pull out linens to us within a few minutes of requesting them  The room cleaner even playfully propped my childs stuffed animals up in bed everyday  I was quite impressed with the overall experience  Rooms are nice and beds are very comfortable but the pull out beds are not The hotel is very convenient to the quotLquot Cumberland station  We parked the car upon arrival and did not need to see it until we left parking was day for hotel guests in a covered garage  There is a short sidewalk from the hotel to the station and the ride into the city is about  minutes  The trains run every  minutes and I felt very comfortable doing this with my kids although Im also a very seasoned mass transit rider We had a nice breakfast on our last day before leaving  It is quite pricey thus why we only utilized it one day but the food was very good and the staff quite accomodating  There is also a very nice indoor pool that the boys used before we left  Very clean pool with a hot tub available for adults Very nice experience and I highly recommend this hotel as a less expensive alternative to pricey downtown hotels and parking 
P => Not bad but the staff made it a   hotel The hotel didnt impress me as a   hotel except for the staff    they were as helpful as they could have possibly been  We needed linens for the hide a bed    after a call to the desk they arrived in less than  minutes  Same with needing a plastic bag for wet clothing    housekeeping brought  bags to us in a matter of minutes  The staff at the front desk were equally helpful and seemed to enjoy being of service  Top rankings in this dept The hotel itself was pretty ho hum  The lobby was nice but the roomshallways th floor looked like they needed some help  The carpet was stained all over in the hallways  The room a two double bed suite is almost to small to be a suite  The chairs were pretty uncomfortable and the hide a bed was awful    the mattress was worn so much my son wanted to sleep on the couch without unfolding the bed    and he was a good quot taller than the sitting area Nice mini fridge no microwave and a great coffee maker  The bath area was nice and large tho but the terrycloth shower curtain was kinda strange the night for parking in their garage isnt necessary either  The lot on the east side of the hotel worked fine for the weekend although it  be a different story during the week I think its actually for the neighboring office buildings  Not a lot of choices around for dining although the Dominicks super ket on the other side of the freeway is very convenient  For the seventy bucks per night I paid I wasnt complaining at all  
P => Its just ok  in need of a re model This hotel served its purpose a cheap hotel right next to blue line about  minute train ride in to Chicago  I was there during a busy weekend when all hotels in the city were sold out or overpriced  I found this hotel online for a VERY reasonable rate under  while  and  star hotels IN the city were charging near  to  a night  So in that respect this hotel is a deal  Its also reasonably convenient to the train   the closest hotel to the train stop about a  minute walk a block aways The rooms are desperately in need of a remodel  Honestly they were not that clean hair dirt crumbs strange stains on floor couch and towels  It wasnt super dirty but it wasnt that clean either  It was about the level of a Holiday Inn or therabouts The front desk folks were nice  Theres not much around within walking distance for food or anything  Its probably the nicest hotel near the airport and also fine for touring in to Chicago if youre trying to save money  
P => oasis with amenities Attended conference at airport hotel  What a pleasant surprise this hotel is Way above average for cost  Suite was beautiful  I had a corner room with sitting area office area frig cozy bedroom  TVs beautifully tiled bath room good room service  Coke machine on my floor wasnt working  That is my only complaint  Hotel is in a concrete gle if you are looking for nightlife go downtown  If you are looking for a discrete luxurious stay in the room vacation  This is the hotel you want  Fly in Fly out  
P => Fantastic for Park n Fly I stayed here the night before an international flight out of OHare  I booked my room thru ParkSleepFly at a nicely discounted rate that included parking up to five days and a free shuttle to and from OHare  The shuttle service was offered  hours and was very prompt  Front desk service was exceptionally helpful with airport information The room was a spotless and spacious two room suite  The living room area had a large tv desk chair and sizeable sofa  Beautifully orated  The bedroom also had a tv  The bed was quite comfortable and the sheets were high quality  The bathroom amenities were upscale and aromatic and included shampoo conditioner facial and body soap as well as lotion  A hairdryer and magnifying mirror were also in the bathroom  The shower was amazing  huge glass walled with various water pressure settings  The towels were fluffy and soft  Also for an airport hotel it was surprisingly quiet  be it was the location of my room but I was hardly disturbed by noise even tho I could see planes coming and going  The only possible negative was a lack of dining options in a walkable distance  The room service and on site pub menus were limited and a bit pricier than expected  I would stay at this hotel again when flying in and out of OHare  While there is an el stop nearby I would think it too far for a stay involving downtown activities but it was a nice hotel all around  
P => unbeatable room staff position breakfast all unbeatable and only fiveminutes off the blue line  Excellent hotel at excellent price  
P => Very good choice if you want to be close to OHare I booked a weekend package here for my wife adult dhter and myself through Travelocity  We were able to stay in one room because a sleeper sofa was available for my dhter and arate bedroom for my wife and I   a definite advantage when Dad is picking up the tab for the weekend  Extra towels and bedding for the sofa were delivered promptly after a call to the front desk and we found the service to be very good overall We were visiting my son and his wife and didnt dine or drink here  There are no restaurants or convenience stores that we saw within walking distance I wont repeat others comments about the nice rooms and proximity to the blue line  We prefer to be closer to downtown but for the money and accommodations this property is hard to beat  
P => Great Hotel Great Price A modern and stylish hotel located close to OHare  Easy access to and from aiport via hotel shuttle runs every  min   but you need to call if you want to be picked up from T International terminal  Rooms are large and sunny with light wood finishes  Suites consist of a living room with sofa chair and an office area  TV is a large LCD affair with AV inputs that you can hook your laptop up to  The Bedrooms are also large and well equipped with a second tv CRT only bedding is high quality and the bed is comfortable  The suite has a large bathroom with huge walk in shower  In the lobby is a stylish sitting area and a small rather dark bar and a good restaurant  Key to the visit is the proximity of the Blue line taking you directly downtown in about  minutes  This makes this hotel an attractive proposition for leisure visitors  I had a great stay and at only  a night booked from the riott website it is a bargain   easily   cheaper than staying downtown 
P => Superior Location to Airport Nice Rooms We stayed two nights in this hotel just a short distance from Chicagos OHare airport  The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport that runs about every  minutes you can take the CTA blue line which is just a  minute walk from the front door of the hotel or Im sure you can call a cab too we didnt use a cab at all The rooms of the hotel are nice if a bit modern  The noise of the airport isnt bad though there is an airplane headed overhead from time to time that you can hear  For being so close to one of the worlds busiest airports its surprisingly quiet  Our room had no bathtub in it which wasnt a big deal but if for some reason you like a tub this might be an issue for you  Check to see if they have one While the hotel offers a unique dive in movie every Friday and Saturday night at their indoor pool where you can pull up a float or a lounge chair and watch a family movie by the pool in practice it doesnt work very well  First you cant listen to it because well kids are loud and pool enclosures tend to echo  Second you cant see it very well because pools need a certain amount of lighting and the hotel didnt choose to use a very powerful projector  So if you want to choose this place solely for this purpose it might not be the best choice As you might surmise the hotel isnt really family friendly  This isnt to say its a bad hotel as its not  It appears to be quite new and everything is rather nice  But it is nestled among several office buildings meaning there are really no choices for anything to do outside working hours and very few things to do even inside those hours  The buildings themselves are alongside a rather large freeway  A somewhat residential area is available across the freeway and there is a footpath across the freeway   but its a bit of a hike Because of that the lack of a tub and the design of the hotels eating facilities it is somewhat surprising that they even have a family night such as this one as the two dont really fit together  But for us the hotel served the purpose well and we could easily catch the train into town when we needed to do so  Speaking of which the best deal we found was to get a Visitor Pass    for  hours of unlimited riding of trains and buses available at a number of locations including the airport  
P => Love this hotel We usually always stay at this hotel when in the OHare area  The quality you expect from a Renaissance property is what you get Great The location is good   not too close but not too far from the airport and they DO provide an airport shuttle every  minutes  There are places to eat and drink on the other side of the highway in Rosemont about a  minute drive  Parking is in a covered garage extra charge depending on your room rate which is nice in both summer and winter The hotel is a very nice looking hotel  The or is well put together and it is clean and new  Every room is a suite with plenty of room and a pull out sofa  One of my favorite parts of this hotel is the bathrooms no bathtub but the shower is amazing and beautiful  The bed is soft and fitted with nice linens and plenty of pillows  The front desk is usually extremely helpful There is a Starbucks downstairs near the lobby and the hotel barlounge is a nice place to have a few drinks if you have no mode of transportation This property also offers a very reasonable park sleep and fly deal  
P => Modern Clean next to transit Asolutely perfect  Very modern and clean hotel  Would stay there again next time I go to Chicago  You are  minutes away from Ohare airport and  mins from downtown  You can walk to the rapid transit line CTA Cumberland  
P => Great Hotel We try and stay here every time we fly out of Ohare  Great service rooms bar food and shuttle  The rooms are large and very nice  They have covered parking and the shuttle is easy to find when leaving O Hare  
P => Short but pleasant stay We spent one night at the Renaissance OHare and found good value  Especially if you need a park sleep and fly package for an early morning flight from OHare  Note we left our vehicle for a week in the parking ramp and did not have any theft issues as noted in a different review  However we parked in the middle of the rows and did not leave anything of value in the vehicle  We checked in at  pm  The staff was energetic and courteous for that hour of the day  Our room was a suite and much more than we needed for our  hour stay with a fridge sofa TV and working area in the business side and our bed bath and a TV in the bedroom area  The room was clean and fairly modern  The bed was only average but very spacious We ate in the hotel bar  At  pm t he menu was limited but the food was okay  The service was very good  We also noticed a deli and snack area near the front desk with prepared sandwiches salads sodas and snacks which all looked pretty good Check our was fast at  am and the shuttle took us right to the terminal  They also validated our parking at that time so it was not necessary to do that on the way back  We did wait a bit on the return for pick up but on the whole the van service was adequate  
P => Excellent Stay at Renaissance We stayed at the Renaissance Chicago OHare Suites using a sleep and fly package  Check in went smoothly with a friendly front desk staff  The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable with a bedroom area and attached living room area with arate flat screen TVs  The bath was very modern with a large glassed in shower  There were nice ammenities and products in the bath  We visited the lounge area for cocktails in the evening and service was great and the quality of drinks was very good  The lobby was impressive and their Christmas orations were beautiful We used the shuttle service to the airport which was efficient and prompt  Upon our return they were equally efficient  We appreciated the covered parking area and did not experience any problems there  Although our stay was brief we would definitely go back and also would recommend it to anyone  
P => Good for pre flight night Stayed at the hotel one night before flying out of OHare on vacation  Very nice hotel but hard to find since it is set inside off of the main streets Rooms were very nice and large with good amenities  Ate at the hotel and food and service were very good  Manager immediately waited on us and spoke with us about how large the portions were  We were going to order too much food based on the huge size of portions so he was very friendly and assisted us  Waitress was very helpful also I thought this hotel was very good value and location was good for flying out of OHare  Free shuttle service was good departing every  minutes on the hour and  hour  
P => Loved this place Wow talk about really nice hotel rooms we loved just about everything  The color scheme and layout were extremely well thought out the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very spacious we forgot to ask for a room with a tub so we only had a shower but it was a very large walk in shower  The flat screen TV swiveled so you could watch TV from the sofa or while in bed  We found the hotel to be very quiet we did not hear any plane noise  The sheets need a bit of upgrading as they were not the softest  The room was quite warm we ended up opening a window for a while to get the room cooled down  The staff was friendly and the  hours convenience store with salads milk soda and other items was exactly that convenient and not overly expensive  Its right by the front desk so you just grab what you want and pay at the front desk  The lobby is very attractive lots of wood and very warm looking  The indoor pool was nice and clean  The hotel was showing a movie for families on Sat  night   You could swim and watch Finding Nemo  The hot tub was also nice and clean but very very hot I would suggest they lower the temp a bit everyone that went in was complaining about how hot it was  The pool water was very comfortable  We paid day to park but were staying using riott points so I did not mind  Others paying full price probably will mind  I dont think they should charge for parking  There was no bell staff at the entrance to offer to help with luggage etc  All in all we enjoyed our one night stay and definitely would consider returning for the right price  
P => CAUTION Park and Fly My partner and I purchased a park and fly package through the hotel for the covered parking  The vehicle was parked close to the elevator on the nd floor in a main area of the garage  The vehicle was vandelized and GPS Unit stolen from Console security coded and Sirius Radio stolen  Broken passenger windshield broken console and damaged door  The hotel and hotel parking is behind an office building and not well traveled in the evening  The parking gate was left open at least one of the evenings  The manager has indicated they have no responsbility for the parking structure  There is no warning posted to hotel guest your parking at your own risk  The manager has indicated they have had this issue before  I suggested she advise the General Manager to put up cameras or have the employees walk through the parking lot once in a while  A Police Report was filed with the Chicago Police Department  The st room we had was a hard mattress  The room on the return trip was a softer matress  I would not stay at this hotel again for a park and fly unless the parking lot was more secure  
P => Excellent Hotel Stayed  for one night  Rooms are very clean there was a living area bedroom and large bathroom   Food was excellent at this hotel service was very good  I will return to this hotel and would recommend  
P => Enjoyed our stay  My friend and I stayed at the Renaissance t th th  I loved the room with arate bedroom and huge bathroom  We wanted a tub and were accomodated  Some notablesI agree with another reviewer that the beds were really firm  We had a room wtwo double beds and both were pretty hard  Aside from that very clean amp soft linens  Flat panel tv in the quotliving roomquot that was nice  The big desk mini fridge was great too You have to pay day for in room internet although there is free wifi in the lobby The breakfast buffet at Fresh is really good  For  you get all you can eat fresh fruit oatmeal made to order omelettespancakesfrench toast bagels muffins bacon sausage   endless  We really enjoyed this and ate there the mornings that we had time  The only odd thing that happened was that the entire hotel lost power our last night there  This was after two days of horrible rain  We managed to get warm showers before leaving which was a pleasant surprise  The hotel staff was very nice about the power outage and apologized for the inconvenience  Even with the power outage our bill was still shoved under our room door for easy check out  We obviously couldnt use the video check out as there was no power but checking out took no more than two minutes at the front desk The hotel did a great job of accomodating our needs i e  bringing us a bottle opener and robes when requested  
P => Great place when flying out of Ohare We stayed here with the park and fly rate booked through a third party Web site and loved the experience  The only part I did not like was driving through Chicago to get there  Once there the parking is INDOORS  The area felt safe  The shuttle was  hours and perfect in both taking us and picking us up at the airport  PLUS the hotel is right beside the EL train if you wantneed to go other places and dont want to drive  The service was exceptional in all areas we used  The rooms were way cool and suites  No free breakfast True but overall a good deal for the price  If you dont believe me price the parking for your trip as if youd park at the airport then price the room at this hotel with the park and fly rate  Youll get the idea quick  
P => Overall A Pleasure  Rooms are nice clean and large  Only complaints on rooms is that beds are unusually hard  Not a fan of Hard bedsExcellent Excersize room with OK pool in the basement Excellent Bar Good Restaruant Fresh and Starbucks in the lobby  Parking is expensive but close and safe I have stayed here multiple times and its my sons favorite hotel Soundproofing is quite impressive considering its proximity to OHare Well most likely be back here  
P => Solid choice at OHare Ive stayed in several of the hotels at OHare and this is one of the best even better if often has very reasonable rates    Efficient check in   Great staff overall  everyone I interacted with from the shuttle driver to housekeeping was polite and helpful   Huge big rooms  The suites have a large desk that allowed me to spread out and get a lot of work done  The bathrooms are also very large   Great bedding I had a great nights sleep  The rooms also have room darkening shades which was a lot better than typical hotel curtains that gap open and let in light   Timely tasty room service   I liked that they sold buy to go meals in the lobby  I grabbed one on my way to the airport   ent fitness center  Would like it better if it wasnt in the basement but it had good cardio and weight equipment free water etc A couple of the surfaces in the room were showing some signs of age some chipped wood some worn fabric on a chair but not enough to be a problem Overall an excellent stay    a very solid choice if you have to overnight at OHare  It is a little farther from the airport than some of the other hotels but the shuttle ride is still only about  minutes and its right next to the train if you want to ride it downtown  
P => Finally a wonderful airport hotel After staying in a few other hotels by the airport my expectations were not that high  However I have finally found my hotel of choice when attending meetings by OHare  The room was very welcoming with its bright colors  And despite the planes taking off and landing the sound  proofing was excellent  The room was spacious with comfortable and yet very functional furniture  The bathroom is definitely large and the walk in shower wonderful  The bed provided a very restful night of sleep  Service throughout the entire stay was superb and the staff always friendly and accommodating  Having Starbucks downstairs and a tiny convenience store was a bonus  Parking was reasonable and it was great to be able to self park without having to go so far  Great hotel for business travelers as once you are in your room   it is very quiet  
P => Overpriced Small Rooms I dont normally stay in full service hotels and consider myself a value based traveler  I stayed here to do work travel and a special coupon This hotel was quotnicequot but with small rooms and extra  for everything  Internet was  per day using a computer cost  per MINUTE and so did printing  There was no quotfreequot breakfast of any kind just overpriced resturants  The pool and workout room were nice and well equipped  I wouldnt stay here again on my own but for those that like quotfull servicequot its at least a pretty hotel and the staff was more than accomodating  They even had a cell phone charger service where if you left your charger at home they go through the ones unclaimed by previous guests try to find a match and charge your phonelaptop that was pretty cool  
P => Top notch hotel superb value We stayed at this hotel to park sleep and fly   days parking are included so it is a good value for a trip of about a week  Extra days cost  though  This is a big hotel  Lots of airline crew were there when we checked out  Everything was very clean and very nice  probably the nicest room I have ever stayed in  The suites rooms are modern nicely orated and stylish  The bathroom includes a huge shower enclosed in glass  No bathtub  The room is nicely equipped with  LCD TVs a fridge safe hair dryer etc  There was even a copy of Newsweek in the room and a glass bottle of water  There is no kitchen however  A few quibbles  I prefer disposable cups to glass  The hotel avoids normal names for things so its hair wash instead of shampoo and something cute instead of do not disturb  The clock radio is the most complicated I have ever seen  A card placed on it helpfully suggests arranging for a wake up call instead  No breakfast is included and anything you buy will be expensive  As a high end hotel they have a tradek scent blasting in the lobby  Anyone with issues to fragrances would be doomed  I actually found the lobby design a bit lacking and sterile even though there are lots of comfortable chairs  Airport shuttles are frequent large and nice  It takes about  minutes to get to and from the airport  
P => Pleasant surprise near OHare Normally the thought of staying in an airport hotel fills me with dread  I much prefer to stay in the city especially in a place like Chicago but since I had a business meeting in a building that was literally a  minute walk away it made sense to stay close by  This comes in handy too with the unpredictable Chicago winter weather I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel  First off its pretty new so everything is very clean and the design is modern  The rooms include a living room with desk and sitting area and a arate bedroom  The bathrooms are large   Im female I always judge a hotel by its bathroom   and the shower was huge  Plus they have a Starbucks in the hotel  
P => Wonderful for park n flying families What a value For  got over a weeks worth of covered parking free shuttles and a spacious suiteJust parking at OHare for  days was going to cost us moreThis hotel really is the absolute best parknfly option at OHare The room and bathrooms were very large  For a family with teenage dhters all trying to get ready before our early flight we could not have asked for more We have stayed at other ParknFly hotels near OHare so we know what we are talking about here The pool was awesome and the workout room has a window into the pool  So I could keep an eye on both of my girls one swam and the other worked out The quotLquot is right across the street for easy access to Chicago We will definetly use this hotel again 
P => A well needed oasis When my flight out of OHare was cancelled I found myself needing a place to stay the night  My airline gave me a voucher for discounted hotels near the airport and this hotel had the best price   plus tax and fees for a Sunday night  I was able to catch the free shuttle to the hotel  I was really suprised by the warm colors and modern design in both the lobby and room This hotel is a chain of the riott Hotels so I expected the same sort of cookie cutter look I had previously seen with riott  I booked a non smoking suite with a king size bed  The room was very warmly orated with deep reds and gold  The shower was fantastic with the large open glass shower stall  I have to say that I was really wishing that there was a nice tub to bathe in after such a stressful day  The bedroom offered a bed with down comforter closet tv and cd alarm clock  In the sitting room there was a really comfortable couch foot stools large desk and office station a tv and coffeetea station  My room also offered a refrigerator not a minibar for use  I really wish that I could have stayed here for much longer and explored  The service was very fast and quite friendly  There is a starbucks located in the hotel as well as Fresh restaurant and R bar  There was also food available by the check in desk while the restaurant was closed but it was rather expensive  for a sandwhich  I would most definitely stay here again  
P => Conveniently Located and Nice Hotel My self and  colleagues were on a business trip to Chicago  We landed at O Hare grabbed a rental car and drove to the hotel  The hotel is a bear to get to during rush hour as you have to go through a toll plaza and then jump  lanes of traffic to the right to get off in time  Arrival was fine check in was polite and smooth  I do grumble about day to park in an attached garage  They give you a paper receipt that the hotel validates then as you come and go you have to feed the ticket into the slot at the non attended gate you still get charged  per night the validation just allows you to come and go    no big deal just an aggravation  Hotel lobby is nice but loud   there is free wireless internet in the lobby only   otherwise its about  night in the room  There is a Starbucks on site and a hotel restaurant and bar I didnt use  The rooms are suites   spacious and clean comfortable bedding  There is a glass enclosed shower stall that was nice but the drain was VERY slow moving and by the end of the shower I had a nice little lake built up  The hotel has a nice gym in the lower level steppers treadmills ellipticals free weight dumb bells up to lbs and some cable machines   a lot more than most hotels offer We got a rate of  night All in all not a bad hotel and very convenient to anywhere in Chicago  You are in the flight path to O Hare but even on the th floor I could not hear the planes as they landed I would probably stay here mostly because it is convenient  
P => Exceeded expectations This is a lovely hotel that feels clean and new has upscale attractive modern design and rooms that are spacious and beautifully orated  Upon entering a hotel room when the door first opens theres either an immediate feeling of disappointment or elation based on ones expectations  This room dbldbl was airy comfortable stylish roomy and gave a great welcome feeling  Theres a Starbucks in the lobby  yes  and very easy access to the airport  We would definitely stay again it was a pleasant and unexpected delight  
P => Great park n fly option We have stayed at the Renaissance OHare Suites on several ocassions when weve had flights out of OHare  Have gotten some great one night rates which includes the week of free parking  Parking is covered in the k attached to the hotel  Rooms are very large clean and well worth the price  Shuttle service is free to the airport  
P => Loved the breakfast buffet and the friendly staff I booked this hotel for our memorial day weekend trip to chicago by reading the reviews here and Im so glad I did it  Well worth the money and the breakfast buffet was awesome The restaurant waiter was so nice best service         sorry I forgot to get your name or else I would have posted it here      he was the best          The ladies in the reception were extra nice too     my kids kept switching the rooms back amp forth two times and they were very glad to offer the room of our choice           Thank you Renaissance will definitely stay there again          
P => Great hotel at OHare I normally dont stay at airport hotels but this was an exception and well worth it  The Renaissance OHare is a modern suite type hotel with a nice sitting area arate bedroom and a huge bathroom  While it is only minutes to the airport with a free shuttle it is also easy to get downtown Chicago  There is a train station about  feet from the hotel that you could get to by foot  Although it takes a little less than an hour to get downtown it is very inexpensive  Overall this was a very nice hotel at a great value  
P => Mixed Review This would have been a great location for a three star hotel the only problem is that this is a four star Overall this propoerty worked well for us  It has a wonderful location just steps away from the subway blue line cumberland station The room was clean and in order  It had everything we needed and the bed is very comfortable  If you can get a deal on your rate this is a good choice but if you want the service of a four star you  want to consider some place else  The room advertised bathrobes we had to ask for them  Our rate included breakfast but it was quotaccidentallyquot added to our room one morning  The keys are elecrtonic cards like every where else but ours stopped working several times  These are all small details but shouldnt happen at this class of property  Like I said if you get a good rate this place will do just fine The food at the restaurant was good and reasonably priced  There were towels water and fruit available at the pool  If you exit the subway skywalk in the opposite direction youll find a grocery store about two hundreed yards down the sidewalk We paid  for a week night I wouldnt pay that for this place again  But we paid  for a weekend night which included breakfast I would do that again  If you want location A  If you want service B  If you want the small details of a higher class property B   
P => The PERFECT  Park and Fly  My brother and I stayed at this hotel prior to flying out to Miami for a brief vacation  The quotPark and Flyquot rate was just excellent with  days of covered parking included in the price The hotel is new and modern and the room are excellently appointed  The beds are unbelievably comfortable with great pillows  The room included a comfortable sitting area arate to the sleeping area  The bathroom like the rest of the room was spacious and well equiped  The bathroom only has a shower however it was huge  The only minor dissapointment was that it was equiped only with a fairly basic shower and it could easily have accommodated a powerful multi head shower which would have been in keeping with the very modernistic look of the frameless shower stall  This being said if the most one could complain about is the shower then we were pretty lucky I would highly recommend this hotel and will not go anywhere else when flying out of OHare again  That being said actually I would stay here above anywhere else even when visiting the city  Full ks  
P => Perfect Overnighter We picked this hotel to stay at overnight before we left Ohare for Puerto Rico  We drove from Milwaukee and had an early flight the next day and we chose the park sleep fly option where we stayed one night and got to park at the hotel for  days  The price was all inclusive and we got a free shuttle ride to and from the hotel and airport  The rooms were extremely spacious  All of them had a arate bedroom bathroom and arate living area with mini fridge and microwave  We didnt really get to take advantage of much since we had no idea how nice this place was and was just using it for the cheap roomcar storage  We paid  for the one night and  days car parking on  nd  We did check out the large pool area and fitness center  They had free apples and bottles of water out near the fitness center  If I would have known it was such a nice place we would have driven down earlier in the day and started our vacation a day early Beds are comfy and bathroom was really nice  Place was spotless and orated very modern  Would recommend this place to anyone 
P => outstanding we stayed here a couple of years ago and ided to give it another try    and couldnt have been more pleased  Stayed at a lot of the OHare airport hotels and this is by far the best Rate was better than most competitors rooms are spacious and clean service was genuinely caring and considerate  The last time we stayed it was a bit noisy    on the highwaymetro side   so make sure you request a room on the opposite side     we did and it was quiet and comfy  Look forward to staying here again and again and again    
P => Comfy beds big bathroom Booked through park sleep fly  Paid about  for a room with  days parking  Shuttle service on time and very friendly  Room very clean big comfortable and very quiet  Restaurant was very good had one of the best salmon dishes I had ever tasted Only difficulty was finding the place to get the shuttle service back to the hotel  Make sure you know where the pick up is  They were not too detailed in where the van would be  
P => Nice airport hotel After being stranded at OHare by United Airlines I needed a place to sleep for the night at my own expense  United gave me a slip of paper to call a quotdistressed passenger servicequot and they offered me the Renaissance for   Renaissance hotels are usually nice so it seemed like a good bet Indeed it was  Excellent shuttle service to the airport every  minutes and then about a  minute ride  Very fast and friendly check in and the hotel looks sharp  Annoying double beds instead of queens but you do also get a fold out coach if youre travelling with kids  The beds were super comfortable and with all rooms suites theres plenty of space  Definitely in the top   of all airport hotels Ive stayed in  
P => Great hotel Reserved room through ParkSleepFly com  Got the room for the night before our flight and the night of our return flight  Included parking for duration at a great price  Reserved  suite for four of us and it was fantastic  More affordable than arate rooms at a lesser hotel  It really was a grand hotel  Service was fantastic except one bar waitress was horrible Entire hotel is non smoking there is a smoking area outside and around the corner of the front door We will return to this hotel for accommodations for all our flights from now on provided its available at the rate found on ParkSleepFly com  
P => Best Park Sleep and Fly for any money  I used Parksleepnfly com to book a recent trip and selected the Renaissance Chicago OHare because of the cost location and the factthat it had covered parking  This was a beautiful clean quiet hoteland the parking was indeed covered and attached to the hotel  I felt very safe leaving my car there  I ordered room service because I was alone and it was served on real china and very promptly  I would recommend this hotel especially if you are flying out of OHare and need to park your car  The shuttle was very convenient  
P => Convenient location to All State Arena and OHare I spent one evening at this hotel on a business trip  The suite rooms are very spacious and the set up was good ProsConvenient location to OHare and All State ArenaConvenient access to trains to OHare and downtown ChicagoLarge glass showerBusiness area was easy to useent restaurants and bar areasStarbucks on siteConsNo bathtub didnt bother meVery hot exercise areaUtilitarian pool area fine for business travelers seeking exercises wouldnt recommend for familiesGood value  
P => Excellent airport hotel I usually stay downtown when visiting Chicago but this time downtown rates were so high that I tried this airport hotel which offered a suite at a quarter of the price  The location is offsite from the airport but the complementary shuttles seem to run quite frequently  The hotel is also a short walking distance to a cta blue line stop which will get you downtown in about   minutes  Other than that there is nothing of interest walking distance from the hotel The suite was very satisfactory   of average size but comfortable and in very good condition   great value for the money  The whole property feels very fresh  Room service was a little disappointing in quality theres also a starbucks in the lobby and a small fridge in the suite  The highway and cta blue line tracks are just next to the hotel so theres a moderate amount of noise   you  therefore want to request a room on the quieter side of the hotel Riding the cta blue line to downtown was slow but very economical  At pm the trains were still quite full and there were other guests from this hotel and the riott on the other side of the highway riding the same train Overall highly recommended for park and fly early flights out of OHare quick stopovers in Chicago or as a budget alternative when downtown hotels are overpriced Property    Service    Cleanliness    Location Room    Amenities    Views Value  paid taxnight weekend stayOVERALL   
P => Excellent Stay   Park  Stayed here wspouse as part of the park and fly package  Its a great option since you can leave your car there for up to  days in covered parking  The suite was very clean well appointed and with super comfortable beds which is why I prefer riott  The staff was very attentive and epitomized customer service  Complimentary shuttle to and from Ohare about  minute drive  Ill definitely use the park and fly option at this hotel from this point on Great place to stay 
P => GREAT Family Getaway Our family of  spent a  day weekend in Chicago driving north from St  Louis  Our selection of this hotel was based priily on their very attractive weekend pricing their quotsuitequot arrangement and of course the indoor pool The stay was excellent  Very easy to enjoy the hotel and its ammenities  As other reviewers have noted there is a   min ride into town on the blue line  The stop is adjacent to the hotel which makes it very convenient  Since this was a very leisurely trip for us the ride tofrom downtown Chicago wasnt a problem  We did purchase the  day visitor passes for  which worked well  Note our room was on the end closest to the train tracksfreeway and I heard the train all through the night  It didnt keep me awake but I woke up several times each night The room is well equipped but not very large  We did use the sleeper sofa in the quotliving roomquot and when out the bed took up about all of the floor space  The rooms have a coffee service area which is nice to hold you over until you make it down to Starbucks in the lobby  The fridge is also handy  Most notable about our room was the quotolympic sizequot shower It was so huge it seemed you could run laps within it   My husband used the fitness room and said it was excellent We did not use the restaurant in the hotel as prices seemed too high  We ate downtown for most meals with the exception of one evening when we went to Bennigans across the street from the hotel  
P => Overall a good deal I stayed in this hotel during the last weekend of tember  It is really close to Ohare airport  So that is a big positive  Overall the hotel itself is very clean and looks to be in excellent condition  There is a Starbucks in the lobby area  The rooms and bathrooms were very nice suite setup  The  hour gym is very well kept and easily accessible  Parking is steep at  a night  It is a garage that is right next to the hotel but it seems like a bit of a scam to be that expensive  I arrived on a Friday night and the receptionist at the front counter that I checked in with was very rude and seemed like she was flustered or perhaps working too many hours  This was my first encounter at the hotel and this certainly did not paint a good picture in my mind  However after speaking with the hotel manager that was on for the night I was very satisfied  The manager apologized for that employees behavior and waived the parking fees for the weekend  I think that the specific girl at the front counter was an employee that was either having a bad day or just had a bad attitude in general  Either way every other employee that I encountered was extremely nice and helpful I did not use room service or the in house restaurant bar   so Im unable to comment about that  I unfortunately had the bad experience with the receptionist but I think that was truly an isolated incident  Parking rates are a bit steep considering the fact that this is not anywhere near downtown  In sumy the hotel itself is very nice   probably rate it around   out of   
P => Great Choice   could change a few things    We stayed at the Renaissance OHare Suites for  nights  Our family of  parents and  teens enjoy the extra room offerred by quotsuitequothotels  The suite is one room w  queens and a sofa bed  A low set of drawers w a tv on top is the divider between the two areas  Other suite hotels we have stayed in have offerred  arate areas w  tvs  The hotel still feels fresh and new and was very clean  The bathroom was large but the vanity area is inside the bathroom  sink across from an over sized glass shower no privacy at all  I expect that most families that stay in one room are like ours in that it helps to be able to have  people getting ready at the same time at a arate vanity and sink area or at least to having a shower curtain Having a room that sleeps  with a glass shower was really silly in my opinion  The sofabed linens were not in the room but blankets were quickly delivered w one call  They have a business area on the nd floor where I printed our boarding passes and that was very helpful  The restaurants were very expensive and we were very tired so we ordered take out from Bennigans across the parking lot and walked over and brought it back  Staff was helpful with directions and was very courteous  We used the airport shuttle at am and appreciated this amenity The location is about one block from Blue Line and that was incredibly convenient  We would choose this hotel again if we needed an airport location  
P => Good hotel for business I stayed here and attended a training session held for work at this hotel  The rooms were great   very large and with good amenities for working arate desk and chair etc   The front desk staff were a bit indifferent  Seemed very interested in talking with each other rather than paying attention to the task at hand  
P => Lovely indeed I stayed here with a group of friends for my th birthday  We were able to get our rooms right next door to each other and were even upgraded to executive suites  The rooms are clean and comfortable and quite spacious It is conveniently located next to the blue line for easy transportation back to center city  The front desk was SO helpful with directions especially for all of us who werent familiar with the Chicago area  
P => Great Hotel This was our first visit to Chicago so we didnt know what to expect  We wanted a hotel which matched our needs and we found it  The Renaissance was a comfortable hotel had a free shuttle from the airport and the breakfast using the quotStay for Breakfastquot rate made a great start to the day  We didnt want a car in the city and we didnt need one    the Blue Line train was a short walk away from the hotel and although admittedly it did take a long time to reach downtown Chicago apparently they are working towards fixing this  We were here for  days a  day train ticket cost us  each    great value In a city like Chicago all hotels are going to be expensive so we chose to stay close to OHare where the rates are cheaper and we think we had great value for money  There didnt seem a lot to do in the immediate area but the hotel served meals which we didnt try except for the breakfast and if you are using the hotel as an overnight before a flight or a base to explore the city the lack of surrounding restaurants or entertainment wouldnt be a problem  Ok so its not in the heart of the city but what it lacks in central location it certainly makes up for in comfort cleanliness and accessibility  The reception staff are excellent too   on arrival we asked the best way to get to the White Sox stadium and almost before we had closed our door the same receptionist was at the door with a computer printout  We wouldnt hesitate to stay here again or recommend this hotel to our friends  
P => The shuttle to the aiport was great  My husband and I did the park and fly and it was great  The shuttle ran on time and when we returned we called and they came with in  minutes  We were in the international terminal  The room was great and it had a couch too  The shower was very big  Our car was parked in a covered garage  We will use it the next time we fly  
P => Great airport hotel We used Parksleepfly com to book this hotel  A great deal  A wonderful large and clean room for a great price   for  days of parking free airport shuttle and hotel for one night  The staff was very friendly and informative  The hotel is a very short walk to an quotLquot stop with easy access into the city  The shuttle employees were very nice and even made a special stop for us to get drinks and snacks at a little store down the street 
P => Go someplace else If you use Trip Advisor much you  know how many reviews I write  I travel significantly for business and write a review after almost every stay  I stayed at this hotel with my family  rooms total and this by far was my worst experience all year  Here is the text of an e mail I wrote to their business sales manager and director of operations  It sums up my experience Molly   You have a tough job  I booked  rooms for a family get together this past weekend at your property and we don t plan on ever coming back  While you re e mail is addressed to my father in law because he came in on Thursday I m the GOLD riott member  I ll be platinum later this year I m platinum with Holiday Inn and Silver with Hilton  I can tell you for a FACT your hotel is the WORST property I ve stayed at all year  On Saturday I spoke with the manager twice about all of the hotel problems and nothing of substance was done  The manager even told me he d have the Front Desk Manager contact me when they came in because they had more seniority  No contact was ever made If you care to improve your property here s some pointers Train the front desk to acknowledge the reward members  All the survey s I get from riott ask this question your hotel didn t say a word I had two rooms in my name and you placed us on the th and th floors  I thought be the property was so booked that s all that was left but my brother in law checked in after I did and was placed on the th floor  He had the same room type as our room on the th When my teenage son was making his bed up he found only a blanket in the  extra  bedding packet  A call to your service line resolved it but we never should have needed to make the call  We ve stayed in numerous properties where he s used the extra bedding and this is the first time sheets were missing Whoever ided  cool  and  warm  are good choices for HVAC obviously never stays in a hotel  Not having a digital HVAC system is a disgraceI did not have a morning paper You charge for the internet another disgrace  Charging for the internet is similar to the  energy  charges hotels tried several years ago  This  look like a money maker now but travelers remember when properties take advantage of them via fees  This is an unjustified fee and will come back to haunt you in the long run Our room had a wet spot on the floor between the beds when we checked in  Saturday morning there were no towels for the pool  I had to wait more than  minutes after asking the front desk The hot tub in your pool area didn t work After returning to our room from the pool Saturday morning we found over a half dozen insects of some sort on the walls and ceiling of our room  The on duty manager captured them in a cup for your maintenance staff When we started to shower up on Saturday morning the tub handle fell off  I showed this to your manager on duty and maintenance staff when they were removing the bugs from our room and they promised to fix it  A simple screw is all that was needed  The job was never completed The manager on duty suggested I e mail john Harper with my concerns which I ve done because this property is an embarrassment to the riott name  However your staff through their inattention to my issued has created a significant amount of ill will  When I check into a riott property I have a set of expectations  Those expectations are based on my pervious experiences at riott properties  All that I can conclude from my experience is that Mr  Harper doesn t  know how to manage a hotel or you have serious staffing issues  Either way something needs to change if you plan on succeeding  Many people will try your hotel because of its proximity to the airport riott name etc  Anyone who has the experience our group does will never come back  
P => Loved it Great hotel  Excellent locations not that far from Rosemont theater Donald E  Steven conventation center Ohare or Chicago Downtown Execllent service   
P => Great room I stayed one night at the Renaissance Chicago OHare Suites e   I took the free shuttle from the O Hare airport and I was waiting  min before the shuttle showed up to take me to the Renaissance Chicago OHare Suites  When I was going back to the airport the shuttle was in time and it worked very well  I stayed in a standard room with a king bed  It was clean fresh had a safe it was large enough for me the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was very big and it was good water pressure in the shower  It was very quiet and I could not here much from other guests at the hotel  The air condition was quiet and worked very well  The room had two TV s with enough channels and it had a nice sofa as well On the premises it was a good restaurant and a nice pub  The lobby was large and you could have a seat there and relax  The staff was very nice and the four elevators were fast and efficient  I asked for a late check out and it was no problem  The only small complaint I have is that the internet access at the business center was rather expensive  I was very pleased with my stay at Renaissance Chicago OHare Suites and I would not mind staying here again  
P => Great hotel We stayed at the Renaissance for three nights and took the El downtown daily  We were able to get a room through Priceline for  a night plus  a night for parking  Even considering that we were  minutes away from the downtown loop it was well worth it to stay here especially at the great per night price we had The El was just minutes from the hotel and the El and the buses are SO easy to use in Chicago  We bought the three day pass for  per person and used the heck out of it  We never waited more than  minutes for transportation and usually it was way less that that Our room on the th floor looked exactly like the candid photos that other reviewers have posted  We loved the spacious new bathroom and the comfortable beds  Having a suite was a big plus too  There was ample drawer and closet space two closets The ONLY thing that we didnt like was the orating and that  just be our personal preference  The living room section was very impersonal and cold in our opinion  As another reviewer mentioned it looked a bit like an office waiting room  The bedroom didnt feel quite so cold We would definitely stay at the Renaissance again especially if the price differential was sizeable between a hotel downtown and the Renaissance since the commute wasnt bad at all We didnt hear airplanes even though they were taking off directly over the hotel  DIdnt hear the highway or the El trains either  We didnt hear anything 
P => wonderful experience stayed during Memorial Day and would agree with other past positive reviews  Positives   staff was great nice new rooms wonderful beds only doubles and not queens available  tvs sofa bed nice bath great poolsaunawhirlpool in basement lt min walk to El which is  min to loop  neat mint shampoo  Negs   lots of kids that weekend who took over pool  have been isolated incident parking is  fridge not very cool  would definitely stay again  
P => Expected better a little too office like LONG review Recently stayed in this hotel for  nights over Memorial Day  The hotel is  stories and is located next to I  the El train and about  mile from OHare directly in the flight path depending on wind When I arrived I was greeted by the nice staff at the front desk and given a room on the Club Floor Room   Upon entering you are in the living area of the room  There was an arm chair  little square tables a sofa sofa bed desk chair TV and a mini armoire that contained a little refrigerator and an in room safe  The Club Lounge would be closed for the weekend so I was given coupons for a free quotfull servicequot breakfast  This room faced west toward OHare  Something bugged me about the living room but it took a while to figure it out  The bedroom featured a king sized bed another TV and a closet containing an ironboard  clothes steamerrefresher and a robe  The bathroom was fairly large with a stall shower no tub that was at least   feet x   feet with a hand held shower  The problems with the shower are that  the door opens out so the water gets all over the floor   there is no handle on the inside of the door  no place to sit to shave your legs ladies and  it is kind of dark Plus unless you are about a size  the robe wont fit And as the day went on I noticed several other things wrong with the room  Honestly I had higher expectations of the Renaissance based partly on the other reviews here and I was let down The carpet had  very large stains on it just inside the door  The door itself was difficult to open and close  In the corner of the shower there was a lot of mold on the grout between the tiles near the floor  Water pressure was minimal water pressure at best the toilet seat was very loose and the AC smelled of mildew all the time  Wound up keeping it off most of the day  There were crumbs on the floor between the tables and the furniture was really beaten up  The table was cracking and the desk had big gouges on it and on the legs  For a Club Level room  the place was really not up to riott standards  At this point I finally realized what I disliked about the living area  The way it was set up made me feel like I was sitting in someones office Hard to explain but I was really not comfortable The bed part of riotts new bedding package was fairly comfortable but neither the feather bed on top of the mattress nor the comforter were very fluffy and full  These both need to be washed and fluffed  Honestly I have had regular blankets that are thicker  Yes it is getting warm out but I like to have a cold room and then a nice fluffy down quiltI gave the front desk the list of problems with the room  I really hate moving rooms but the gal insisted that I go eat breakfast and stop back for a new room  Breakfast was another story  The coupon said quotfull servicequot meaning I should be able to order off the menu  Well I was told I had to get the buffet  It wasnt bad  Actually my omelet was cooked in real melted butter and it was very good  But my server did not ask me if I wanted toast or an English muffin there was no toaster as is standard for riotts nor did he get me Orange juice  I did get a little shot of strawberry smoothie which was good The buffet had eggs bacon cold and soggy sausage fruit cereals oatmeal and cream of wheat breakfast potatoes with peppers and onions of course yuck and some muffins and coffee cake  The coffee cakes really looked to be of the Entenmanns or Sara Lee variety like you get in a grocery store  Why They had those tell tale aluminum foil cake pan ks on the side  Eh  The chef was very nice the server was just OK Returned to the desk and was moved to room  which is one of the corner suites  Looks just like the photos on the riott website except there are no drapes just  types of shades a sheer and a black out shade  The sheer shade in the bedroom would not go up This room was very large  The living area was the size of a large hotel room itself Closet TV dining room table with  chairs a stereo and lots of speakers I guess you could use it for some sort of surround sound but I am not so inclined desk couch and arm chair  It s funny though there is no lamp close to the sofa for reading There is a big ceiling lamp over the dining table and a desk lamp but nothing close enough to sit and read at night  Hmm  At the risk of sounding mean riott needs some women designing their hotels  Or at least people with common sense who actually USE their hotelsThe bedroom had a king bed TV another closet and some drawers  The alarm clock even has directions The bathroom here had an actual tub with the hand held shower  And on the inside of one of the doors a lovely dirty kids handprint Great This is supposed to be an even better room and the housekeeper doesnt check the inside of the doors Details people The robe in this room was thick fluffy and of a size that would fit most normal sized humans At least this room didnt have that mildew smell from the AC  The view was nice  You can see the Chicago skyline in the distance  And you get to see the highway and the El The hotel is very noisy  Not so much from other guests but the trains cars and planes can get on your nerves  I can live with airplane noise but if you are a light sleeper ear plugs are a MUSTThe quotwired for businessquot package for internet and local and long distance domestic calls is   per day which isnt bad  Parking is  per day  Food prices were a bit high for dinner  Some of the drink prices in the bar were reasonable  They had some featured drinks that were   and considering the amount and types of liquor in them this was a reasonable price  One had Patron tequila for which another riott charged  a shot This stuff is super expensiveThere is a Bennigans across the parking lot and the hotel is a very short walk to the Blue Line trains  Cumberland station  You can purchase visitors passes at the Cumberland station  They are in a different machine than the regular trainbus tickets  For  you can get unlimited rides on the El CTA and PACE buses  Also you can get either a   or  day pass for   and  respectively  These passes are a great deal considering it is  round trip to Chicago  And if you ride the bus a couple times in a day your pass will more than pay for itself  You can also get these passes at OHare Union Station and a couple other places  The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport  Never had to wait longer than about  minutes  Overall the hotel staff was very nice and it is a lovely property  However it needs to be cleaner with respect to both rooms and public areas  For instance there was quotstuffquot on the rug outside the elevator on the th floor for over  hours  This should have been vacuumed up Breakfast on subsequent days was better although it took until the final day for the server to ask if I wanted toast I met the restaurant manager and spoke with him at length about my issues  He actually gave me a coupon for a complimentary appetizer in the bar since the Club Lounge was closed  I had steak quesadillas that were very good  The bar was empty save for one other couple  Service was friendly but less than attentive  Wound up leaving due to the foul language being used by both the woman and man sitting down the bar  I will skip the lecture about not using filthy language in public  Please show some class There was a billing error at checkout  I was charged for too many nights I had a coupon for a free night and I was charged for internet service for two days which was only used once  The person at the desk seemed a bit annoyed that she had to fix it for me  Perhaps it was just too early I would say that   of the staff was wonderful  There are just a couple people who need some extra training in customer service With a good rate I  consider returning but there are other hotels that I think are in better shape than this Renaissance  This is supposed to be a more upscale brand than a regular full service riott  In my opinion the rooms are a little too  cold  and stark  I guess this is the new trend but it makes this place seem too much like an  officequot and less like a hotel  Yes it is geared to business travelers but there is a fine line between office and a hotel room with space to work  To me this place is an office that happens to have a bed  It wasn t horrible just not the best  Again this is just my opinion  Different strokes for different folks  Most people love it I didn t  
P => Great room Cheerful people I just stayed at the Renaissance OHare last weekend and it was a great experience overall Everyone I spoke to at the hotel was courteous and friendly  There were some issues discussed below but none of them illicited any bad behavior from the hotel staff I flew in at am and they had a room waiting for me The suite was spacious with a huge shower  TVs and a great view from the th floor  I had the corner room that was close to the elevators and right across from the vending machines but that didnt bother me  In fact I loved the location I never heard much noise from the hallway or outside  The bed was comfy and I slept well The train station into the city is a very short walk away just across the parking lot which was perfect There is also a Starbucks in the lobby for that morning coffee fix I ordered room service for breakfast on my last morning and the food was quite good  Also the shuttle service to the airport was a great perk Here are my only complaints which is why I couldnt give it a perfect rating When I arrived at the shuttle pickup area I called the hotel and was told Id just missed the am shuttle but one would be arriving in  mins  Their shuttle is supposed to pick up every  mins  starting at am  Well  mins  passed and there was no shuttle  I also found out another person who was standing at the same door had also been waiting for the shuttle   since before am  I called the hotel again and was told the shuttle had come by twice already but wed never seen it  Finally at  the shuttle arrived  So dont count on this service to be on time  I left my hotel room at am and was gone until pm  Of course I expected maid service to come by in my absence  When I got back I found the room exactly as Id left it When I complained about this to the front desk on my way out the receptionist told me that I have to call and request maid service because sometimes they dont clean the rooms Ive been in much cheaper hotels that had maid service every day  
P => What a great hotel My mother son and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway  What a really wonderful hotel Our suite was very nice and I loved the bathroom  There is no tub however which was a disappointment for my mother  The shower is huge though and theres plenty of space in the bathroom  The bed was quite comfortable and had  pillows on it  There was a television in both rooms which was handy  We booked the breakfast package which I highly recommend  The buffet breakfast in the restaurant quotFreshquot was delicious  Along with fruit breads meats and cereal there was a made to order breakfast station where a chef would make you an omelet pancake waffle eggs whatever  Along with the breakfast you get a free strawberry banana smoothie in a shot glass which was a fun idea  The stay for breakfast package was only an additional  so for the  of us was a great deal  The hotel also has a great pool area including a hot tub and sauna in each locker room  The pool itself is huge  On Friday nights they have swim up movies where they show a movie on one wall of the pool area to watch while swimming  My son loved it and it really kept him occupiedBy far my favorite thing about this hotel though was the staff  I have never seen a hotel staff so seriously oriented toward customer service  Everyone we came in contact with was so helpful and cheerful The front desk people were great and the restaurant workers were amazing with my son  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat  Its a great deal and not too far from downtown Chicago  Its near a subway station so no need to worry about driving No airport noise in fact no noise of any kind in our room  Great experience 
P => Great hotel I was stuck in Chicago overnight when my flight got canceled out from Ohare due to the weather  I got a voucher for a discounted hotel and I only paid  for a night stay at this hotel  The hotel was very clean and spacious  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept on  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  The only problem I encountered when here was that I had to wait a good amount of time for the shuttle to the airport to come  I probably waited  minutes or so  Luckily I had planned enough time so I did not miss my flight  I would definitely stay here again  The hotel was also very close to the blue line station to catch the subway into down town  
P => Very comfortable stay We booked our stay at the Renaissance Hotel Chicago OHare through the website www parksleepfly com because we were going to Austin and coming back in the evening  I thought that we got a good rate of  plus tax for  nights parking which could have been  nights for the same rateand a lovely room  The room was quiet which I requested the beds and pillows very comfortable the room was extremely nicely appointed with a sitting area aside from the bedroom  The check in staff was friendly and competent  The shuttle was reliable but our timing might have worked with the  minute departures and pickups  They had the nicest toiletries I have seen  I have stayed at some very expensive hotels and I would put these accomodations up there with some of the best  The worst thing was just finding the shuttle pick up point at OHare which is supposed to be easy to find by the red foot prints  What red footprints And it was a good walk from our baggage pick up  
P => Excelletn hotel Great Service Very Clean I really enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance  I am the pickiest person I know of when it comes to hotels and I had no complaint with the room or service  The staff was friendly and helpful  I asked for a corner room and got a  room suite with a door on the bedroom  The room was very clean and had a nice large bathroom  I booked this hotel for  weekend rate on the riott website  I visited the business center to print my boarding pass  The business center charges to use the computers except they do have one computer for free that you can use to access only airline websites to print your boarding pass  I found the shuttle to be slow and waited  minutes to be picked up at Ohare  After seeing the shuttles for nearly every other hotel near the airport I callied the hotel for the nd time and was told that the shuttle leaves the hotel every  minutes and was on its way  If I were to go back I would take the train to the Cumberland stop go across the bridge so that you are on the right side of the road and then walk  minutes to the hotel  I found the room to be quiet even though I could see planes landing and lots of traffic on the highway down below  My room was on the th floor  Overall I thought this was a great hotel and it is obviously fairly new and well maintained  I didnt eat at the restaurants except for corffee in the morning from the Starbucks in the lobbby  
P => Good    not spectacular My family and I stayed here from       Here is a quick take on the pros and consPros  Spacious room and well appointed we had a bedroom with a erate sitting area   Large shower  Courteous staff  Starbucks in the lobby area  Nice bar area to have a drinkCons  NOISE from the trains on the El was awful    We were on the th floor facing the train station and could hear every train going by during the late night and early morning  Ask for a room where the noise is not as bad  my guess is lower is better too     Matresses were OK    nothing to write home about   Housekeeping did not replenish shampoo etc  each day  Minor but annoying    Three erate times we were denied exit at the parking garage automatic ticket scanner and had to go to the front desk to rectify the situation  After the third try I had them credit all parking fees day and parked in the lot across the street  I suggest doing the same as long as it is a weekend  During the week you must park in the garage or risk being towed   We did not eat in the restaurant  
P => Hot and cold Stayed a couple nights here while stranded from cancelled flights  Heres the hot and the coldThe Hot  Excellent value   paid only night with the airport coupons    Reliable shuttles   There were a bunch of us out there at  AM but the shuttle was there and we all got on   Room service   Fast and tasty some of the best room service food Ive ever had  Great veal ravioli   Roomy   These are all suites and it was nice to have the extra room   Huge bathroom   Shower was twice the size of a typical  shower  No tub   Comfortable bed   Important at any airport hotel   QUIET   Planes flew overhead but you hardly heard them    TVs   nice for those remote control disputes   Staff   Friendly and helpful   Mini Refrigerator The Cold  Actually it was the heat that was the problem  It was warmer than normal for Chicago in ember but the hallways had  to be  degrees plus  Rooms werent much better and  lowering the thermostat to Cold didnt help  Never was fixed  Had to open the windows to cool room down and let the noise in too   TV channels   Very few to choose from   Housekeeping   Came at PM and never replaced  anything in the bathroom except the towels  Had to call for more shampoo   Vending   Pepsi machine problems  Machine on our floor  wouldnt take bills  Tried the next floor and out came a Pepsi even hotter than the air temperature   Pitiful gift shop   Not really a gift shop at all and they dont call it one  Just a couple coolers next to the front desk with drinks and sandwiches  Also a few snacks and toiletries   Nothing close by   In an office park area with no restaurants nearby except a Bennigans but even that isnt very close   Starbucks closes early evening The good outweighs the bad here and it would have been much better without the heat situaton  It was certainly a good value and Id stay again if we got a similar deal  
P => Fun Time in the Windy City My family and I stayed here the week before Thanksgiving and it was wonderful  The room was nice and spacious  Very clean as well  The beds were actually very comfortable for hotel beds  Swimming pool and hot tub area was very well kept  We had a massage there the first night and it was great  Nice professional masseuses working  The main restaurant was very nice  The dinner menu was a little small not much to choose from  I can tell you that the lobster bisque was delicious  The breakfast buffet had a nice selection with gourmet style eggs bacon and sausage and a nice fruit spread  Price was a little high for the breakfast buffet at  per person  The Starbucks in the main lobby didnt open until  a m  which was kind of a bummer  I was ready for my coffee at  a m  Beautifully orated for Christmas with several trees and a gorgeous winter scene  I would definetly stay at this hotel again  
P => Good beds  showers  frigs roomsuite design varies weekend deals possible ember weekend rate was especially good for riott rewards member  plus tax  nd stay for us bed just as comfortable and large tiledglassed in shower well equipped still had good water pressure  Refrigerator a welcome feature  Possible to walk through hotel and adjacent business complex to the quotElquot that runs between OHare and Chicagos downtown Friday often quieter than Saturday there can be weekend wedding receptions with more partying people gathering  As for location despite nearby expressway and airport noise is not bothersome On our first stay the two part room living area and bedroom was divided by a wall and there were TVs in both areas  Made sleeping area more cozy and private  This stay our different room had no wall and only one TV that swiveled and could be viewed from either side    open area did not work as well as the wall and arate TVs In hotel Starbucks handy had good service in bar and restaurant  Restaurant pricey for dinner but offset by better than expected meal quality There is a covered parking garage great if Chicago weather turns bad but beware it too can be an expensive add on to your bill  
P => Excellent hotel near ORD I had an evening arrival to ORD followed by an early business meeting  miles north and picked Renaissance for the first time usually stay at ORD Hilton  Very happy with the hotel excellent stay  Check in staff was friendly and fast lobby and common areas were bright and very clean  Room was nicely appointed clean and spacious larger than airport Hilton rooms plus quiet despite being directly on the arrival flight path  Comfortable beds and very nice bathroom with large walk in shower as well  View cant compete with Hiltons runway views for airplane nuts but that doesnt really matter Didnt try their restaurants for dinner or breakfast but the Starbucks in the lobby is a plus for those O Dark Thirty checkouts No obvious negatives at all from business travelers perspective  Will stay here again  
P => Loved everything Stayed   for both business and pleasure  LOVED the location  The room was large and comfortable and it was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in  I really cant say enough about this hotel  We would definitely recommend it  
P => Would Stay Again Stayed at the Renaissance Chicago OHare for a work related reason on    The hotel is located close to OHare airport and has a complimentary shuttle xhour  My room was clean and quiet  As I arrived late in the evening we all went next doors to Beningenss for a late dinner which was excellent  There is a good variety of beers on tap The Renaissance Chicago OHare is right next to the Cumberland station on the Blue Line of the CTA Chicago Transit Authority so that it took only about  minutes or so to go to downtown Chicago the Loop  It only takes a few mintues to walk from the hotel to the Cumberland Statin  The fare is only one way  I would definitely recommend the Renaissance Chicago OHare for travelers coming to Chicago for business or other purposes  
P => Very nice hotel good service clean and spacious rooms I stayed at this hotel for a work conference held in Chicago  A major plus is that they offer FREE shuttle service tofrom the airport which is very close  The hotel or was very nice and the rooms were very clean nice and spacious  There is an quotLquot stop for the blue line that will take you downtown or to the airport  Some friends visited me at the hotel and we ate at the restaurant downstairs  The food and service were pretty good  I ordered room service a couple of times  The only complaint I have about this place was that no one picked up my breakfast order the night before so I didnt receive breakfast the next morning as I was expecting  I was not compensated for that mishap  They did apologize  I did forget my toothbrushtoothpaste and the front desk staff kindly gave me a couple  The hotel will call cab service for you  Just be sure that you ask ahead of time approximately what the charge will be and if it will be metered  I had a problem with one of the drivers from the company they called getting upset that the previous woman had charged much less and he had no meter and wanted to charge  more  Overall I had a nice quiet stay  
P => No complaints except the breakfast An excellent hotel to which I would gladly return  I found the bed to be especially comfortable and contrary to the experience of some other reviewers my room was very quiet  be it depends on location  I was on an upper floor well away from the highway and facing away from the airport  My room overlooked a huge parking lot for commuters and office workers but I couldnt hear any noise from that despite my staying there a Thursday night  My only complaint was the breakast   the food and service were very mediocre  
P => Great Pool Weekend My wife and I stayed here for two nights y  with our   year old for a swim weekend  Overall we had a really great time with a few minor hiccups  The front desk staff is a bit hit or miss  We had some really friendly knowledgeable GSAs and a couple who need a little career counseling  Our suite was immaculate as was the rest of the hotel  The hallways grounds and public spaces were all clean and very well cared for  The bell staff and housekeepers were all friendly and professional  The pool was clean and the upbeat music was a nice touch  Towel availability for the pool was hit or miss but theres a phone right there to call with when they run out  The room was large enough but is not a true two room suite  The two quotroomsquot are actually one room with a low dresser as a divider  The single television would have been as issue had we spent more time in the room and was sort of an issue in trying to watch TV while getting Mr  quotIm too excitedquot to sleep There was no refrigerator but the ice machine was near the elevator lobby  Little things like the bathroom light switch being installed upside down and the bedroom blinds that were broken are simple fixes that housekeepers couldshould report  None of those things will keep us from going back  The pool was great the fitness center was nice and open  hours and the hot tub was hot  Overall a really good deal at an above average OHare area hotel  
P => Wonderful Hotel with First Class Service My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one evening prior to our departure from OHare to Jamaica  We also stayed one night upon our return home  The hotel is lovely  The suites are spacious clean with modern amenities including a fully glassed in tile shower  The Chicago skyline was clearly viewed from both of our rooms  The entire hotel is comprised of modern art o or  quotFreshquot the on site restaurant was also quite good  We appreciated the on site Starbucks as well The best feature of this hotel is the covered secured parking garage  I researched park and fly rates prior to calling the   reservation line  I found an on line rate of  with free parking up to  days  When I called the reservation   I was quoted  The reservation center promptly honored the internet rate  Be sure to do your homework first and ask for the lowest rate youve found  The night of our return was   also very ent for this great hotel  Finally the morning that we left we were struggling to handle our luggage and two cups of coffee  A very polite man approached us and assisted us to our car  He was sincerely friendly and interested in feedback on our stay  He later introduced himself as the general manager of the hotel  We were very impressed and appreciative of his kindness and assistance We highly recommend this hotel especially the park and fly option  
P => Renaissance improving    excellent food overall acceptable Hotel stay Friday e rd thru Sunday e th I visited this hotel in il  for the Chicago Hair Show  Overall the experience was somewhat improved better food and alcohol  I am writing this review in hopes of improved overall experience on our next visit  Positive changes Food from the Mediterranean Caf  restaurant was exceptional the regular coffee was smooth and tasty the breakfast buffet complimentary with  club floor  suite was excellent the chefs prepared  on the fly  omelets that were fresh and delicious  The bacon was of the highest quality and danish was tasty and not too sweet  A mushroom burger ordered via room service was well prepared delivered promptly and very tasty   th floor suite was clean bed was very comfortable environmental controls worked well  Hotel elevators are plentiful  and move quickly between floors  Hotel staff was polite and accommodating perhaps the concierge was a bit naive regarding travel in the area   Wireless broadband access in the lobby was a welcome perk Criticsms Ice maker on th floor never had ice probably broken Vertical tile directly across from the shower door unattached to wall   the grout was broken  Minor communication errors for example    double beds requested but one king delivered room service hamburger missing bacon luxury car delivered from front desk instead of a standard  low end  cab staff explained that breakfast and other free services were available in the  club room  but the room was never opened  In room safe couldn t be opened Saturday night due to busy front desk and presumably staff unavailability the problem wasn t resolved for an hour  After previewing a pay per view movie and accidentally hit  buy  I was unable to  cancel  the transaction because there was no cancel button on the remote  Prefer vertical wall arating suite living room area from bedroom  Grateful that the parking garage credit card reader not working no additional charges for parking Recommend some kind of   parking pass for guests and  for others  
P => Comfortable place My husband a friend and myself stayed at this place about a month ago during a long layover from the airport  Shuttle was efficient and direct to front door  We had made reservations through Priceline so we got a reasonable price about  for a suite  The rooms are beautiful and our friend Kate even said that the pull out bed in the couch was just fine  The bathrooms are immaculate and so posh The usual shampoo and conditioner were replaced by quotnaturalquot type amenities that were fantastic  If we hadnt been so tired and on our way to being sick it would have been really nice to enjoy all the hotel had to offer  We did not hear traffic at all while we were there by the way  Very quiet and two televisons    one in the bedroom and another in the work arealiving room  Would certainly stay here again if I could get the same price  I took photos but theyre about the same as all the others on here Beautiful 
P => Loved the Place Stayed at the Renaissance Chicago OHare in   and I cant say enough great things about the place  Rooms Very large well appointed rooms including a great work area  The TV swivels so you can view the TV from either the bed or workcouch area  Beds are very comfortable with lots of pillows and nice linens  Very very quiet  I am not sure how they pull it off but we did not hear a sound from either rooms next door or busy expressway nearby  Bathroom is large with granite countertops and glass walk in shower  Everything was extrmely clean and well maintained  It felt new Location About two miles from Ohare  Shuttle runs every  minutes from the airport bus terminal  About one block walk to the Cumberland EL station  We took the train downtown each day takes about  minutes Very inexpensive and fun  I enjoyed zipping along the tracks while traffic in both directions was sitting still on the quotexpresswayquotstaff Extremely nice and helpful  Even offered to take us over to our favorite hot dog stand a few miles away Jean and Judes Work out facility They have a fully equipped large work out room that rivals any health club  Stairmasters treadmills free weights and machines  Fairly large Indoor pool and arate dry sauna for men and women  All well maintained and not crowded Given that we only paid about  including taxes I was not expecting such a plush experience  Highly recommended  I only wish we could have spent more time at the hotel  
P => Great Rooms Value Service Needs to Improve This was my third stay at the OHare Renaissance  I stayed four nights this time  This is an all suite hotel and the rooms are just beautiful  The bathrooms have glass shower stall and ble vanity  There is a large working desk and small living area  There is a laptop safe and a TV in the living area and the bedroom  The rooms are very quiet even with the Kennedy Expressway outside and jets flying overhead all day and night  I did not have any trouble with noise  The Concierge Lounge is nice too  This hotel is only steps away from the Cumberland stop on the Blue Line quotElquot so if you want to save money you can stay here and take the train into downtown for sightseeing meals etc  The staff at this hotel have not learned what excellent service is  I didnt have any problems but many employees I spoke to just didnt seem very interested looked at you with blank faces and used language one would use with friends rather than a customer at a nice hotel  They need training  This would not deter me from staying here however as overall its a great value  I would expect only adequate but not great service  
P => opinion of solo woman traveller I was on a United flight that was cancelled in ember of  so United gave me a number to call and I got a room for around   Well I have stayed at many hotels around the world and I couldnt have asked for more from an airport hotel  The hotel itself is clean and nicely orated  The elevators were quite large and adequitly fast   The staff I dealt with were pleasant and professional  The room was spacious although I was alone it looked like it could have easily accomoodated a couple or small family  The room was very clean which is good as Im a bit of a neat freak and tend to notice these things when it comes to hotels  Nicely scneted bath products and my favourite kind of shower stall with flexible shower head  Great bed very comfortable and I slept like a queen with my seven pillows Room service  As it was late when I arrived and I was tired from travelling I instead of going to the onsite restaurant ordered rooms service  A club house sandwich that cost around  and came with fries and condiments  The food arrived quickly and was pretty darn good for a clubhouse I only have two trivial complaints but these are the kinds of things I have noticed at many hotels in the US and Canada so this hotel is not an exception  First one bedside lamp did not work but I didnt need it anyway and secondly the sitting area curtains didnt work properly and not due to any ignorance of how to work them on my part Overall if you are a woman travelling alone as I was I think you will like it here as would anyone who needs a place to stay when their flight is cancelled  
P => great suites beautiful modern european looking hotel  The suites are large enough for a family erate bedroom and living room large TV in each room  Each room has privacy  Location is close to OHare airport and shuttles run every  minutes  I got the room on priceline for half of what it was listed on the website  Highly recommend this hotel  
P => spacious and super comfortable We needed a hotel close to the airport and after reading wonderful reviews on this one we ided to stay at the Renaissance  The front desk service was friendly and efficient  Our room was SOOOO great We have a baby and needed a little extra room so our suite was perfect It actually had a erate bedroom  The bed was SOOO comforable with soft sheets and lots of pillows  You could access the bathroom through the bedroom and the living room area  The bathroom was HUGE The shower was so luxurious  Its so big we felt like we were royalty There was plenty of room for my husband and I both to get ready in there  The living room was great  It had a couch and a couple of chairs with a coffee stationfridge and another TV There was a HUGE desk in there as well that would nicely accomodate business travelers We ordered the room service  I guess it was pretty typical  The food was served fast but tasted awful and was extremely pricey  It was late and we were starving so it did the job I will stay there again in a heartbeat 
P => Clean Rooms Good Bar I travel every week to many different locations  The rooms at this hotel were quite possibly the cleanest Ive ever been in  Very modern and comfortable  Good for relaxing or getting some work done  Nice shower  The bar was inviting and so were the ladies  Good times  
P => Revive at Renaissance It is grand from the moment you step off the shuttle bus  Though located so close to the airport theyve spared no expenses on this recently built riott hotel I could see the downtown skyline from my th floor window  The room was very tastefully done and spacious  The staff was attentive except for a little mixup with room service the morning of my departure  There is a blue line station right next to the hotel less than a  minutes walk this will connect you to all the quotElquot lines in the city and it took about  minutes to make it to town Enjoy your stay 
P => Clean Convenient Hotel Overall liked the Renaissance quite a bit  no reason not to stay there again but also be no reason to go running back The positives very new hotel the CLEANEST room Ive stayed in in a very long time friendly helpful front desk nice concierge lounge with good breakfast comfortable bed and bedding easy shuttle to the airportThe negatives the room I was in wasnt exactly a suite  it was more of an L shaped studio with a swiving tv on a low piece of furniture to divide the room so you didnt really feel like you had a true division of space and while its a nice place it wasnt at all cushy or plush or high quality as my impression of Renaissance hotels normally is  I believe Renaissance is a fairly high end chain in the rriott hotel and I definitely didnt feel the furnishings fit that description as compared to say the Renaissance downtown Chicago  I also dont agree with previous comments about price  I paid  for my room which was a AAA discount over the regular rate over   Not a good value for this hotel Again the place is very nice new and CLEAN which all count for a lot  Its also just not anything all that out of the ordinary  
P => Great Hotel perfect location Just got back from a four day visit to Chicago and loved the hotel we stayed at  The customer service was excellent the beds were comfortable with many pillows the rooms were nicely furnished modern and they had a great deskwork area and roll out sofa  The staff was friendly the ElSubway was within walking distance as well as restaurants like Bennigans for a late drinkburger  In addition the shuttle from the airport was easy and quick  Only negatives  Parking was  per night and you could hear some trafficplanes in peak periods but overall a great experience and we would stay there again on our next visit  
P => Great Property Close to the Airport Stayed at the Renaissance OHare during a business trip for one night  The hotel was great  Each room is a mini suite with more than enough room to get work done and also to relax  The hotels location right off of the highway and minutes to OHare makes it ideal for doing business in the nearby area and also for catching the early morning flights out of OHare  
P => This Renaissance is the One  
P => excellent staff clean large rooms  
P => Great stay at the Renaissance OHare

P => Great Hotel off Mag Mile Pros   nice block of hotels and buildings kitchenette and buffett breakfast clean and modern hotel cant get closer to mag mile without being on itCons   grocery store is more than a few blocks away if location is your prority this is not place   try river north about  blocks to closest el station   not ok in the winterI like staying at Residence Inns when Im on vacation for longer than week  No need to eat out every meal because of the kitchnettes plus there is a pretty good buffet breakfast and free newspapers in the morning  This Residence Inn is located on Walton a block from the lake and a block from the top of Michigan Ave  For your frist trip to Chicago this is really a great location to stay in but river north is really better to stay at  This close to bloomingdales macys and the designer shops you can catch the tour bus and go to the chocolate factory  State street navy pier the musuems are walk but possible  
P => Magnificent MileHotel Our stay at the riott Residence Inn was relaxing  The hotel is one block just off Michigan Ave the Magnificient Mile  Great location for dinning and shopping  Its just a  minute walk to the Navy Pier  Our room a one bedroom suite which included a full kitchen was spacious comfortable and clean  The amenities were updated and nice The hotel offered a breakfast buffet every morning with a different menu each time  On Wednesday and Thursday of our stay they offered a dinner buffet freeWe highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again on our next trip  
P => Great Location awesome rooms Got a real good deal on internet site one of the nicest hotels Ive been at for its price and location  It within walking distance of a lot of attractions and the room featured a kitchen and really nice TV  
P => Clean Great Service Friendly Staff I stayed at this hotel for one week in ust  It was fabulous  Clean comfortable great kitchen with stove refrigerator microwave and even a dishwasher a fabulous option to eating out Delicious hot breakfast buffet Free dinner about three times that week  The kitchen amp buffet staff were very friendly and there was even a very nice lady with a delightful voice who graced us with her singing I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again  Great location in downtown Chicago  Walking distance to many stores restaurants and beautiful Lake Michigan  Great experience  
P => Nice place Our HR Technology conference hotel was sold out so we booked this and it was surprisingly very nice  Only compliant would be be the elevators were slow  Room was nice and clean  Rate was reasonable  Free dinner and drinks in the evening and free breakfast pretty good  
P => Excellent location    terrible front desk staff The location is great    next to the Hancock and Water Tower and all of the shopping goodness that the Mag Mile has to offer  The front desk staff is terrible  For the amount of money that the room costs and the amount the valet parking costs you would think they would be better at being more friendly and helpful  Although the front desk staff service is appalling the breakfastevening meal ladies are great They go out of your way to make you feel at home  
P => Overall great hotel but the rooms could benefit from some changes The hotel was located a few blocks off Michigan Avenue quotMagnificent Milequot so the location was great  We had five people sharing a suite  bedrooms and a sofa bed and there was only one bathroom  The bathroom has a toilet and shower by itself and the sink is outside the door in a quotcommon area quot The bathroom did not have a vent fan and the sink being outside was inconvenient for those quotmiddle of the night bathroom tripsquot since we had a person sleeping on the sofa bed that was disturbed when you washed your hands  Also there are no mirrors in the bedrooms which means when you have five people getting ready in the morning they are in close quarters near the bathroom And youll probably wait awhile for the elevator and dont plan on taking the stairs to the lobby because they dump you outside of the hotel  
P => Good value   shame about some of the guests I had five nights here on business in Chicago  The room was very comfortable even if some details were looking a little tired and it was an excellent location just off Michigan Avenue although the immediate neighborhood is significantly more upscale than the hotel itself and short of medium price eating  The internet connections worked fine and the room was well serviced with consistently friendly staff throughout the hotel and a real effort to make guests welcome  The daily complimentary breakfasts and mid week happy hours added to the good value but there was a real lack of lobby seating to consume them  At weekends the obvious value for families meant that free breakfast rapidly descended into total chaos with ample and gross evidence of how American kids come to be so obese  Navigating the buffet where the staff struggled to keep up with the customers rate of consumption required constant vigilance to avoid stepping on small children with groaning plates  I was quite glad to be able to shut this out when I closed the suite door   and it is fair to say that internal noise was never a problem despite the large number of families present  Mid week was a little more civilized  
P => Perfect in every way One word describes the stay at this hotel  PERFECT  The staff location room couldnt have been better  We will return to this hotel and have recommended it to many  
P => Great location great hotel Five girls from OhioMichigan went for a girl s weekend in Chicago  Our travel plans had us arriving at am of course check in wasnt until pm but when I called that morning to see if we could check in early they accommodated us  The location could not be better   just shy of the Gold Coast and right next to Water Tower Shops and the John Hancock bldg  The street was quite considering we were downtown Chicago  The Drake and Millennium Hotels are down the street  Every morning we walked several miles in the morning   very safe neighborhood  We were two blocks east of Michigan Ave and able to walk to Rush Street  Oak Street Beach is less than  mile  The bus stops were close and allowed us to travel pretty freely thru the city  The hotel appeared to be recently reated and has very lovely lobby  A full breakfast buffet is served every morning eggs sausage pastries fruits waffles etc  The staff both at the valet and the front desk was friendly  In fact every staff member but one went out of their way to say hello good morning how is everything  Our two bedroom suite had a slice of a lake view a full sized oven and refrigerator dishwasher and kitchen wares  The living area Master bedroom and second bedroom had flat screen TVs  The toiletshower is arate from the sink which made it convenient for five women to get ready  There was also a arate lighted mirror with outlets  Free wireless We were fortunate enough to have a riott Friends and Family discount   total for three nights     we did utilize the valet parking for one night but then moved the vehicle to my nephew s residence to avoid the day fee  
P => Perfect location great staff  Very high cost and overcrowded elevator Great Miracle Mile location  Quiet side street right off the best part of Michigan Ave  close to shopping and night spots Staff goes over and beyond  Nice complementary breakfast  Free Internet but wireless was down the whole week I was there   only wired worked Downside is a very costly high end rate for a mid tier hotel Suites are large but limited with only  bathroom The other drawback is the  small slow elevators are insufficient for the hotels size  There can be a long wait and theyre very crowded at peak times Another issue which  be a plus for some is that they appear to accepts guests with large dogs  There are signs posted that pets cannot use the main elevator which seem to be ignored  
P => Good Location  Good Value with a Little Research  The price for this hotel on the riott web site is    I got it for   on Priceline and was able to add air fare on American for less than what I would have paid on all the major travel web sites for air and hotel combined  That said I enjoyed my short time at the Residence Inn e    Theres not a whole lot I can add that hasnt already been addressed in previous reviews but I will try The Thursday night I was there they had a Chicken Ceasar Salad and Soup night for the quotManagers Reception quot It appears they do something different each Thursday night of the month  I had already eaten but I tried the salad and it was not too bad  I did not try the soup  They had Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite on tap  However one tap ran out the Miller Lite and the other one was spewing foam  One of the hotel staff members worked on it and finally started pouring beer from the tap into pitchers and taking them around and filling up peoples cups  After a while she just filled the pitchers and left them by the tap  It took me a while to find the wine  Turns out the wine red is in a dispenser much like what one might use to dispense orange juice so it was a little confusing They have other themes during the week like Bar be que on Wednesday night hot dogs on Tuesday I believe  etc  As for breakfast one morning they had scrambled eggs and patty sausage and the next day it was scrambled eggs and link sausage  There were a couple of waffle machines and they had fruit cereal bread on so on The room was nice  I liked the big shower versus the usual bath tub with shower  The only complaint I would have is my room faced Walton and I could hear alot of the street noise and rowdy folks out front but no big deal  I found it weird that the in room literature said there was no need to get ice as I could get it from the ice maker in the fridge  I then opened the fridge to find two empty ice trays  While I was there the TV channels went digital and CBS and HBO disappeared  Not sure why that happened Someone mentioned a store quotbehindquot the hotel  It is actually on a side street  You have to go down some stairs to get there  The night I went there were some questionable characters at the top of the stairs asking me if I wanted my shoes shined  I was wearing tennis shoes so I passed on the shoe shining and ided to pass on going down the stairs to the store  I turned around and walked the few steps back to the hotel I was in town for the NeoCon show at the Merchandise t  I took a cab a few times and the cost was        For some reason the cabs leaving the hotel added   to the trip that wasnt added on the way back  I did discover I could catch the  Water Tower Express from in front of the Hancock Building and it was only    It would drop me off in front of the Merchandise t on Wells and pick me up in front on Ontario  I was also able to bus it over to the Cadillac Theater to see a Broadway play y Poppins   fun show even for a  year old guy  I took a cab back to the hotel and it was still only       As other folks have noted Michigan Ave  is only two blocks away and you can go a block or two the other direction and be at the water  You can see the fireworks from there that they shoot off from the Navy Pier every Wednesday and Saturday night Eats wise I hit Gene and Georgettis Steak House  Itailian wait staff white table cloths  Steaks are high dollar and my strip steak was incredibly thick  Dont think I would go back there though      with tip for one  Hit the Billy Goat Tavern for a quotCheesborger quot Its OK but nothing outstanding  Ginos East is good for pizza  Tried some Chicago Dogs  They were OK too but wasnt impressed  be I went to the wrong place  I think it was called Americas Favorite Dog or something like that Hope some of this helps with your trip to Chicago  I dont think I would pay   for the Residence Inn with all the deals out there but if you can get it for   go for it  
P => good hotel clean and good hotel for ourfamily 
P => You dont need a rental car here Great Location This is your typical Residence Inn which is good if you need a refrigerator and a place to eat in the room  The studio king was good for  people but I wouldnt recommend it for  or  people because you would be tight on personal space and closet space Good central location where you can catch the bus to basically anywhere in the city i e    Lincoln Park Zoo   Navy Pier   Museum Campus   Museum of Science and Industry  If you prefer cabs youll never have a problem since there are so many right outside the door There wasnt a problem with noise from outside or with the neighbors  Free breakfast wasnt a problem it was never crowded even at the peak times  Although there were only  elevators it was never an issue  But we visited in late  so I dont know how it is during the summer The room was clean and the bed was comfortable  I dont think the sofabed would be comfortable at all and the blanket for the sofabed is very thin  The free internet was a plus although it was not wireless you have to plug in Overall it was a pleasant stay and I like it because every time we went to the bus stops close to the hotel and boarded the bus it wasnt crowded but as the bus went down Michigan Ave  Mag Mile it would fill up FYI  You can see the fireworks from the Navy Pier if you walk all the way down Walton to Lake shore Drive Wed   and Sat   
P => this hotel was perfect just hosted a wedding in chicago memorial day weekend so needed a comfortable place for all the out of town guests  this hotel was perfect for people coming for   days  most stayed in the  bedroom suite this has an oversize bedroom and a arate large living room  we got very inexpensive AAA rates good breakfast included  lobby is a great quothang outquot area  hotel feels like one is staying in a condo in a posh part of town  what with a busy wedding weekend we didnt need a pool  dont stay here if you need one  staff was excellent  
P => Surprising deal right downtown Such a surprise for a really nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area  Good deal and very friendly staff Greeted you everytime you walked around somewhere  
P => Reations fell short in key areas This is a well located hotel with attractive updated rooms  I stayed in a studio with a modern kitchen flat panel TV and a clean comfortable bathroom shower only  As usual at this level riott internet service is free  When I first walked in I was amazed by what I got for the money  Add in the excellent location friendly service and lake views and it seemed hard to beat What I found the first night though greatly changed my impression  The bed was lumpy with a depression on the side closest to the bathroom  I suppose thats where most guests have slept over the years  Too bad the bed was forgotten when the other reations were carried out  Worse yet the quiet room I requested turned out to be anything but  The elevator is old and noisy  Even though I was across the hall and two doors down I could hear the elevator whirring up and down all evening long and again the next morning  It was nearly impossible to sleep except in the few quiet hours after midnight  Im a huge fan of riott so it is takes a lot to write anything negative  But until they replace the old elevators and beds this property doesnt live up to its potential  If you do choose to stay here and you are a light sleeper you should request a room at the FAR end of the hallway  
P => Excellent Value in Downtown Chicago My  dhters and I stayed at this hotel for two nights and had a great experience  The location cant be beat we walked almost everywhere and never felt unsafe at all  The room was very clean and the kitchenette was really lovely  The bathroom was clean and updated with a arate sinkvanity area which helped when  women were trying to get showered and dressed The breakfast was excellent with lots of choices and plenty of room to sit  One of my dhters is a fitness freak and she had no complaints about the fitness center  This is not a luxury hotel obviously but everything was clean updated and more than adequate  The staff was friendly and helpful  The only things that I would consider quotconsquot were the elevators are very small and noisy and when we had the sleeper sofa out it was very crowded in the room  Other than those  things it was a very pleasant and affordable stay  
P => Would stay again without a doubt I stayed at this hotel for one night on business  The front desk staff were so helpful and accomodating  They gave me a free upgrade  I was so surprised to go to the room and find a kitchen with full fridge sink granite counter microwave and free microwave popcorn  There was a normal size coffee pot with a few packets for morning coffee  There was a nice sized living room with a flat screen tv then another in the bedroom which had a king size comfie bed  The price was less than another hotel I visited in Chicago  The other hotel was cold dreary the floors were uneven it was outdated etc  I was wondering what this would be like since I paid less here than the other one  Great place clean friendly  We walked to the Cheesecake factory about a block away  They had a free barbeque like they always do on Wed  night but we did not choose to stay for it  Breakfast included eggs sausage potatos oatmeal fruit several choices of dry cereal breads waffles on and on  I have nothing negative to say I would stay here again 
P => Sleeples in Chicago When I checked into this hotel I told the concierge that I was a light sleeper and requested a room away from lift machinery and fire doors that  bang shut  My room seemed acceptable with a view out from the side of the hotel However EVEN WITH EARPLUGS IN I was woken the first morning by a refuse cart in the street at the back of the hotel BEFORE am Jeez   cant really blame the hotel for that just the ludicrously early time they start to collect refuse in Chicago and the noisy way they go about it The next night some drunken idiots arrived back in the neighbouring room at around am lhing and shouting LOUDLY again waking me up  This went on for around  minutes at which point I phoned reception and asked them to do something They did NOTHING but eventually after a bit of banging on the wall from myself it went quiet next door   the neighbours must have passed out  I managed to get back to sleep at around am and woke at my normal time of  The disturbance of my sleep didnt help me on the  day course I was attending at the Siebel Institute When checking out I complained loudly about the lack of action concerning my noisy neighbours and was presented with   a package containing a quotSorryquot card a bottle of water and a packet of cookiesBIG DEAL I should have told them to STUFF IT WHERE THE SUN DONquotT SHINE My advice to anyone that  need some guaranteed uninterrupted sleep whilst staying in Chicago because they are on a course or a business meeting pay a little more and go up ket instead of staying at this noisy hotel as theres less likelihood of drunken scum being able to afford the ante   PLUS a ent hotel will do something if a guest is being noisy and disturbing other guests I give it  out of     ginally above a sleeze hole in India which gets a  
P => Great accomodations in downtown Chicago We visited Chicago for spring break in ch   We arrived at the hotel early and although our room was not ready we we called on our cell phone when the room was finished  Upon entering our room we were very pleased  We stayed in a studio room but since there were only two of us there was plenty of space especially for a downtown hotel  The bed was extremely comfortable and everything we could have possibly needed was there for us  The staff did tell us that the entire hotel was newly reated in ust of The staff was really friendly and helpful  We ordered dinner on a couple of nights and the front desk was great at recommending delivery restaurants  Our housekeeper even left us a little welcome treat and did a wonderful job at making sure our room was spotless The free breakfast was full of many options  We never found the room too crowded and the food was always hot and fresh  It was amazing how nice this breakfast was with the low price we payed for the room  Definately a bargain We used public transportation the entire time we were in Chicago  The hotel was only two short blocks from the bus we connected to on our way from OHare  The stop for the downtown busses was close as well  We did the  day pass and defnintely got our use out of it  EVERYONE on the busses drivers and passengers were very helpful and cheefulOne suggestion   the John Hancock building is a block away   instead of paying the observation k fees go to the lounge on the  floor two floors about the observation k and have a drink  You will only pay a couple more dollars to get a drink and there is no entry fee  We sat and watched the sunset in a wonderful setting If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay in this hotel 
P => Awesome service and location We stayed one night at a great rate of  through travelzoo  The staff could not have been more nice and helpful  While we were checking in and out they were getting compliments from other guests The room was very clean and the kitchen really helps when traveling with children  The full size refrigerator was a big plusThe location cannot be beat right off Michigan Ave  close to everything We would definitely stay here again  
P => Felt Like Home Residence Inn exceeded our expectations  We felt so comfortable safe and at home there  Our room was large and comfortable filled with many amenities that made it feel like home   sink refrigerator microwave dishes popcorn couch large TV etc  Everything was kept very clean  Breakfast was crowded but offered many options so we didnt have to eat the same thing everyday  Staff was moderately friendly  My only complaints were there werent enough blankets on the bed   could use a thicker comforter  Also its a little far from the subway station   especially in the middle of ruary   so plan on a lot of walking if youre using public transportation  Other than that we had a great experience here 
P => Great Night on the town My husband booked a room here for my birthday  He had called the hotel to ask for a nice room  The hotel only has  floors so it does not have major views but it is so close to everything    blocks to Michigan AveWhen we arrived the room was on the top floor with a partial water view  The staff had written me a birthday card with a free bottle of wine Nice touch The room had been recently remodeled and was really nice and modern and spotlessThe next morning we were a little late for breakfast buffet but the staff went into the kitchen and got us everything   they were so sweetWe are planning on bringing the kids back downtown this Xmas and would definately plan to stay here  Only one negative   the parking is really expensive but all downtown hotels are the same  We parked around the corner for  while the hotel is  overnight with no inout priviledges  
P => amazing value one of the best hotels we have EVER stayed at where to begin   got an amazing deal on priceline   hotel had everything we could ask for   rooms were huge for being downtown   king size bed LCD tv large bathroom couch full kitchen fridge stove microwave dishes utensils etc free breakfast and for the night we stayed there was free meatball subs and beer for dinner   i think they had the free beer because there was not a bar at the hotel   but there are tons of bars in the area   most importantly the room was clean and the location was great   a  minute walk from magnificent mile   only problem was parking but thats a problem EVERYWHERE in chicago   would highly recommend 
P => Great room with a sort of view The rooms are big and spacious       a nice thing in downtown Chicago  The hotel is just around the corner from the Hancock building  A nice breakfast is included       cereal waffles eggs buiscuts and gravy yogurt and more  If you get a room up high enough you can see Lake Michigan  From the lower floors you can see either the street or the building behind  All in all a great place to stay  Only real drawback is that there are only  elevators and  floors of rooms  So plan to wait for the elevator  
P => Girls Getaway Went beginning of   for a girls weekend  Had  people in a  bedroom suite  Only  bath wish there was more and was a tight squeeze  Full length mirror in awkward location  Hotel has a pretty good Buffet Breakfast  Location a couple of blocks from Hancock Building would have preferred something in the middle of Mag  Mile but cant find unless you want to pay for  rooms  For the price not bad  Delware Pantry around the corner  And if going to Chicago I would recommend a  or  day CTA pass for transpertation  
P => Good Value Stayed for  nights in early  this year  Very spacious  bedroom suite apart from the bathroom which is a little cramped  Great kitchen and large lounge room  Bed very comfortable stayed here with my wife  year old and mother in law very comfortably  Good location very friendly and helpful staff  Short stroll to Hancock lake and shopping  
P => Loved The Neighborhood Had a nice time there  Enjoyed walking around the neighborhood  Took in a show at the Drury Lane Theatre  blocks away  Shopped ate and grabbed some groceries all within easy walking distance Had a view of the frozen lake and some interesting buildings across the street    Bedroom Suite was larger than expected and well equipped  Except for the tiny toilet   One of my favorite rooms ever Liked the staff  The elevator was rather small and noisy  Would not recommend for people who didnt like elevators or confined spaces  Breakfast was average but the lobby it was served in was fantastic  It had lots of room and seating options  Would definitely stay there again if the price is right  
P => Home away from Home I was in Chicago for a  week period from early ember to mid ember   I stayed at the Residence Inn by riott in Downtown  Very good location and handy for shops restaurants and superkets  Hotel was only opened in il so felt very quotnewquot  The Residence Inn does a great social evening on Monday to Thursday and offers free wine beer and food for  minutes  Very good way to meet other residents in the hotel Very good breakfast as well although it does tend to get overrun with Children on a weekend The Thanksgiving meal was particularly good My only criticism was that I did get a quotsmallquot room and for a  week extended stay I would have expected a bigger one  I checked out some other rooms and they were much bigger  This has stopped me rating this as quotexcellentquot  I have to return to Chicago on a semi regular basis in  and will stay here again Michael 
P => Home from home Obviously part of the riott chain so that pretty much lets you know what to expect in advance  Two bed suite was huge  sq feet  In brief full kitchen  flat screen tvs absolutely massive living area with free wifi and hugh windows with beautiful views of lake Michigan  we were on th floor  and a free breakfast  Air Con and heating was perfect and it needed to be because of the snow and minus  temperatures Valet parking was  per day and in fairness was probably worth it and the guys did an excellent job with the cars Location was brilliant being just  yards off the North end of the Magnificient Mile  Water Tower End  and slap bang beside all the interesting tourist sites including Hancock Tower Navy Pier and the impressive Lincoln Park The girls on reception were always friendly and up for a chat All in all a very pleasant all suite hotel in a very pleasant city and hopefully well be back in the not too distant future  
P => Home Away from Home I stayed at the Residence in while attending a conference at an adjacent hotel  The staff was very welcoming and accomodated my request for a room on a lower floor  The rooms were extremely spacious more so than most Residence Inns  The room was sparkling clean and cleaned perfectly each day  There was a good selection at breakfast each day as well as at the dinner reception on one evening  
P => Good hotel This hotel has a great location about a block from Trump Tower and right across the street from the House of Blues  This hotel is brand new so it is very clean and the room is orated nicely and clean  There was no bathtub in our room which I missed but the shower was large  The only thing I have to complain about is that breakfast was a madhouse  Granted it was the weekend of Lollapalooza but it was ridiculous  There was not enough food and no organization  the breakfast area was too small  
P => Loved it This is a fantastic hotel The location is great its close to everything but off the Magnificent Mile so its quiet  The rooms are really nice sized  Having a mini kitchen is so convenient  The staff was wonderful  Free breakfast every morning It was a nice variety and there was something different every day  HIGHLY recommend this hotel  
P => Pleasant Surprise I knew this would be a great hotel from the moment I called directly to book our room which is   larger than typical hotel rooms  Walton Street is very quiet but just a  block from Michigan Ave  Oustanding Rosebud steakhouse is just across the street  We were pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to see how large the one bedroom suite really was  IMMACULATE kitchen with full size stainless appliances wood floor and a dining table  The living room boasted a large plasma tv stylish sleeper sofa a recliner another soft chair end tables and a coffee table which stowed a pull out ottoman  Even with a king size bed a large dresser another large plasma tv and two large night tables the bedroom was very spacious and included a large double wide closet  Considering it was myself and three teenage girls one drawback was the small size of the bathroom and the lack of counter space for the arate vanity area  The elevators ran slowly at high traffic times  I LOVED the complimentary  hour coffee bar in the lobby which included hot tea and cocoa also  The included hot breakfast was adequate and consisted of the usual along with cold cereals yogurt fresh fruit and juices  The staff was extremely pleasant and very helpful  Valet parking is  typical for any hotel in Chicago but these guys were very charming and polite  Even though we had to check out valet pulled our car around to load our luggage and then reparked it so we could eat and shop for the afternoon before leaving for home  If you want a clean large room with polite and gracious staff this is the place to go  If youre lucky you might run into Vince Vhn coming out of his apartment at the Palmolive which is just a few doors down 
P => Just an OK riott location The hotel is in a nice quiet location a block away from Michigan Avenue and has valet only parking  The rooms are very clean and modern with a nice flat panel television and modern appliances  Breakfast and dinner was below average compared to other Residence Inns that I have frequented  Elevators seemed to have technical difficulties frequently  Workout facility is poor at best  Treadmill bicycle recumbent bicycle and elyptical machines are filthy and users have to view the TV by looking at it in the mirrorTV set up behind equipment  
P => Great hotel especially with kids Stayed one night in two bedroom suite   three adults and one child  The room was immaculate   modern furniture  flat screen tvs spacious great kitchenette area stocked with everything you need   full size fridge microwave dishwasher coffee maker stove plates etc  We were very comfortable Easy walk to all of the shops on Michigan Avenue and good restaurants but ordered deep dish pizza and a salad from Giordanos which was great for the little one who was a bit cranky after a long day and would not have done well out in public  A number of other restaurants also deliver to the hotel Breakfast wasnt goumet but did the job  We loved staying here and would recommend it to anyone especially families  
P => Great location and very nice facility   Will come back I researched my hotel with TripAdvisor com and found this hotel and liked what I saw  We stayed at this hotel in   and found it exactly as described by other travelors  The hotel is very clean and well situated at the north end of the Manefiction Mile of the Chicago Downtown shopping district  You are only half block away from the busiest shopping district of North America  The hotel room is clean comfortable and spacious  We entertained a few friends of us from the local area and they were pleasantly surprised by how much room we have  With a  room suite we keep the guests in the living room area and have a great time The hotel offers evening beers drinks and appetizers for guests Mon Thur and they are great in quality and variety  A lot of business folks and family travelors all sit around enjoying the treats  Breakfast is okay but can be better Two things that are inadequate for family travelors are  expensive parking charge if you drive  per night and  there is no swimming pool with this hotel Overall very pleasant stay and we will go back if staying in Chicago downtown  
P => Great Location Excellent Staff Just got back from a quick trip to chicago to celebrate my sisters th birthday with friends  The riott Residence Inn was above our expectations  The room was appointed very nicely and extremely clean  The location of the hotel was perfect   would definitely recommend highly if you just want to walk to various trendy sections  Just a few blocks from Rush Street walked back from Old town Buck    great great great location  The staff was very accomodating but I will mention that the girls who work breakfast really stood out    they were so pleasant with a ready smile and always had nice thing to say to us  I wish I got names so management would know but I didnt  The one bedroom suite was very roomy the efficiency kitchen appointed well   we thought we would us it but never had the chance  Definitely go the the Drake Hotel bar for a fun time the bartenders at Knickerbockers next door were great James Hotel fun as well  
P => Middle of the pack Residence Inn has a great Location For riott this Residence Inn is probably middle of the pack in the terms of quality  However it is in Chicagos Magnificent Mile so that makes it a great place to stay  The  story hotel is next to the Hancock Building on Walton Place two blocks from Lake Michigan  It is two blocks from the Museum for Contemporary Art which on Tuesdays is free and hosts a farmer s ker on the front side on Tuesday AM and a jazz show on the back side on Tuesday PM  Parking is  a day  No one should bring a car to Chicago  The CTA  bus is three blocks away and will take you to the Chicago El Red Line    blocks away  World class shopping surrounds you  The Oak Street Beach is three blocks away  Good dinning is well is everywhere in Chicago  Our hotel room a one bedroom was good size about  square feet and in very nice condition  The kitchen was functional and new with stove full fridge small dishwasher microwave and two person table  The living area is sizeable about  square feet sleeper sofa recliner chair table and big screen TV  Bedroom was  square feet with great king size bed and wonderful pillows  Furniture is new  The views were nothing special  The drawbacks were the cookingmeal staff was undermanned  They cannot keep up with demand at breakfast or dinner  Food was OK but they were always running out and the place was a mess  The weekly dinner was an unimpressive sausage and tatter tots the most unappealing Ive ever had at a Residence Inn  The Managers Special for drinks should be skipped  The lobbydinning area was too small for the customer base  The patrons were swarming around waiting for people to leave their tables or joining yours  The customers were mostly families not business people so there were lots of screaming youngsters  The portersfront door staff was also undermanned  However the cleaning staff was good  Give the riott people credit all the staff were nice even the overworked and stressed people  It would be a much better hotel if they hired a few more people  
P => very nicely surprised I was not expecting much but what a nice surprise  The room was immaculate like a small suite  arate bedroom an incredibly comfortable bed with very fresh linen  Lots of soft pillows lots of towels nicely stocked kitchen with a dishwasher  Two flat screen TVs  A lovely breakfast buffet that is included with quite a bit more than your average continental breakfast  Really nice especially when you want to get sightseeing and can grab breakfast quickly  There is also food in the evening four times a week great for those with kids   coffee and tea in the lobby  The only thing I didnt like was a very slow elevator and I wish that there would have been a mirror in the bedroom  
P => Highly recommend this hotel  Great stay  Had a very spacious  bedroom suite with one king in one bedroom and one queen in a smaller nd bedroom  Very spacious although it would have made more sense to make the large living area smaller and the small bathroom only one bath a lot bigger  Very cramped bathroom  Very clean and comfortable with great beds water pressure and ac  Also thick walls   couldnt hear anything down the hall   tvs in the suite with about  channels  Great flat screen tvs Location was great    blocks to Oak St Beach  block to Hancock Bldg  blocks to Water Tower  Just couldnt beat the location  It is on a quiet street right off the mag  mile   mile walk to Navy pier  About  blocks to red line train that takes you to wrigley Had a very nice exercise room with  elipticals  treadmills  bikes and some weights  Very adequate Front desk was quite helpful and well staffed   there was never any long wait at the desk The only issue I had with hotel   the breakfast hours  They go from  am which is fine most of the year  In the summer they need to go til  or am so people can stagger their times they go down there  Just isnt much room between  am bc people know it is going to close at am  If they knew it was am they could come later thus reducing the congestion  That was an annoyance that could be avoided during summer tourist season  Breakfast itself was pretty good with some great steamed oatmeal  Just didnt like to stand while I ate bc of no tables  dollar cab fare from Midway to hotel  I loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again in the future  
P => Spacious and clean   but a few problems We love Chicago and wanted to spend a long weekend there with the kids twin toddlers  We booked a  bedroom suite  The hotel room corner suite room  was nice very spacious and very clean  Modern or which was a plus  Kids enjoyed it very much  Beds were comfortable and having a real functional kitchen with the room was more than what we expected  The complimentary breakfast buffet was okay not great  but pretty good for being free  Its very crowded after   You can easily walk to Water Tower Bloomingdales and Cheesecake Factory  Great location  Overall we really liked it and would have given it an excellent rating if it werent for these  pitfalls The toilet wobbled when sitting on it  And Im not talking about just the seat  The WHOLE toilet moved a bit whenever you sat on it  be the seal wasnt properly put it place or somethinghmmm   not sure  Not a good feeling when sitting on it though  Not sure if all the rooms had this problem  We asked for extra blankets  It took a while for someone to bring some be it was rush hour who knows  And when they did bring the blankets we were surprised to see that the spare blankets were so old and visibly worn out   that if you held them up you could see all the holes and frays  Those blankets were so old and worn that I would have given them away to a thrift store a long time ago  It was a little shocking because in stark contrast the linens that they DID use for the beds seemed new and fresh  Didnt make senseEverything else seemed good  Like I said if it werent for those  points I would have given a perfect score  
P => Very nice Close Quite Great staff I booked straight through riots  number and found that this place is new fresh and awesome to stay It is right down the street from The House of Blues and the rooms were quite close to so much We had a great time The staff went above and beyond just dont buy beer there go to the  around the corner it is much cheaperThe staff went out of their way to help you  Breakfast which was included was like a giant buffet with a different menu each day and it was fresh and tasty I ate way too muchWe even got an upgrade for free  
P => Better than we expected We arrived late and left early so we didnt experience any part of the hotel other than the room  We were in Room  which was large well appointed and had everything one would need when away from home The internet was free and there was a complimentary breakfast although we didnt have time to see what was served The bedding is the newer non bedspread style  The kitchen looked brand new and had hardwood flooring laminate countertops a fridge stove top dishwasher microwave coffee maker dishes and pots and pans  The bed was comfortable and everything looked fresh and clean in the room We got the room on Priceline for only  which is quite a deal for eWe give this hotel a solid  
P => Good spot downtown Pros  great location couple of blocks from Hancock building   bedroom suite was rather large and big enough for family of six front desk staff was very helpful and courteousCons  housekeeping did not replenish supplies shampoo TP kleenex etc  breakfast was set up in temporary location while work being done Would stay there again  
P => Best Residence Inn Ive ever stayed at I was very impressed at first with the room all the fixtures and furniture looked new and stylish and the tv was one of those new flat screen LCD wide screen types  My only complaints would be that the fridge is pretty loud when youre trying to go to sleep at night and that the shower although new doesnt have a tub so you cant take any baths  The breakfast and hospitality hours are pretty typical for a Residence Inn which is to say that its pretty ent for being complimentary  The location is excellent for shopping on the the Magnificent Mile and Watertower Place going to the top of the Hancock Tower jogging along Lakeshore Drive and the quotbeachquot  All in all the best Residence Inn Ive ever stayed at and I wouldnt mind staying here again if the Courtyard is too full or overpriced or if the James Hotel doesnt have one of its awesome Travelzoo deals  
P => Musical and Shopping Booked on Priceline so wasnt sure what we were going to get  Hotel is   blocks off Michigan Ave right down from John Hancock building  GREAT LOCATION  Lobby was clean and room was large and clean  Elevator alittle scary but that is normal with older buildings  Parked alittle down the street for about  dollars cheaper than valet not sure would do again  Recommend Hotel great value for Michigan Ave area  Not scary walking back to hotel at night from Cheesecake Factory  
P => Could have stayed forever  Stayed a few days here  Great hotel  Awesome location  Upgraded to newly remodled one bedroom suite on the th floor  Staff was very friendly and helpful  Cant wait to go back  
P => great hotel   great location Stayed at the hotel just after New Years   Stayed in a two bedroom suite  Very roomy and clean  The beds were so comfortable  They had said that there was construction as they are reating and we heard nothing at all  It was a Friday therefore the workers could have gone for the day  We had the breakfast in the morning and it was a delicious hot breakfast with eggs biscuits and gravy and an array of other breakfast items  Everyone I talked to at the front desk were very accommodating  We have stayed at this hotel for several years and still like this one  It is so convenient to the Magnificent Mile Water Tower Place and the John Hancock Center  It is a one to two minute to walk to all three  The Cheesecake Factory is located in the bottom of the John Hancock Center so that is a great place to eat  I will continue to go back to this hotel when I stay in Chicago   it is great JEH from Oxford 
P => Very Nice Room in a Great Building This hotel is a very nice place for a family visit to downtown Chicago  Its in a great location on East Walton just a block east of the Hancock Tower near the Miracle Mile  This hotel is undergoing reations but my room was completely unaffected by any construction noise and I didnt even see any work in progress  Work is expected to be complete by the end of il   My room on the th floor appeared to already have been updated based on the very good overall condition and the appointments in the bathroom and kitchen A hotel staff can make or break a hotel and this hotel has a good staff  very courteous and helpful  Valet parking was very quick and painless  No need to call ahead  On checkout my car was in front of the hotel in less than two minutes The management was very receptive to feedback and it was obvious that from top to bottom the staff wants its guests to enjoy their stay This hotel had once long ago been apartments and was converted to a hotel  The suites are very well laid out with lots of room and closet space for hotel guests  We had a two bedroom suite which had a queen bed in each of the bedrooms with phone and TV  The main bedroom was very large and both bedrooms had large closets  The single bathroom was a little small but a pedestal sink helped make good use of the space  The bathroom had very new white tile throughout  The full kitchen has new cabinets new laminate counter tops new appliances and a new small table set for four  The large living area had a TV with internet TV desk with hi speed internet connection and phone a chair and couch  The chair and couch appeared to be left over from before the reation and since they were quite obviously the only things in the room that were not new The breakfast in the morning was in the quotgatehousequot which for the rest of us means the lobby to the left of the entrance  There was a full breakfast with plenty of choices  Food was very fresh  Seating area was limited though  There were enough tables but it seemed that they were short a few chairs  There was almost no food available after  though so get there early enough  Im sure that management will fix that problem after I brought it to their attention Overall a very nice stay in a good location  The staff made this a painless stay Heres two tips   Valet parking is tax  I ided it was worth the convenience but there are cheaper lots within a block or two for a  hr stay of      Cab far to Navy Pier was just under  for four people  
P => Old but nice I just returned from Chicago where we stayed in the Chicago Residence Inn  It is currently undergoing a remodel which it definitely needs  However the rooms where large and clean and the staff very accomodating  It is in a great location   between Mag Mile and lake My only complaint would be that the elevators are too small for the number of people who stay there  I would recommend this motel  
P => Great location Stayed here for a quick shopping break at the beginning of ember  Great location very friendly staff  Hotel was clean and comfortable  Will definitely use again  
P => Nice place We stayed at the Residence inn for nearly a full week in ember  and had a nice stay  There were  of us including a small baby and at first we were put in a quotQueen studioquot which seemed only slightly larger than a regular hotel room and had a full kitchenette  Fridge small stove dishwasher sink It was a bit snug for   So    I went down to the front desk and asked if we could get a bigger room  Couldnt have taken  minutes and we had keys to a new room  This one had a arate bedroom nice living room lots of closet space and a slightly bigger kitchen  Was a bit more  but thats to be expected  Had a great stay  Staff was polite courteous and very helpful  The only thing I can suggest to improve the place would be the addition of a pool  
P => Absolutely wonderful hotel This hotel is located two blocks away from the Hancock Observatory and the Magnificent Mile  We my husband and  year old son stayed for three nights     in a one bedroom suite  It was huge  easily over  square feet or at least felt like it  Staff friendly and very helpful  Each morning Id ask the desk about the best bus route to the attraction we were visiting and they would give specific directions including exactly where the bus stop was  The breakfasts were excellent and filling  Very clean  We always stay at a Residence Inn when we travel and this one was one the nicest ones yet  You will not be disappointed  
P => Great Location We enjoyed our stay at this hotel  The staff was very polite and courteous  The hot breakfast is an added plus  We had our bikes and they stored the bikes for us  We went on a bike ride on the lakefront which is located a couple blocks away  We would defintely stay at this hotel again  
P => A real gem in Chicago for families This place is an absolute GEM for families staying in downtown Chicago  The free breakfast and dinner every day with free beer and wine at dinner is wonderful  We were serenaded by a staff member one morning during breakfast The staff at the front desk is outstanding  It was pouring rain when we arrived but we didnt have an umbrella  They lent us one to use during our stay   The one bedroom room was so spacious it felt like our own apartment  With three full closets we didnt have to stare at or move around our bags  The kitchen set up was perfect  The room was quiet and even had a cool view  The bathroom was a little short on counter space but it was cozy like one youd find in a home  Overall this was one of the best hotel experiences our family has ever had  The location is unbeatable    just two blocks from Lake Michigan the Hancock building the Water Works Tower and great shopping  
P => Fun Times Great Location Nice Room Helpful Staff Good Breakfast  Had a  Room Suite   Lots of room  Alittle pricey but I guess thats Chicago for ya  
P => Kid friendly We just returned from a weekend in Chicago with our  children  We ided to stay at this hotel because it was close to the lake and shopping and offered a large room with arate bedrooms  The location is wonderful  The hotel is just over a block away from the John Hancock building Water Tower shops and many other shops and restaurants  The Lake is visible from the hotels front door  The room is large and has arate bedrooms  However the bathroom is very small with a small pedestal sink  The room looks tired as does the elevator and hallways  The lobby is minimal  We stopped at the Drake next door one night for dinner and sitting in their beautiful lobby we wanted to move rooms  We also ate lunch at the next door Hilton and thought their restaurant and lobby were very nice If you are looking for a good location with room for small children this  be your spot  We will try somewhere else next time  
P => Last minute savers This review is to thank the Staff and riott for providing my family and I fantastic service and accommidations  We arrived to Chicago with reservations at another hotel and they dropped the ball  The Residence Inn riott was there to recover and saved the day  The rooms are enormous comfortable and provide a sense of home with a great view of the lake  The service was polite professional and humorous   thank you  For those of you looking for location they are located  a block from the John Hancock and a block from State Street for shopping  There is a small grocery store around the block in case you want to dine in or select one of the many restaurants in the area  Highly recommended  
P => Great value and location I have stayed at the Omni riott Sheratons and the Embassy Suites downtown but this much better Stayed for  nights in the two bedroom suite Very clean great staff and free breakfast too 
P => Enjoyed my stay I stayed here for a business trip  My conference was held at the McCormick Place so I had a  cab ride each way but this hotel made it worth the trouble  The staff is very pleasant and helpful with restaurant recommendations and directions  The rooms are so spacious and clean and I had a view of the nearby condominiumsapartments  I didnt have to look directly into another building which was nice  The hotel is in an excellent location  It is only a couple blocks from Michigan Avenue and very close to the lake  If you are a walker or runner this is a great place to exercise There are plenty of restaurants and a movie theater within walking distance  They serve free breakfast every morningwith eggs toast oatmeal etc  and free dinner cold cuts sloppy joes etc  Mon Thurs  Seems like a great value for anyone with children They take pets I enjoyed my visit and would stay here again for business  The only drawback was the workout room  It is very small and offers minimal choices  They offer use of the full service riott gym and indoor pool but that is  blocks away  
P => Good Value I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights and was surprised at the location and value  The location is perfect  it is central to many restaurants shopping and attractions  The hotel is not as upscale as the neighbouring Westin or Double Tree Hotel but offers a ent buffet breakfast and a minimal light snack Mon Thursday  The front desk also doubles as a concierge and they were quite helpful in orientating me to nearby attractions  This is a good place for children or people who will be staying a long time  They also allow pets for a fee  The studio room had a full kitchen one queen bed and a sofa bed  The customer service was very good  Unfortanetly there is no gympool facilities and you do have to go to another location for it and also pay a small fee about    I would stay here again since the price was well worth it comparing it to the other locations nearby  
P => nice place good location stayed overnight with my wife  One bed roomsuite looked pretty neat kitchen comes in handy sometimes especially if you are staying longer  We only got queen sized bed I did not bother to ask for king not sure if that is a standard or they actually have king sized rooms  Small reception desk was actually never crowded and they seemed to have had full capacity due to the radiology meeting  Parked one block away closer to the Drake   hours  Valet is day  Breakfast had good selection of food  In room high speed internet is complementary  All in all excellent place for the money paid  on a long weekend saturday  through priceline 
P => Fabulous  Residence Inn Downtown Just returned from  nights at the Residence Inn Downtown on E  Walton  We were very impressed as we were expecting an ok only spot with a great location  We were pleasantly surprised  It was spotless and very roomy   square feet for the  bedroom suite with living room and full kitchen and a great breakfast buffet included  All staff seemed courteous and extremely helpful  Everything appeared to be new and well maintained  Im really picky and couldnquott find anything to complain about We didnt take advantage of their free dinner and beer and wine that is available  nights of the week but lots of guests seemed to be enjoying it I would definitely stay there again as it is a block to Michigan Ave  and a   minute safe walk to Rush Street

P => Very comfortable Living in the far west Chicago suburbs I am often offered hotel rooms in the downtown area to use during particularly busy times trade shows etc  Having stayed in several boutique hotels mostly in the River North area I have found none better than the Hotel Monaco  The room was cleaned thoroughly every day staff was extremely friendly and accomodating and the room was quite large and very comfortably furnished  The view from the corner suite was outstanding and I enjoyed lounging on the oversized window seats  I felt like a VIP at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again  
P => Great I bid a room on Priceline and got the Hotel Monaco  The staff of the hotel was EXTREMELY helpful from directions telling about hotel services etc  Very friendly    The were a nice change of pace from the typical hotel these days  Nice to have free Wi fi  I found the location to be great  
P => Best Chicago Hotel we have ever stayed in We have stayed in other boutique hotels in Chicago a national chain and a different Kimpton here in Chicago    this by far is the nicest and best maintained of the hotels The staff is outstanding the room beautiful the food excellent  I have nothing but great things to say about our stay here  We are staying here for a week next month and are looking forward to it 
P => th Visit  Again we found this hotel excellent great views large room  spacious bath  window seats  the friendly goldfish available upon request  Very helpful concierge amp doormen  Centrally located  Return guests get bargain rates  
P => We had a few problems First let me say the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what Id hoped  There are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown and housekeeping wasnt very helpful We booked a suite and the sofa bed chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use  Ive attached pictures so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows  Comfortable it was not The chair bottom is all broken down too  I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture and a slight adjustment was made in our rate  As to housekeeping we had ordered an in room coffee service which Kimptons web site says is there but you have to specifically request and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee  We had to call the front desk every day  And housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl  I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded  These things  not matter to you but if you plan to spend a week like we did you might want to be comfortable  The bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad  
P => Would stay here again Hotel and the city of Chicago was very clean  Hotel and room orfurnishing was beautiful and functional  Housekeeping both morning and turn down service was excellent  All staff members were very friendly and helpful  Wine hour is an added bonus This is a fabulous hotel with excellent service  
P => Hotel Monaco As good as everyone says After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed  I booked through their web site about   months prior to arrival for night plus tax for a room with  queens  The location was perfect   right by the river near Michigan Ave    minutes walk to the El Millenium Park the Theater District and Shopping  The room was clean a little larger than standard and nicely orated  We had window seats in the room with a view of the river  There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening  To top it off the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area  
P => Great place Cant say enough good things about this place  From the wine reception friendly staff great location funky room with amazing water pressure in the shower   Its all good  
P => Nice Hotel for Girls Getaway weekend  I was in charge of finding a hotel for  ladies that were coming from all different parts of the US to see Chicago  We had picked the plastics convention weekend in e when many hotels were booked up in ember   I made my reservations over the phone directly with the hotel for  MEDITERRANEAN SUITE which had a king size bed and a pull out sofa bed in the sitting area  There is also a huge hot tub with jets  In addition to the suite I booked  double queen rooms one which was supposed to be adjoining to the suite  That didnt work out but the manager sent a note of apology and two free bottles of wine to the suite  In downtown Chicago double queen rooms are hard to find most are doubledouble  The suite was  a night and the double queens where  with a AAA discount  I thought the rates were high but actually this was less than the going rate for most of the hotels in the downtown area for that weekend   All the ladies liked my choice of this hotel for several reasons  First was the FRIENDLIEST BELL SERVICE we had ever encountered  They were dressed comfortably and all seemed to enjoy helping us  We lhed and joked with them as we gathered in the front of the hotel and found every one of them to be pleasant  Second was the LOCATION of this hotel  Whether the ladies flew in at Ohare or Midway they were able to take a train to a station that was only  blocks from the hotel  Some ladies jogged along the lake front in the morning as far as Buckingham Fountain  In the afternoon it was an easy walk to Michigan Ave for shopping  We took the subway to a White Sox game and again it was a short walk back to the hotel  shall Fields was also just a few blocks away  Third were the WINDOW SEATS in each room  The suite had three of them  We all gathered in the suite and several of us could sit in the window together  We had a nice view looking at the lights of the city  The Trump construction project was also part of the view   Fourth the LITTLE TOUCHES  Free chocolate chip cookies in the lobby as good as the ones Midwest Airlines serves  A free wine happy hour in the cozy lobby lounge  The big fluffy animal print robes  Spa type shampoo conditioner etc  Fifth the restaurant manager who lent us his tini glasses to use for one night in our room  Sixth the cleaning staff was great  There wasnt a spot of dirt or dust in any of the rooms    I didnt rate the hotel as excellent because we didnt get the room set up the way we wanted  If they had given us the adjoining queen room we probably wouldnt have gotten complaints from the rooms next to us for talking and lhing too loudly  Also the actual concierge misdirected us to the correct train station and was not very helpful when I asked about a boat tour down the river that included the Sears Tower  I had found the information on the Hotel Monaco web site under the concierge tab but the actual concierge couldnt find it for me when I was there  It was Shoreline Sightseeing  The bell staff guys gave much better directions and eating recommendations   Our experience with the hotel front desk staff and management was very pleasant  I would recommend this hotel for a group of women but not a group that would want to party past midnight  The mediterranean suite with the hot tub would be a great room for a romantic night with the hubby too  
P => Good Chicago Hotel I stayed at the Monaco for  nights on business  The hotel is centrally located in the downtown quotbusiness districtquot and is a short walk from Michigan Avenue shopping  PROS  The rooms are an average size for a major city but well laid out  The signature large Kimpton desk with  chairs was useful and my standard King room had two comfy chairs one with a nice ottoman    The beds are incredibly comfortable as you would expect from a Kimpton hotel   The mini bar is large   this is important to me when I travel as I like to remove the overpriced water and snacks and place my own inside   The staff was warm and welcoming and check in and check out were both easy CONS  My room I am a Kimpton In Touch member faced a dark air shaft  While this was nice due to the lack of noise there was no natural light whatsoever   Because the windows dont open the smoking rooms REEKED of smoke  I am a light smoker and usually request a smoking room  The second I stepped off the elevator I realized I was on a smoking quotfloorquot as the smoke hit my like a punch in the face Overall it was an excellent Kimpton experience and Id definitely stay here again  
P => Definitely Recommend My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco this past weekend based on the reviews from TripAdvisor  It definitely met and exceeded our expectations  The location was in a terrific spot   a few blocks from the train station and walking distance to nightlifeMichigan Aveetc  After a day out exploring we arrived back at the hotel around p and took advantage of the wine reception  In the mornings there was a short line of people filling up on the Starbucks coffee  The two best things about our room was the window box seat   we both could sit up there and look outside and people watch  The next best thing was the bed   very comfortable and gave us a good nights rest  Oh and the price was very reasonable for the room size the location  The concierge also directed us to some fabulous lounges to have a drink at in the evening  Would recommend this hotel to almost anyone 
P => Exceeded Expectations Great hotel in a convenient location  I would stay at again Pros Nice staff retains its historical beauty alongside clean spacious and stunningly orated rooms  Cool lounge too  Plus they offer fresh brewed Starbucks in the morning sorry no Continental breakfast just cups o joe  Cons Parking is  a night but be thats the prevailing rate for the Loop  Also Priceline made a crapload off me    I got the hotel for a  a night bid with close to  extra in taxes but the hotel bill revealed a  a night charge  Next time Ill try to phone the hotel directly before bidding with Priceline although I have a feeling that the hotel already had committed a set of rooms to Priceline at a certain point  
P => Very nice without being pretentious My power went out during last weeks heatwave so rather than sleep in the bathtub I got a room at the Hotel Monaco on Priceline I knew of the Monaco had eaten in the restaurant downstairs knew the location etc  I figured that if the room was half as good as the photos looked and the AC worked I would be very happy The room was huge as was the bathroom  The linens were all top quality  The colors were rich and soothing  It was much better than I expected It was very convenient for my commute to the suburbs for work but was right by all the theaters and shopping in downtown  And the AC was fantastic 
P => Nice Hotel but NOT pet friendly My mom and I were roadtripping with my dog a yorkshire terrier  Our goal while on this trip was to stay at nice hotels that would also accomodate my dog  We have stayed at way too many roadside Holiday Inns and thought we would bump it up a notch this time  We booked the Hotel Monaco due to the great reviews from Trip Advisor and the Hotels own quotPet Friendlyquot section on their website  I am sorry to say that other than the great adjoining restaurant Hotel Monaco severly disappointed  My two main greivances are   they are NOT pet friendly  I expect a pet friendly hotel to have some place to actually walk your dog  Yes I realize this hotel is in a downtown area but on our travels Mom and I stayed in Nashville St  Louis and Atlanta  All major cities   and all had places to walk your dog  Hotel Monaco had nothing close by  There is a Vietnam Veterans Memorial with quite a bit of grass that people took to using for walking their dogs but the hotel warned us and others that it wasnt safe to do that  Sure enough many bums use this area as their sleeping quarters in the evening hours  The only other pet friendly green space was blocks and blocks away  Neither my mom or I relished travelling the many dark sweltering blocks in order to walk my dog  I would never stay at the Monaco again with a pet The second major greivance I have is that my room was RIGHT NEXT to the El  Now part of my problem could be that I am not a native and so I am just not used to the sound of the EL at night but I didnt sleep a wink The El runs and runs and runs and makes the most horrible squeaking sound TerribleThe hotel itself is interestingly orated and was teeming with young hip types who were likely in town for sightseeing and shopping  If this is why you are staying here get a room NOT on the EL side of the building and you might have a great time  If you are a family or are travelling with a pet or are unfortunate enough to be on the EL side of this hotel   good luck 
P => Good Choice No Regrets Im a fan of the Kimpton hotels   this is one of three in Chicago  The location is good for someone who wants to be in the middle   to be able to pick a direction and go  Shopping is all around Millennium Park and the Art Institute are an easy walk  If you want to be in the glitzy bustling area   this isnt it  But I like a quieter retreat after a long day in the big city The staff was great the restaurant is average and the rooms were comfortable but with flaws in the design   meaning tables were in the way the bathroom was arranged awkwardly etc  The air conditioning was great   the elevators were fast   and wi fi was complimentary  It is indeed a pricey stay but well worth the bucks  
P => Close to great but still very good Just stayed for  nights in a Mediteranean suite with my wife  The hotel is pleasant and we would probably stay again  The staff was fantastic and the room was comfortable  The restaurant was good but not great  The only complaint about the room was that the bathroom wasnt very functional  It isnt huge to begin with but the majority of it is dominated by the enortmous tub   very nice  Unfortunately that leaves little room for the erate shower and the toilet is tucked behind the door in an akward fashion  Still a great value for the money and it is in the middle of everything  
P => Outstanding hotel great value for price excellent service After our wedding we went to Chicago because did not have much vacation time we are in Minneapolis  From the monent we walked into the lobby to our last day our experience was outstandingSpecial package that includes daily chilled champaige including ice in a bucket and  flutes daily box of shall Fields chocolates dairly romantic music CD daily coupon for room service breakfast from the hotel restaurant and daily gift certificates to Victorias Secret Room  Mediterranean Suite  enter into a main room that has a sofa bed TV computer desk with highspeed though we used the wireless network via our laptop  It has  bay windows with a cushion so that  people can sit comfortably and enjoy the view of the river  That room connects to the bedroom which has  similar bay windows with a seating cushion as well as a TV  The bathroom is connected to the bedroom and in pristine condition and includes a jazucci   assortment of CDs unique chocolatessnacks chicago maps etc in the room bar daily cleaning though the staff always respected Do Not Disturb signs and happily agreed to come back at a later time when request Aveda productsCheckout late checkout early afternoon rather than in the morningServices  Restaurant in the hotel for room services and dining we only used it for breakfast which was good but nothing special  However there are a plethora of dining options nearby and a taxi ride away so it does not really matter where you stay in Chicago  Concierge knowledgable friendly many guide books quickly fixed any problems with the room lightbulb fused and answered questions Doorman Lobby personel were always friendly and helpful and made you feel like a individual patron rather than someone lost among the masses as can happen in larger hotels Transportation Loop El trains including Brown line free chicago shuttles along Mag Mile taxi hailed by the doormanLocation in the loop area by the chicago river never concerned about safety 
P => Excellent hotel We stayed for two nights over the Memorial weekend unfortunately we had to leave on the Saturday  I booked this hotel based on the reviews and I also managed to get a very good rate  We liked the friendly relaxed attitude of the hotel and the staff easy check in and we changed rooms as the original option on the th floor had no view we were offered a room on the th floor which is the smoking floor  As ex smokers this did not bother us but you could smell smoke when you came out of the elevator also in the room a little bit  The view was much better this time though almost at the corner with a nice view over the river  We ate in the restaurant on the first night and it was OK if nothing else As others have said the location is great as you can walk easily to the places of interest a great option for breakfast is the Old Timers Diner which is just around the corner the dorrman told us about this place and it was just what we were looking for  We just made the end of one of the wine receptionswhich were good and the Starbucks in the morning was a nice touch  In sumy a great hotel and was not hesitate to book Kimton hotels again  
P => Really nice boutique hotel I just spent  nights at the Monaco early in e and was extremely happy with this hotel  This is a medium size hotel not overwhelming like too many giant business hotels in Chicago  The design is really nice and my room was quite large and comfortable  Bed was perfect bathroom was OK free Internet access very convenient the big plus in my opinion was the large window with an alcove that provides prime views of the river  Spent hours there watching the activity on the street and the buildings around  Downtown location was convenient not too far from multiple shopping destinations and from the new Millenium park outstanding  I wasnt blown away by the service but it was fine overall  All in all I found this hotel a great value for the location design and comfort  Will certainly go back  
P => Nice  Stayed in the Monaco for Memorial day weeekend with our  kids ages  AND   Loved the location the or and the goldfish The complimentary evening wine reception and morning Starbucks and chocolates or sweets at turn down were great It was nice to see pets in the hotel too  It is clean and beautiful and wonderful or We had a whirlpool suite room  for  per night internet deal which encompassed  large rooms plus bath included a living room with tv in armoir and minibar and honor bar desk with phone and lamp stone coffee table  comfy armchairs and a hide a bed sofa adjoining a HUGE master suite with tv in armoir huge meditation window seats queen size bed with feather duvets large paisley arm chair amp ottoman amp phone  Bath has HUGE DEEP whirlpool tub AND shower and concrete sink   COOL   with granite top  Our room was next to ice machine which was convenient and hidden so not noisy  Nice Aveda bath products in bath    wonderful  The negatives were few but will mention    lovely brightly tissue covered bath balls next to tub beckoned children to throw them in at parents chagrin Overpriced honor bar with cute little stuffed toys pringles and candy and such that could not be moved out of kids eyeshot and reach attached to armoir just under TV   to parents chagrin We were put into a smoking room when asked for non smoking   in hotels defense we did not mention and did not ask for room change and only asked upon departure whether it was smoking or not it was smoking and there was a mix up for which they apologized profusely  Also wallpaper torn where chair rubbed it in livingroom   no big deal but looks shabby  they need to repair and get chair rail  The room service took way too long cost way too much and was mediocre  The delivery guy complained that the hotel took  of his tips and held out his hand for more on top of the   already charged to the bill The parking was high  per night   oh well    its Chicago and probably not unreasonable for the area  The huge plusses besides the ones already mentioned the staff was great The restaurant was nice with outdoor seating area too better than room service  The concierge was very helpful  My son puked in the night and the housekeeping staff was really helpful with extra linens and no complaints how do they do it Overall Id have to say great stay  
P => The Monaco is First Rate We stayed at the Monaco for four days the middle of   We had never stayed in a Klimpton hotel but booked the Monaco based on customer reviews  We were pleased with our ision  From the doorman to the desk clerk to the bellman all were friendly and helpful  There was a real effort to make guests feel welcome  Our room was first class  The bed was very comfortable as were the the linens  The closet was bigger than most hotels  The bathroom was clean and the towels thick  We both liked the shower and never had a problem with hot water running out  The television had an adequate number of channels and had good reception  We were on the fifth floor above Wabash but had no problem with street noise  I would have preferred an in room coffee maker but there was Starbucks coffee in the lobby every morning  A selection of newspapers in the lobby included the Chicago Tribune the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times  USA Today was at your door in the morning  The location of the Monaco is a plus Its one block off Michigan and a short walk across the river to the Magnificent Mile  We will look for a Klimpton property on future trips and the Monaco when we make it back to Chicago 
P => Thank god for jacuzzi tubs My husband and I stayed in one of the quotMediterranean Suitesquot and it was lovely Not overly swank but comfortable with a pretty or and two unbeatable features  a great two person jacuzzi and deep wide curtained off window seats where you could sit and read or look out at the river  You really cant find that anyplace else in Chicago for the price  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Way too cute  Wonderful stay     from the doorman to the housekeeping service they couldnt have been nicer     room upgraded before i even asked      fun eclectic or and couldnt resist the mix cd  Room overlooked ina City and the river beautiful especially at night the window seats are fun and cozy to sit and watch the city  Only drawback beds were on the hard side that being said will stay there again if i can afford it 
P => One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at I spent  nights at the wonderful Hotel Monaco on a business trip  What a great place at the government rate The location was perfect  within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago  The or of the hotel and the rooms is spectacular  quite funky and refreshing  The room was comfortable and clean with a nice view of the river    The staff were extremely helpful and friendly especially Barnette the doorman  Knowing how hungry I was for Chicago information the concierge literally went out of her way to meet and greet me with suggestions  The wine served during the afternoon reception was Grade A No cheap swill  I will definitely hunt out Kimpton Hotels during future visits to Americans large cities I just wish I had my digital camera for photos to show you  
P => Happy Easter at the Monaco We spent Easter weekend at the Monaco with our  young kids and had a fabulous time  The Monaco was very kid friendly staff were great and we loved the location  Especially cool are the unique windows   they are practically a arate room all to themselves and we loved the in room goldfish  A neat touch  We will definitely stay again  Thanks Monaco for a great weekend 
P => Nice Stay Stayed at the Monaco for one night on business  I hadnt stayed at a Kimpton property before and was pleasantly surprised  Extremely friendly check in staff and comfortable lobby made for a homey feel  Interesting room or  Greatly enjoyed dinner at the attached South Water Kitchen restaurant  Will stay here again  
P => fun and whimsy at the Hotel Monaco I just returned from two nights at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago  I loved the or of the rooms   pale green and cream striped walls white polka dot gauzy curtains gold upholstered chairs   it was sumptuous and luxurious feeling but very fun at the same time  There are cute things in the honor bar like stuffed animals and etch a sketches in addition to the usual gourmet snacks  The beds have beautiful red and gold cushioned headboards and the staff provide wonderful little touches like bathrobes laid out on the beds filled ice buckets and televisions turned on to the relaxation channel when they come around for the turn down service in the evenings  Everything was immaculately clean  My favorite part of the room was the meditation window there were actually two in the room   one large enough to lie down in  Once youre sitting there you feel like youre floating above the entire city  Together all of these elements made the experience of staying at the Hotel Monaco unlike any other  I didnt have any wine during the evening receptions but coffee was thoughtfully laid out in the lobby in the mornings from  am to  am  Because I was there for a conference I really appreciated the staffs helpfulness in printing out some documents for me on the morning of my presentation so that I didnt have to trek to a nearby Kinkos  Everything was perfect   I only wish I could have stayed longer 
P => comfortable and friendly Comfortable room friendly staff wonderful location  I would stay there again  
P => Rock On The staff and service made our stay at the Hotel Monaco unbelievable  Having gone in the off season for a family event the staff not only provided us a great reservation rate but then upgraded us to the Rock Star suite  This place was awesome with a CD jukebox deep two person whirlpool giant king size bed and comfortable sitting room with Keith Moon tv through the window orative piece  The relatives took a standard room and found it just as clean quaint and comfortable   if less raucus  I cant say enough great things about our stay at the Monaco  The valets were lightning quick in retrieving the car on the busy snowy downtown street  The desk and bell staffs were attentive and sincere  The complimentary evening wine tastings were relaxing and pleasant  There was an adjacent independent restuarant with suitable food and a range of other choices just a cab jump away  Ditto for sightseeing Even if season rates are higher than you  prefer Id advise indulging in the Monaco and trying out a different style of hotel service  
P => We stay here and we live in the Suburbs of Chicago Whenever my husband and I have a special night we stay at the Hotel Monaco  We have had Valentines Day and New Years Eve there  We have had out of town guests stay there as well as in town guests The customer service is second to none and the rooms are incredible and spotless  We eat breakfast in the hotel when we stay and the food is always very good  Good choice and nice location  It is not as loud as other truly downtown Chicago hotels  Beware of the parking charge even if you do not have a car  
P => Bachelorettes loved the Monaco We went to the Hotel Monaco with  girlfriends for a Bachelorette Party  As the organizer I appeciated the friendly demeanor of the in house reservations team  I felt that the price was very reasonable for its downtown location  We loved the individuality of this hotel over cookie cutter hotels  The orating was very nice and the the goldfish and leopard print robes were a fun addition  We enjoyed the large window seat overlooking the river  The bathroom was nice and spacious  definitely a plus when  women are getting ready to hit the town  Unfortunately we were out shopping during the complementary wine reception and werent up early enough to enjoy the complementary Starbucks Coffee The concierge was very helpful with planning where to go out for the evening and she supplied us with plenty of free passes  We all cant wait to go back 
P => Amazing place to stay The Hotel Monaco is probably my favorite hotel in Chicago and one of the best hotels Ive stayed in anywhere  The location is excellent   walking distance to the Loop for business Michigan Avenue for shopping and River North for dining  Its not too far from subway stations  Cabs are relatively cheap in Chicago so its easy to get around I got lucky it was a slow week when I stayed there and I was upgraded to a huge suite as a Kimpton member  The room came with plush robes and Hersheys minatures on the pillow  The bathroom had ample space for all my toiletries  The bed was excellent and Im a picky sleeper  I especially liked the window seat  My minor quibbles The suite while very spacious was a bit oddly laid out  quotInterestingquot use of space is a common issue with boutique hotels  I happen to like funky rooms but I can see how others might not  The closet was near the door away from the bedroom and bathroom which is a bit inconvenient in a suite  The desk was placed in the sitting area in a way that sort of blocked the entrance to the bedroom  It was also kind of small and piled with Kimpton brochures and hotel info which made it kind of hard to actually use it without moving a lot of stuff around But none of these aspects bothered me much  There is a small business center with free internet access in the hotel so I never bothered to clean off the desk  I just had one meal at the restaurant bar which was fine  The service at check in was prompt and courteous  I would definitely stay here again  
P => We named our Goldfish Myrna We loved The Monaco  We arrived very early and expected the hotel to hold our bags until afternoon but there were rooms ready and they let us checkin before am On arrival we requested a goldfish who was delivered when we returned from shopping that afternoon  We named her Myrna Our first night in turn down service included a wrapped truffle and a full bucket of ice the next night offered tootsie roll pops  Returning from shopping we were offered fresh baked cookies  This style conscious hotel is filled with little and nice surprises The Doorman knew us by name even though we only had one interaction and admonished us for waiting in line at Garretts for popcorn when he would have been happy to take care of that I cant say enough about the concierges  We dealt with two both women  One aptly took care of an issue with our airline the other pointed us to shopping with discount coupons in hand We ate breakfast at the restaurant  The food and service were good although nothing extraordinary The rooms have a quirky feel to them  The honor bars include the usuals and items such as silly putty and stuffed goldfish souveniers There is no question we will stay at The Monaco on return trips to Chicago  With a fantastic location and hospitable staff it has become an all time favorite  
P => Great Hotel Fantastic Locations Friendly Staff most of them Ive stayed in Kimpton hotels before and the Hotel Monaco Chicago lived up to all my expectations  Its such a great location in Chicago a few blocks from Michigan avenue and a few blocks if you want to catch a play All the staff was extemely friendly always stopeed and said hi how are you enjoying your stay  The only expception to this was the female conceirge   of all the conceirges Ive talked to this one ranks up there with the rudest and most unhelpful   but it definitely didnt ruin our stay  
P => The Fantabulous Monaco I just returned from my first trip to Chicago and I couldnt wait to tell everyone about my stay at the Hotel Monaco The Monaco is a small boutique hotel located in what is possibly one of the best locations in downtown Chicago  From the moment you walk in to the small but stylish lobby you are greeted warmly and cordially by everyone  The front desk resembles an old Louis Vuitton steamer trunk   one of many bits of whimsy you will find here  The staff is friendly courteous and knowledgeable  Our room was clean spacious and comfortable with a lovely view of the river  My overall first impressions lasted throughout my stay The Monaco is about  blocks north of shall Fields a  minute walk if that to the theater district minutes from Michigan Avenue shopping to the northeast and the Chicago Art Institute to the southeast  Convenient to everythingThe hotel is stylish without being pretentious and eco friendly  Aveda products animal print robes and a pet goldfish to keep you company are all at your disposal  Relax and have fun hereI will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone going to The Windy City  
P => Loved The Monaco Lovely hotel  Friendly helpful staff  Rooms clean and spacious  Great location Comfortable beds  Cant wait to stay here again 
P => Absolutely Flawless This hotel is just fantastic  After years of staying at generic convention hotels such as the Hyatt and riott I can honestly say that this is a far better option  This hotel is charming but modern luxurious but causual quirky but comfortable  You wont believe the amenities waiting for you in the room Gorgeous or   and a catalogue with everything from the towels to the lamps  Were seriously considering purchasing one of the mirrors from our room for our homeIts a small hotel so the relatively small staff will remember you for the duration of the stay and they will help you with absolutely anything you can imagine  Everything is brand new so of course its sparkling and the rooms have fantastic sound proofing  You couldnt hear the sirens from ambulences down on Wacker Fantastic location    blocks to the heart of the theatre district and shall Fields  blocks in the other direction to the North Michigan Avenue area  Water Tower is only a  minute walk north and the Art Institute the same distance south  We cant WAIT to stay here again and were recommending it to all our friends 
P => Go Go Monaco Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter amp loved it  Staff were helpful amp friendly room was huge with fantastic view of the river Central location  min walk to the EL Adjoining RestaurantBar great food amp service I have stayed in more expensive supposedly better hotels in Chicago but this is the best Thanks Monaco Ill be back  
P => Give this hidden gem a try I have stayed at this hotel twice  My sister and I bring our kids to chicago for the air and water show every ust  The lobby is small but very comfortable  The front desk staff is helpful and accommodating  The bellman is helpful with his knowledge about the area  The rooms are rather large and the or is exceptional  The bathroom is clean and spacious  The kids were so excited to see a fish bowl in our room A unique touch  I think thats why we like it so much  Not a quotrun of the millquot hotel stay  The location is bonus with the Mag Mile a  block away  We hopped on the free trolly and went to Navy Pier  I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a unique hotel in a great location with excellent staff  P S  this hotel is pet friendly  The hotel manager brings her dog out for cocktail hour  So Cool   
P => FIne This was a nice property clean and most people friendly  Called twice for towels and never received any  Good location  Would stay somewhere else next time just wasnt a place I would say Im going back to  
P => Great Stay At The Monaco Stopped at the Monaco following recommendations from Tripadvisor and wasnt disappointed  Great locationattentive and friendly staff and comfortable rooms Would recommend this hotel to others  
P => A wonderful Chicago Hotel Stayed here recently on Business  Nice attentive staff clean and functional rooms  The lobby was inviting with fire free newspapers and morning coffee and evening wine  The location is great and many rooms have nice view of Chicago river  They didnt have a goldfish available but thats a minor disappointment all considered  
P => Perfect Location The Monaco in Chicago is a perfect hotel location for business or leisure travel  The property is located walking distance to Michigan Avenue so that you can shop dine or just wander about  The hotel itself is clean and funky   and everyone is extremly kind and helpful  The room that I was in had a two double beds large bathroom and nice robes  The room had windows that extended out over the building and were mini cubbies to lay in and read or just gaze   it was a very cool place to hang out  The workout room is tiny but efficient    and has a TV to watch while you are sweating  Starbucks and Corner Bakery are just around the corner and the hotel restaurant drew quite a lunch crowd   and the food there was really good  I love this hotel and will make it my first choice to stay when I travel to Chicago  
P => Very nice    highly recommend  Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in ust and loved the hotel  Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour and the accomodations were quite nice our beds were very soft and comfortable  We had excellent views of the river from our rooms  The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town with easy access to public transportation nearby  My friends actually received the goldfish upon request which they enjoyed  Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above but it was minimal  Price seemed very resonable to us for the location  Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again  
P => nice overall   a bit pricey I stayed at the Monaco for five nights in ch   My room was a tad on the small side but the appointments were quite nice overall though the or  be too whimsical for some  This is supposed to be a pet friendly hotel but I take that to mean chihuahuas and not much else  Nevertheless I didnt hear any barking dogs  ch is not exactly peak season in Chicago so the vacancy rate was probably a bit on the high side  Some of the rooms have little ledges overlooking the street and thats kind of nice  There is a convenience store located across the street so pretty much anything you need in terms of food and supplies can be had easily and cheaply  The location was good El and CTA stops within walking distance if you want to come in from OHare or Midway  Most places near the Loop are also easy to get to  Michigan Ave is just a block and a half away I would say that the Monaco was an above average experience though I did not feel I got a fantastic deal for the price  
P => Service I love the Hotel Monaco chain especially Seattle but Chicago is terrible  I just stayed there ust    st and found service lacking and the staff apathetic  Both requests I made during my stay took hours  On Friday  th I requested a yoga basket for my room at  p m  It arrived at  p m  while I was dressing to leave for dinner  This was after being told quotwell send one up immediately quot On Saturday  th I arrived back in my room at  p m  to find my hotel goldfish dead in its bowl  I called the front desk and was told that they would send someone up quotimmediatelyquot to get it  At  p m  I took the dead goldfish and its bowl down to the front desk myself receiving no comment from the staff at all My pillowcases had old mascara makeup stains on them and were not that white and clean looking I asked the conceirge to recommend a great Italian restaurant it is Chicago after all  She referred me to the upscale Bennigans like Nick and Tonys chain around the corner  On Saturday night I left the hotel to go out for the evening single woman alone and had to hail my own cab on the corner as the doorman couldnt be bothered The advantage of boutique hotels over chains is service  Despite other reviews on the great service of Chicago Hotel Monaco I didnt see any  This will definitely taint my opinion of Kimpton hotels which is unfortunate  
P => All You Could Want and More Checked into the Hotel Monaco Chicago following an exhausting wedding not mine someone elses  From the valet to the bellman concierge to the front desk   the staff was excellent and very accomodating and helpful especially considering that they were running crazy due to the large number of guests in town for the air show that weekend I had made reservations quite a while in advance and so had gotten a reasonably good deal   Ask for a room on a high floor in a corner away from the elevator  I got room    a very large room albeit with no view   I was looking at a brick wall   but it was on the top floor and it was SILENT up there   no screaming children no noisy neighbors nothing Considering the hotels  star reputation I would have expected a little more from the bathtub it was smaller than my apartment tub at home but it was clean in good working order and had good water pressure I ordered room service for breakfast and although it was pricey there are some reasonably priced options and I HIGHLY recommend the pancakes  For  you get  enormous buttermilk pancakes with fresh fruit real whipped cream and real maple syrup  I also got cappucino with my breakfast and found it to be just to my liking Overall I got my moneys worth and more from this hotel   and it is well within walking distance of the theatre district and both shopping areas the Mag Mile and State Street  A great find 
P => Comfortable hotel but expensive and nothing amazing       This hotel was comfortable and the service was fine  It was fairly expensive booked at the last minute for business travel at  for one night and  the next night  The lobby was funky but not large  I had stayed at the  which is right around the corner on an earlier stay  The room I got at the  had a fabulous view and Id probably try the  on my next stay if I end up in the same section of town One cool thing was the yoga channel on TV    an endless loop of a yoga class  Unfortunately the yoga gear that was promised mat accessories was not in the room and I didnt bother to request it  
P => Great value great location wonderful We stayed here back in e  Celebrated our  years anniversery in Chicago and reserved a suite with a jacuzzi  The price of the suite was very reasonable considering up a few more blocks north on Michigan Ave on the Magnificent Mile wouldve cost about a couple of hundred dollars more per night  The location was great  Just a short distance between the Magnificent Mile up north and the musuems down south on Michigan Ave The people who worked there were very friendly and helpful  The suite has a FANTASTIC view  Were planning on coming up to Chicago again shortly and plan on staying here  Next time though were taking our dogs with us  Did I mention this place is dog friendly   
P => Places to Stay in chicago Embassy Suites  I am pleased to say I have stayed in a lot of hotels but The Monaco is very affordable a very nice comfortable and relaxing hotel with the suites there are jacuzzis in the bathroom and close to clubs restaurants and magnificent Michigan Avenue  I recently stayed at the Embassy suites and it is also very comfortable affordable and relaxing the lobby is outstanding when you walk in it seems like your still outside it has more of a party atmosphere than a lobby  There is a great restaurant right downstairs and it is also located by the nightlife chicago has to offer  If your looking for affordable plus comfortable these to places are definitely places you would like to stay  
P => FANTASTIC hotel  very fun stay My extended family stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate a wedding in the city  We were not disappointed Every aspect of the hotel was wonderful  The eclectic or the friendly staff the free coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings the comfortable lobby  this hotel has all the elements of an excellent boutique property  The rooms have large window seats excellent for reading relaxing or just watching the busy Chicago traffic The concierge gave us excellent tips on nearby eateries and helped members of our party find their way to the museums  I would echo other reviewers in saying that the hotels restaurant the South Water Kitchen was disappointing  The food was less than stellar and overpriced and the service slow The hotel however was outstanding  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Charming Hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel Monaco for a weekend getaway  The hotel staff was courteous and helpful with suggestions for dining transportation etc  The hotel room itself had lots of character and was very charming  The only downfall to our trip was the hotels restaurant the Southwater Kitchen  We waited  minutes for our breakfast to be served in the restaurant and finally got up and left  Id definitely stay here again 
P => Enjoyed our stay Our stay at Hotel Monaco over Memorial Day weekend was very nice  The staff was wonderful   very helpful and friendly  We flew on a red eye flight from San Diego and therefore arrived at the hotel very early in the morning  The front desk staff was willing to check us in early if we were willing to go for a king size bed and we would have a view of the river too  Unfortunately because it was two friends travelling together we opted to wait until the afternoon to check in so that we could have two double beds  The rooms were adoreable and the beds extremely comfortable with down duvets  There are two window seats in the room which made for some great relax time especially with a view of the river and the city  The bell staff and conciege were also very friendly and helpful and gave us some good recommendations for dining  jazz clubs  etc  While in Chicago try RUMBA restaurant on hubbard street  It was unbelievable with live music and dancing on Saturday night  Make a reservation and dress well   its pricey but very well worth it  b 
P => Terrific place This was our first trip to Chicago  The Monaco was fabulous  Check in and check out were simple  At check in we asked for and were given a room with a view of the river  Very romantic room good sized with beautiful or  Afternoon wine was great   wish we had been less shy and had taken advantage of chair massage they offered  Concierge was great   got us reservation at the classy restaurant at John Hancock building for fireworks at the last minute  Location location location was fabulous  Easy access to museums Magnificent Mile river cruises Millenium Park  Major sights are very walkable from hotel even with blisters from ill fitting shoes or easily accessible by bus from Michigan Avenue  Dont miss quotthe beanquot at Millenium Park  Will definitely stay at other Kimpton Hotels   we were very impressed  Although there are other terrific Kimpton hotels in Chicago would stay at Monaco again because of the super location and river view  
P => Excellent We live in a Chicago suburb and needed a day away so we stayed at the Hotel Monaco  What an excellent hotel with great service and a stylish and clean room The Hotels location couldnt be better with Millennium Park Michigan Avenue the Loop and Navy Pier within walking distance  The complimentary evening wine tasting was nice and our really cool companion goldfish was delivered during what the front desk called their  p m  goldfish run  Ask for a quiet room to avoid the loud late night folks and the elevators  Also use the excellent concierge who seemed to know all the sales and store hours for places in the area  We visited my sister in law who was staying at the Swissotel on Wacker Drive at the same time  While her room had a better view it didnt have half the character or the same excellent service that we enjoyed at the Hotel Monaco Im becoming a big fan of Kimtpon Hotels which owns Hotel Monaco and other really interesting and fun boutique hotels in Chicago and around the country  
P => Very Nice Hotel I stayed at the Hotel Monaco    for a conference  Check in was painless  The staff were friendly and helpful  The room was quiet non smoking spacious furnished with a king bed reading chair desk and chair and television hidden in a large cabinet  The bed had a down comforter and many pillows  There was a wildly colored bathrobe in the closet  Towels were large and thick  There was an in room safe no refrigerator  Wireless internet was free and fast  The offer of a goldfish to keep company for the night was too interesting not to try but after calling twice at  and  PM and being promised a goldfish one never showed up  One of my colleagues reported a similar experience  I took advantage of the overnight complimentary shoe shine  In the morning going to an  AM meeting my shoes were not back  They came back about  minutes after I called requesting them  Meeting rooms were fine  The service with the food for the meetings was terrific  Food at the meetings was abundant and very very good  It was a nice hotel to stay in and a good one for a meeting  
P => Nice Hotel in a Great Location Romantic comfortable quiet and our room with a view of the Chicago River was in a great location Check in was very cordial and the afternoon wine tastings were a bonus Since Chicago is one of the best walking towns in the world the location was fantstic  within walking distance of the jazz clubs on Hubbard St  the sjhops on the Magnificent Mile and the parks off Michigan Avenue  
P => Memorable Monaco Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic  Very convenient for walking to museums shopping and park nearby  The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view  We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel  Helpful staff wifi Aveda products ent restaurant downstairs for brunch easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location  I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel for business or pleasure  
P => Good Value Great Location Terrific experience We just returned from our first stay at the Monaco  Having read all the reviews I was curious as to what my impressions of the hotel and staff would be  I found the staff to be friendly and helpful  even at the concierge desk which several reviewers had blasted  Our room was cheery clean and spacious  The hotel located just around the corner from the El lines and Metra so getting around was easy  And as far as the complaints that it was too far to walk to Michigan Ave  those reviewers must not walk at all at home  Michigan Ave  is a five minute walk  I would definitely stay at this hotel again  It had everything I want from a four star hotel and is a good value for the price  
P => Wanna go to Monaco My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for  nights in celebration of our th anniversary  Everything was fabulous   our room overlooked the Chicago River great French o furnishings Luxury bed linens great service and walking distance to everything  The only icky thing is our quotpet goldfishquot which is a cute perk to staying at the Monaco was belly up upon our return one night  The replacement fish was found in the same condition the following night  Yuck We did get a good lh out of it and do plan to return  
P => Fantastic Monaco I am writing this from my room in Hotel Monaco at the end of a long weekend in uary   All in all the hotel has lived up to my very high expectations Towncar transfer was arranged perfectly check in was a breeze I was up in my room before I knew it  As I had requested I had a high floor room overlooking the river great view from the window seat  oration of the room and hotel in general is colourful a nice change from generic chain hotels without falling into annoyingly trying to hard to be hip  Bed is very comfortable nice bathroom with Aveda amenities  One of the things I liked most about the hotel is all the added amenities  Every morning free coffee and tea free wine in the evening turndown service etc etc  Staff are very polite  Nice touch was also the discount card I got to redeem at my next stay at a Kimpton Hotel to me that is an incentive more than some frequent guest programs where you need to stay numerous times before you can have the benefits  Location of the hotel is also great within walking distance of everything   in contrary to other reviewers I found the walk to Michigan Av to be absolutely no problem at all  I would highly recommend Hotel Monaco 
P => Alright For The Price Ok my husband and I stayed at the Chicago Hotel Monaco New Years Weekend  The man at the front desk was very cold so were the women at concierge    when they were actually AT THEIR DESK  The location isnt that bad but next time I think I will stay directly on Michigan Avenue  The walk isnt too bad the first time but we couldnt move by the time we were finished shopping on the Magnificent Mile and we had comfy shoes on so we had to take a  cab back to the hotel and we continued taking cabs for the rest of our stay  The hotel restaurant South Water Kitchen was great for breakfast a bit pricey but everything is pricey in that area  We ordered extra shampoo and towels    never received them  The mini fridge was stocked well but the little goodies bin looked like the goodies have been there for years  Dusty with crumbled wrappers  The bed was comfortable and we loved the down comforter the bathroom was a ent size  The window seat was a great touch except for the stains on its pillow top  We paid  a night and I think that was ent for what we received all the other hotels were   We were out most of the time so it wasnt too bad  The lobby is small but nicely orated free starbucks coffee in the lobby was too strong again front desk was rude  Overall if you pay  or less you are more or less getting an OK deal  But I would suggest that you put a couple extra bucks into a nicer hotel on Michigan Avenue where everything is happening  Oh and we tried the world famous popcorn    great popcorn but not worth the  minute wait in line  Navy Pier was nice 
P => Very Pleased I stayed at the Chicago Monaco on Halloween night   The location is great  Easy walking to shops amp restaurants amp not far from the bus stop  As usual the Monacos are beautifully orated  We enjoed excellent service amp an evening wine reception  The restaurant South Water Kitchen had served a wonderful breakfast amp a delightful staff  They are a pet friendly hotel as well  They offer a business center which allows free access to the internet  The rooms are a little larger than normal  I would return with out hesitation  KA Snodgrass AAA Travel 
P => Superb My family and I satyed at the Monaco for one night and had a wondeful time The hotel was in the center of it all  The staff was friendly form the check in to the valet  We love the window seat and spent all the morning lookig out of it  We had a suite and it did not let us down  The colors were vibrant and inviting very comfy The bathroom wa also gorgeous  The jacuzzi was relaxing and the bath products scented the room the whole stay Overall WONDERUL 
P => THE BEST OUR TH STAY in  years     This hotel is a gem  We visited Chicago at Thanksgiving every year for at least  years before we found the Monaco  Now its our hotel of choice  Perfectly located betw Mag Mile amp State and close to Ronnies Steakhouse for breakfast  The window seats w the river view are to die for  Staff is always very nice  No waiting for elevators  My only complaint is that I cant get the Hot Rates Hot Dates in the summer so I could really enjoy Millennium Park which is only a short walk  Wish I could afford to become a permanent resident of the hotel  
P => Good value Just spent two nights at the Monaco  Very good hotel and Id stay again  Some of the criticisms in the thread below are just unfair and harsh e g  fwiw the front desk LV replica is NOT shabby I prize the following in a hotel value convenience cleanliness and ambience Pros and cons as I saw it Convenience arrived at Midway on Southwest at   Took our carryon bags straight to the Orange line   fare one way  Made the mistake of transferring to the State line although we ended up in the new Pedway and exited through the shall Fields  my wife thought that was a good thing  The hotel is only a block or two away from the El station an easy walk even with bags  Gate to door time was about  minutes and was  minutes on the departure since we took the Orange line directly to the airport  I think Chicago is a very easy town to navigate but the hotel location makes it extremely easy  The in room maps made finding our eating locations and walking strategies easy to figure  Concierge gave a very accurate estimate of how long it would take to cab to Charlie Trotters finding a cab on a wet Friday evening in ember was a challenge we walked over to the Wrigley building and cht one after about  minutes  Cleanliness  the room was spotless  Be aware that this is an old building and there is some sound transmission from the halls to your room  We had room  with an excellent view of the river even with our early check in  The bay windows are nice  Most of the noise actually came from other guests who thought nothing of allowing their doors to slam behind them  Staff was very polite and appreciative when we gave her a tip at the end of our stay  Ambience  a pretty good effort here  I like the Kimpton approach having stayed at the Argonaut this summer in San Francisco  Kind of an eclectic or  The room was comfortable the bed was fine theres about  cable channels no HBO  Did not dine at the hotel or the adjacent restaurant  Did eat at the Corner Bakery just down the street  All staff were fairly friendly  Business Center on the third floor had free internet access and a printer no printer from the front desk computer so we could checkin with Southwest online and get our boarding passes ahead of time  Value   this is one of the citys busiest weekends no discounts of significance  Paid  per night and felt good about it at checkout  Paid two and a half times that for a single meal at Charlie Trotters and incredibly felt good about that too  No question Ive stayed at hotels with higher ks but often with a notably higher price tag  I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago and liked it but would return to the Monaco first  The Kimpton group is usually willing to exceed any discount you can find on the Net so be sure to ask when you book If youre a reasonable guest with fair expectations unlike some of the whining Ive read here I think youll have a good time  
P => A little disappointed My wife and I brought our dhter downtown for a blowout quotAmerican Girlquot Weekend and chose the Monaco because of its glowing reviews  We arrived late and be thats when they put out their second stringers but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff  like we were an intrusion  Ill never understand this  theyre in the hospitality business and theyre inhospitable This is getting picky but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance  The repeated quotHMquot initials are peeling off  looks like they used rub downs where they should have silk screened for durability  When we got to our room we found the maids ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed yuck  Im still trying to figure out that scenario  There were no ashes  so Ive ruled out spontaneous combustion  Also to the disappointment of my dhter the much advertised goldfish was MIA  The bellhop who apologized for the shoes explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed quot   is that OKquot he said  I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking   fish to make a tired  year old happy  On the up side the rooms are nice and have an over the top oration that my dhter loved quotId like to live herequot she said  The bed is VERY comfortable  my wife wants the same brand now  The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower  except for the cheap fall apart while youre using it toilet paper  Come on Kimpton How much can a ent roll cost The view towards the river is great try to get one and my dhter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window  she closed the curtains and was in her own quotclub housequot watching the world go by from from high above the city  In short very nice hotel  desk staff at night could be nicer wouldnt cost anything and would have made up for the maids shoes 
P => Must ask for larger room Their website gives the impression that they have two and only two types of rooms regular and suite  The rooms actually come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes  When checking in we didn t make any specific request so we got a narrow room with a bed that was too big for it and no view to boot  Lesson learned    specifically ask for a big room and a river view or at least a view out on to Wabash Avenue Also definitely take them up on their offer of a free pass at the gym down the street the exercise  room  is more like a closet  And the curb in front of the hotel gets crowded so dropping off luggage can be an adventure  The bellhops do their best but someone directing traffic would be better  
P => Wonderful locationor I just returned from Chicago where I stayed at the Hotel Monaco  It was a great experience  The hotel is in a great location close to shopping and theatres  The or is really great so different than all the other boring hotels  They even give you a goldfish for your stay if you want one    how unique  From pm to pm there was wine hour in the beautiful lobby  All of the staff was very friendly and the Concierge was so helpful  Id recommend this hotel to anyone and plan to stay there again  
P => Amazing hotel in every respect In e of  we held our client conference at this amazing property  Being the one that coordinates everything for these conferences I was invested in this property before I even laid eyes on it and hoped for the best  I was hardly disappointed From the moment we arrived chocolate chip cookies and all everything was perfect The staff is energetic and extremely helpful  The rooms are amazing the or is top notch and the meeting facilities are superb From my pre conference planning up through the post conference follow up this could not have been a better experience The rooms are extremely comfortable and all the ammenities are top shelf  Aveda products in the bathrooms window seats with spectacular view I had one of the Suites of the river amazing beds and linens and a very functional workspace with highspeed wireless internet to boot   I couldnt have asked for moreIll be back next time for a vacation and Ill bring my family  
P => Lovely  Lovely  Lovely Outstanding We were in Chicago for a performance at the Chicago Theater and were delighted to find this charming hotel was just a couple blocks away  Hotel staff was very pleasant the or was quirky and wonderful We stayed in a Mediterranean Suite Room    highly recommended  It had high ceilings three cozy window seats that face out on to Wacker street very comfortable bed lovely bathroom with a big whirpool tub Aveda products etc  Just perfect  And we also made a request for one of their pet goldfish that are cared for by the Shedd Aquarium  The fish was a fun addition to a wonderful stay   even the mini bar items were terrific 
P => Clever friendly hotel I really like the Kimpton hotels and this is like any of them   a ent value boutique feel with some fun sleek and even tongue in cheek furnishings  Rooms are nice about what youd expect with some really nice views of the Chicago river and downtown  Its not my favorite of the Kimptons out there but its still a nicer and more interesting experience than most of the business or leisure hotels youll stay at  Note a full menu room service ends at  PM    which is a bummer if youre just flying in late  
P => Perfect location spacious rooms great price We were nine ladies that were grade school friends celebrating our th birthdays in  so took a trip to celebrate and reconnect  Found Hotel Monaco on SW Airlines web site and got a great price  It has a fabulous location friendly staff very large rooms great fun and a little funky or not cheap but nice restaurant and bar attached with seating out front that was great  Happy hour with wine in lobby was great as well    we couldnt have have a better trip 
P => Lovely Stayed there for Valentines Day loved everything about it  Staff was efficient and extremely helpful service   top notch  Enjoyed our room too   tasteful or albeit a little on a small side  Go Kimpton 
P => Fine hotel good price We stayed in the Hotel Monaco for four nights in early tember  We were very pleased  The staff is friendly  The room while not large was nicely done  We had a room overlooking the river and could sit in the large cushioned window seat and watch the world go by  The hotel is within a block or so of the Els on the loop so tranportation is easy but far enough from the trains so that there is no noise  It is also only a block from Michigan Avenue and thus close to the parks and the best shopping  Jewlers Row and shall Fields are also near by  
P => Top notch A truely pleasant surprise Not having any prior experience with Kimpton Hotels my wife and I were delighted with our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago  Convenient location at the north end of the loop near the river and a short walk away from the Navel Pier and the Magnificent Mile  Highly recommended 
P => wouldnt stay anywhere else As regular visitors to Chicago this is the only place we would ever stay  Great rooms good service and good location  Best value in town 
P => Excellent Service I was staying in Hotel Monaco from st of y until the th of ust  The staffs are very friendly and room is spacious  As they knew that I needed a very early check out the next day they exactly delivered a print out of my check on my door step the next morning  One minor thing to mention the refrigerator is making a lots of noise at night  One of my colleague even unplugged the refrigerator so that he could go to sleep  
P => Theyve earned our loyalty Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends I was disappointed initially to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didnt have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat  eve  BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it Gave us cab fare to get the  blocks over there  Paid for our valet parking  that eve  So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve when they did have room we said yes  When we returned they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our  quikbook rate Now thats what I call a recovery 
P => Outstanding Hotel Monaco was outstanding My husband and I were celebrating his th birthday and we couldnt have been more pleased with our choice of hotels  We had a suite hot time in the city package   night overlooking the river  The rooms were exceptionally clean comfortable and colorful  The bed was very comfy and the window seats were wonderful for sitting and drinking coffee in the morning and watching Chicago come alive  The wine tasting was a nice perk and the restaurant next door had excellent food  The staff was very attentive and courteous and the concierge was very patient and helpful with our many questions about the city  We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Chicago  
P => Superb Stayed at the Monaco for  nights at the end of e in the Mediteranean Suite Absolutely perfect with superb staff  Nothing was too much trouble 
P => Hotel Monaco was great I stayed at The Monaco with several friends to celebrate my best friends birthday  The lobby was beautifulour rooms were terrific  really great window seats   The only complaint would be with one of the guys at the front desk  what a little snot he was equally rude to all of us on different occasions  however the rest of the staff was very helpful  Ive also stayed at The Burnham anothertruly outstanding Kimpton Hotel these people really know how to create a lovely enviroment  
P => The only place well stay in Chicago While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before this was my husbands first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time  Well the second stay was even better    we had one of the corner suites on the river    the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful  The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing  Unfortunately we missed the wine hour  One thing that realy impressed me is that bc of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late    Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation  
P => Go with the Suite My wife and I stayed at Hotel Monaco for  nights at the end of e  We went with the suite for about night  It was well worth the extra money  This was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in for the money anywhere   including Four Seasons and The Plaza in NYC  We received a corner suite that was huge with large bay windows overlooking the Chicago River and up towards the Mag Mile  Room was tasefully done and very clean  Service was friendly and location is right off Michigan close to everything and the Blue Line Train from OHare  The only minor complain I can think of was the bathroom was a bit small for a suite I would stay here again hands down and highly recommend the place  
P => Perfect get away hotel The Hotel Monaco was a perfect romantic get away It was exceptionally quiet and comfortable  The cozy and charmingly orated room had a wonderful view of the river and city from the cushioned bay window  The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly  And the location was centrally convenient  It is the best major city hotel we have ever stayed at in the USA 
P => Not enamored by this hotel  Stayed at the Hotel Monaco over th of y weekend  When booking months in advance I requested a quiet room  Upon arrival found room faced a brick wall with a very large and noisy air handler  Room was ent sized  There were no window seats  Just  window with no seat which is understandable because there is no view  The bathroom was huge and everything was spotless  The bed however was one of the worst I have ever slept in  Very soft and sagged in the middle  It was ironic seeing that all linens were top notch for this abominable bed  It is hard to tell if the lack of sleep was from the bed or the loud air handlers  The next day I requested a different room  The desk was very courteous and prompt in responding to my complaints  We were moved to a much smaller room which did have the  window seats  You could hear a lot of traffic noise as you are facing the street  Fortunately it was not too bad  Unfortunately the bed was just the same as the previous room  Terribly soft and sagging in the middle  We never heard any noise from neighboring rooms  However the hallway noise can be loud  We never ate at the restaurant on site because I thought it was rather pricey  Across the street is a deli and around the corner was a Corner Bakery The or in the rooms is top notch and fun  I like that they use duvet covers which are changed daily  After seeing  minutes where it crucified the hygiene of comforter covers in hotels i e  the amount of bodily fluids on these comforters which are not typically washed on a regular basis I am relieved to see the duvet covers  The location puts you walking distance to everything  The staff and concierge were very helpful and welcoming  Since My husband and I travel to Chicago at least once a year we like to try different hotels  I liked the Hotel Monaco but did not fall in love with it like many other writers  I found the Swissotel similar in price and location  Although it lacked the ecclectic or and outgoing staff I found it to be far more comfortable with larger rooms outstanding views top quality beds and very peaceful  I will probably return there next time  
P => Loved It After reading the reviews on this hotel I ided to book my stay for y th weekend here and I am glad I did this hotel is absolutely beautiful  Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows  I do have  complaint  The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great but other than that I loved it  I would definitely stay there again  
P => Sweetest hotel ever And Ive stayed in several nice places My  friends and I drove up to Chicago to see the Clay AikenKelly Clarkson concert in ch  Since Ive been to Chicago many times since I was a little girl they entrusted me to make hotel reservations  A month or so before wed all seen the Hotel Monaco on the Travel Channel but figured it to be too expensive  Well needless to say it isnt expensive for the luxury you receive From the moment we stepped inside even as young unpretentious looking college grads the staff greeted us and made us feel like wed stayed there a million times  I must say I fell in love with the tall bald man at the receptionist desk Hes hilarious when you talk to him I wish wed had more time there We were greeted with hot fresh chocolate chip cookies   which definitely won us over  The room was beautiful   had a gorgeous view of the river and there were  window seats   one ended up being used as a bed for the evening We could have stayed in the room all day and just watched the city go by outside  The orations were ecletic and fun   exactly what I hate that other hotels dont do  It felt homey from the minute we walked in  And Aveda toiletries   you really won my heart with that Those are some quality products I cannot WAIT to come back to Chicago and stay there   be even in the rock star suite Oh and I cant finish this review without expressing my love for our goldfish which we affectionately named quotMoonshadow Yates quot What a truly fun experience Thank you Hotel Monaco Ill DEFINITELY be back soon 
P => A Great Home Away From Home I just spent three lovely days at the Monaco Hotel at Wabash and Wacker Drive in Chicago Illinois As a speaker for the Food keting Institutes annual convention we were given reservations at the Monaco Hotel  I looked at the hotel map and said quotOh one of those old downtown Chicago hotels  I wonder what thats going to be likequotWell as a frequent traveler was I surprised  The hotel was beautiful clean and extremely friendly The large rooms were orated with exquisit taste and the bed was wonderful  It reminded me of a very high price European hotel  As nice as it was the best thing of all was the staff  Yes from the door man Bernette to the desk clerk Ryan to the wait staff in the restaurant maids turndown service staff I was treated like Royalty As a frequent business traveler I am a Diamond Elite with the Hilton and a Gold with riott but I can assure you that the next time I have to stay in Chicago I will be a GUEST of the Monaco Incidently while I was there a movie was being produced right out in front of the hotel which caused quit a traffic jam and alot of site seeer as well as all the movie production staff  The Monaco staff was fully trained to handle the situation and it was not an inconvenience to any of their guest Thanks to all the great people that have made this a premier hotel in the loop of Chicago  
P => Romantic and Funky Hideaway Just stayed over Valentines Day  It was a real romantic treat  The staff was very friendly  Room was funky and cool loved the striped walls amply stocked goodies and giant round mirror  strategically placed too  Look for the complimentary CD 
P => AMAZING Ill save you time by just saying   amazing I travel all over the world and this is one of the if not quotthequot best hotel I have ever stayed inand that is not even considering the price That is saying a lot I live in the Chicago area and I stay here for a mini quotgetawayquot very often  The prices service and amenities top all the rest 
P => PERFECT GREAT FANTASIC  NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN Well worth the money The hotel staff was great very nice and friendly  Conversation was so easy with them they treated us like we were old friends  Could have talked with them forever  They were helpfull with pointing out where things were gave great directions  The suite had fantasic wonderful four huge window seats  The car was always brought out in a prompt manner  The bed was the most comfortable bed ever even the sofa was so comfortable  I was talking a rest from shopping and ended up taking a four hour nap without knowing  I would recomend this to anyone  We will be back several more times in the future  The store across the way has snacks and drinks that are cheaper then the mini bar and the people that work there are very friendly also  Love Love  love this place  Think about my five days there this past week and I just smile 
P => Wonderful experience What a wonderful hotel A friend and I took her  year old dhter to Chicago for Christmas shopping ember th and th  We all ided the highlight of the trip was the stay at the Hotel Monaco  The beds are the most comfortable Ive ever slept on in a hotel the bathroom is huge the or is very tasteful and the enormous window seats afford an amazing view of the city  The staff is very accomidating and friendly  Its a luxury hotel experience without the quotluxuriousquot price 
P => weekend shopping get away My girlfriends and I visit Chicago every emeber for a wekend of shopping and eating  The location is great  We could walk just about every place we went  The hotel was so fun  I love the or  The wine in the lobby in the late afternoon is such a nice touch  The window seats in the room were great  Large rooms and very clean  Loved the Aveda bath products  Loved it so much that my husband and I will be back for a week long business trip and will be staying at this hotel again  I cant wait 
P => Absolutely loved it AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME My boyfriend and I loved everything I suprised him for his birthday because hes never been to Chicago The or was sooooo cute  The in room whirlpool was NOT a bathtub it fit both of us comforably and hes quot We sat up at night and over looked the city in the big window seats the employess were soo nice and helped us with directions for attractions And to warn you its  for overnight parking but well worth it 
P => Great place very romantic Hotel Monaco was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at  My husband and I stayed here for the weekend for our th anniversary  It is a very romantic place  We had a suite with a  person hottub a arate living room and a king size bed  The rooms have these wonderful window seats that I enjoyed so much watching the city go by  We had a great view of the river  We bought a romantic package I think it was calledquot ooh baby babyquot and we recieved chocolates to die for a cd of romantic music champagne and the best part breakfast for two days in our room We had great breakfasts eggs etc  made to order  The beds are so comfortable not your average hotel bed  The rooms are orated pretty funky but I liked it  The only thing I would change is the hot tub in bathroom wont run if the lights are on which is not all that romantic  Other than that we loved it 
P => Awesome hotel  
P => The Monaco is so comfortable  
P => Loved Hotel Monaco  
P => unacceptable  
P => Loved the Monoco   fish meditation windows and comfort  
P => Incredible Value  
P => Wonderful Suites  
P => Posizione perfetta stanza splendida  
P => 
P => Good Staff is very friendly rooms are nice with great view of Chicago River and close to House of Blues and Harry Carays Resaurant as well not far from Magnificent Mile  Hallways were dark and elevators a bit scary but overall great hotel  The bar Crimson located in the hotel was not great  The bartenders were nice but the waitresses were like talking to a wall  
P => Nice hotel good location great deal We stayed  nights for night including parking which is usually day  Room was very nice bathroom was spacious  Nicely appointed and very comfortable overall  We requested a quiet room and a refrigerator and got exactly that  Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating    Rich one of the parking attendants was kind enough to drive us to a show we were running late and then park our rental car  The only complaint is about the morning coffee service in the lobby  First the coffee wasnt very good freshly brewed but cheapslightly sour    I roast my own beans at home so I  pickier than most  Second and more importantly the coffee was not only taken away at am which seems early to me should be am for those who sleep late but one day I arrived at am to find it had already been removed  Third they allow both the coffee and creammilk to run out  Guests shouldnt have to notify hotel staff when theres no coffee AND no cream  That said I would stay at the Sax Hotel again in a heartbeat at anywhere near this price  Recommended P S  Theres an Einsteins Bagel place less than a block away for better coffee but only slightly the usual bagels and yogurt wgranola for a quick and easy breakfast etc  
P => A good hotel with a good rate   good times This is a nice hotel  It is quotclosequot on a lot of categories so if you get a good rate you should chose this as a possibility  Here is what close means  The hotel is close to being very good close to good neighborhood close to having very good service  Would this be the first choice   close but no  It is a pleasant hotel  the rooms are nice  the neighborhood is  blocks from nice  Having House of Blues  feet away is close to being quiet  Overall I liked the hotel and paid  a night and would stay again at that rate or lower  Because the hotel is not great not great service not a great heighborhood not great sound proofing I would not stay at   Hope this helps  
P => Excellent Hotel for a Great Price My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Sax for  night while visiting Chicago   Overall a wonderful experience a stylish boutique hotel Pros Great price due to the economy  parking was included from a deal on expedia com Very nice aesthetics throughout the hotel lobby rooms etc  Rooms were nice and stylish comfortable beds  Victorian meets Modern  Right next to the House of Blues  Pin Bowling and Bin  Their own Crimson Lounge is nice though Im not big on drinking Right by Michigan Ave  Right by Shaws Crabhouse where we had dinner EXCELLENT EXCELLENT place to eat Interactive entertainment lounge with every current video game system hooked up to LCDplasma tvs including a rock band instrument set and BEER available   Cons We were given a double room instead of one with a single bed that I booked we were tired when we got in so we didnt care    Im sure this could have been fixed  No baths in our standard room just a shower in case you cared or wanted to relax and have one  Kind of dim halls I didnt know if this was meant for ambience or not  Interactive game room closes too early though Im sure my wife wouldnt want us playing video games on our hotel  Not much else to say honestly For an average guy like me this is a very nice hotel at a great location at a good price  I will definitely return here in the future and recommend it to others especially if you want to catch a show at the House of Blues right next door  
P => Funky or ent location and free Reeses Pieces in the lobby Spacious rooms beautifully orated very courteous staff  I would definitely recommend it to a friend  Expensive Parking     block walk to the subway  
P => Very Nice Hotel What a surprise  We stayed here through priceline and loved every minute of it  We have been to many Chicago hotels and this one is in the top   The room are nicely orated  The lobby and hallways are awesome as well  The front desk and guest services employees were very nice when we interacted with them  Nothing bad to say about this place The building itself is old  Our toilet had running water once or twice and the windows could use some fixing but overall cant complain We tried Bin  and A Mano and both are good places to eat  
P => Funky or and fab services The hotel sax was a wonderful treat  I had seen mixed reviews before going but really enjoyed my stay  Since I was driving the hotels com free parking offer tipped the scales for me  I arrived early am and they were able to let me check in early  The location is central  The room has some unusual or but the bed was comfy  The free internet was also a nice plus  The gym was small but offered enough for me  If I have another conference on this side of Chicago I will definitely return  
P => Fabulous Sexy Downtown Chicago Hotel Everything about this hotel was outstanding  The service was beyond my expectations   the bellman took great care of our car helped us get taxis gave directions and even remembered our names during our whole stay  The room although small was lovely with a window that could be opened and a fabulous bed  The whole hotel was very swanky and sophisticated  We didnt try the bar inside the hotel but there was a great steakhouse just across the parking lot who served up steak and lobster at pm after a Cubs game  We will definitely be back 
P => Chic and Eclectic Just visited Chicago and stayed at the Sax Hotel by a friends referral  Im from California so I welcomed the quotswankyquot feel of this hotel  When you walk into the lobby it is very modern with lounge music playing and a smell of incense in the background  The staff is very young and chic they probably hire models for this hotel  LOL One of the floors has a business center with wall size flat panels laptops and gaming consoles  I thought the gaming consoles were a little strange I guess they cater to a younger clientele  Nonetheless very chic and the Chicagoans fit right in to make this an interesting place to network even if its just to check your email  The rooms have snake skinned chairs s looking beds that are huge and a small radio that also looks like it was from the s  Turn it on though and its a blazing Bose system that will rock your room Mini Bar has the cutest bottles of Patron Tequila I thought that was a nice touch    At night visit the Crimson Lounge downstairs  Great music with lots of nooks to hang out with friends  You need to be dressed pretty hip to mingle in that crowd Lots of fun loved it  Across the parking area outside is the house of blues  If you stay at Sax you get to visit for free  You also get to visit the private foundation room at HB pretty neat place make sure you book it through the concierge in advance otherwise they wont let you in Just around the corner are some fantastic european style restaurants  Very good and healthy  Walk down the riverwalk and there are great steakhouses and Dicks last resort  I hope you visit I loved it Oh and each room has an X box I thought that was weird but I thought Id mention it  
P => Great stay We stayed for  nights at the Sax and treuly enjoed every minute of it  We received an upgrade to a ior Suite which was spacious and very trendy designed   huge flat screens a fabulous movie selection great when you suffer from jet lag and a spacious bath room are some of the incredible features of the hotel  The Bar on the ground floor is a hot spot and the games roo on the th floor is great idea Concierge was very knowledgable and helpful  
P => Great Hotel and Service   Parking Rate HIGH Just spent one night at Hotel Sax and had a great experience  The rooms are large well furnished and chic  The bathroom is very large well lit and a had great shower head  The fitness center is up to date and had a lot of space in it  Hotel Sax is is a pretty trendy place as its adjacent to the House of Blues  Its right in the heart of great restaurants theaters shopping and other attractions  The service was excellent too My only complaint was the parking charge      for overnight Id definitely stay there again but will either take public transportation or park down the street at less than half the cost  
P => Unique think swanky or friendly staff My husband and I checked into Hotel Sax on the Friday night of Labor Day weekend  We had booked the room on Priceline and check in was effortless  The dramatic red lobby set the tone for the hotel  very dim moody lighting  The assortment of live betta fish inhabiting glass vessels under the front desk were a nice touch as were the Hot Tamales free for the taking  Upon checking into the room we loved the or  Bathrooms might be a little dated be not entirely redone when conversion took place but are very generously sized  The guest rooms are also roomy and the bedding is comfortoble  I loved the chandelier al on the wall not to mention the varied wallpaper patterns  some metallic  throughout the hotel  Really life just feels more glamorous while sitting in a faux snake skin upholstered chaise louge  We had a nice Some might find that sort of thing tacky but be they should lighten up a little  Hehe  Crimson the hotel barlounge was beautiful  we found a comfy couch on the Sunday night of our stay and the mood was very relaxed music was just right  We walked into the quotTechnology Experiencequot room and it was an interesting idea but we didnt stay long  Really I cant think of a single complaint  The view was good the location was great and the hotel itself was like any other  One caveat valet parking is  a day  
P => another visit to the Sax   and it didnt dissapoint This is our fifth annual visit to Hotel Sax and although I have reviewed it before I feel compelled to do so again  We booked our trip on travelocity and it was extremely reasonable to fly and stay over Labor day weekend  as always the concierge front desk and the bell men were helpful and friendly  We stayed on the th floor in a room with a king bed  The room was clean spacious and the bed was comfortable  The only complaint is that the bathroom sink was tiny and there was no room to set anything on top of it without it falling in the sink or on the floor  The maid service was slow but i would imagine they were full for the long weekend  we had wine and cheese purchased from Bin in our room during two nights of our stay and it was awesome  the people are friendly helpful and quick in getting you your order to go  we had never done this before and will definitely do it again next year  the hotel is close to everything and is in a great location  for breakfast there are many options since room service is expensive starbucks einstein bagel accross the street and the huge mcdonalds down the road  i love the hotel sax 
P => great spot for romantic getaway My wife and I did our first anniversary in chicago and stayed at Sax  The rooms were very nice and the location was great  Very close to train that made the rest of the city readily accessible  Also win walking distance of lots of cool shops restaurants etc  The staff was very helpful with directions and maps for getting around a city we were completely unfamiliar with  
P => Great location Great room Stayed three nights at the Sax and everything was better than expected  Room was big clean and modern  The bathroom was huge a big plus for my wife  Elevators were fast staff was exceptionally helpful just a very pleasant stay  The location could not have been better close to Michigan Ave  within walking distance of great bars and restaurants  Really can not figure out why this Hotel is rated this low  Need to check your statement on departure had some problems but hotel made adjustments  Other reviewers had this problem too  Again I would stay on next visit to Chicago and cannot understand why hotel is rated so low  
P => GREAT SERVICE GREAT DEAL Fabulous place to stay I was nervous after booking bc of the mixed reviews I had read but the location was perfect and they had an INCREDIBLE package deal    quotthe Windy City packagequot  For  a night we stayed in a superior king room a  gift certificate to any of the hotel restaurants PLUS valet parking  per day was included  Couldnt beat that price We stayed Thursday through Saturday night    the deal isnt weekend exclusive like some Book through the hotel site for the deal I think its offered through    Its not available throught the quotbargain bookers sitesquot   The lobby of Hotel Sax was beautiful  All of the hotel staff members were incredibly helpful kind and considerate  I had read complaints in some reviews about the dark hallways   they arent neon if thats the issue  The wallpaper is a patterned silver and has a nice reflective quality    yes the wood is dark but I never had problems seeing The superior king room was plenty big with comfy beds amp clean and ample bathrooms Of course the mini bars are expensive as some have complained  Stop at the  eleven down the street and grab snacks  Were not room service people either really who is in Chicago   too much to see and do  The shower is a small tub about half of the conventional size tub  If you are looking to soak then you probably wont be happy  Absolutely NO complaints here  The room was exactly as it appeared on the hotel website  The hotel was quiet even with the clubs downstairs  We were on the th floor and couldnt hear any of the noise  We had a great meal at Harry Carays and lunch at Bin on the hotel  The hummus at Bin was great    but the service was slow  We went right at opening for lunch though  The Crimson Room seems like a hopping place but my husband and I arent into the club scene  We found the hotel to be convenient to walk almost everywhere  It doesnt have that quotchain hotel feelquot and thats what we loved about it  No coffee maker in the room but they serve Intelligentia coffee in the lobby in the morning and it was excellent  Loved Hotel Sax     Architectural Boat Tour our of Ogden Slip was great as well as the night shoreline cruise for viewing the fireworks at Navy Pier on Saturday night summer  If you love Chicago style pizza check out Giordannos    also recomment Portillos on Ohio for great sandwiches   
P => Cool hip comfortable Loved this hotel  Small enough for a boutique feel but large enough to provide some of those amenities that are nice to have from the big hotels such as wireless internet free gym room service etc  The hotel or was really cool and hip and personally I really appreciated the change from sterility from other hotels  Not everyone  like it but I found it to be a welcome change  Room was clean and well kept with a big flat screen tv nice alarm clockradio that you can plug your iPod into with an adapter cable and a nice big bathroom  Had a great view of the Chicago River  Only downsides were the lack of a coffee maker in the room although they had free coffee in the lobby in the morning and there wasnt much in the way of being able to store your clothes and travel items  The in room bar seemed a bit overprioritized and over priced and  have come a bit at the expense of being able to offer a bureau to store clothes but it was a minor thing  Bed nice and comfy with really soft sheets  Free wireless internet was a nice touch and made me feel like I wasnt being competely nickel and dimed  Location could hardly be beat  Warning at night the place is hopping so be prepared for that and consider staying elsewhere if this might bother you  
P => Great hotelamazing bar Great hotel great location  Rooms are very modern and funky  The best thing about the hotel though is the bar Nicest bar I have ever seen Well worth a visit  Location is just a short walk from Michigan Ave close to river cruises  I would definately recommend this hotel  
P => Great Location Good standard of Hotel right on the river walk in the centre of Chicago  Rooms were adequate size and clean  view from room was oklarge windows allow a lot of light in and made the room very airy  Staff V helpfull  Would recommend as prices were good also  Dont eat in the restaraunt it was very over priced and the standard of food awful 
P => Chic Trendy Sophisticated     Not so Clean The Hotel Sax is exceptionally located in the River North area of downtown Chicago ideal for concertgoers of the House of Blues Chicago and within easy walking distance from Michigan Avenue shopping many restaurants and activities within The Loop  Our room had divine views of the Chicago River  The hotel lobby and bar are luxuriously orated in a sophisticated yet modern vintage or appealing to the eye  We loved the or of our room too    very different from standard hotel or trendy and fun  Unfortunately the service was substandard  We only stayed one evening and we know Chicago fairly well so this was not a problem for us however we experience much better service in other hotels in the area  The bathroom needed a more thorough cleaning and there was crud stuck to the wallpaper  These arent major inconveniences but certainly soured our experienced for what was reported to be a five star hotel  I recommend staying at a discount    we found our room for half the normal rate    or looking elsewhere in the area  If you like cozy and comfy with coffee in the morning this is not the hotel for you  If youre edgy and require little by way of service check it out  Overall its a cool hotel  
P => Great Location Trying to Please This is an older hotel which has been recently reated in a funky style  Relatively small rooms and bathrooms but nicely done  Good toiletries ProsLocation in ina City close to River North restos  Great concierge Catherine and door staff  Housekeeping delivered an extra pillow  minutes after requested  Coffeetea in lobby on weekday mornings  Comfy linens and bathrobes  Flat screen TV  Technology lounge with X Box Wii Guitar hero   computers in the lobby for free Good deals incl  parking on Travelzoo  Entire staff is super helpful friendly very knowledgeable  if they didnt know an answer theyd check it on the internet for us  Free wireless in rooms ConsSmall rooms  No coffeetea maker in rooms  No coffeetea in lobby on weekends  Bathroom had no room for personal washkitscosmetics  Dresser top full of for purchase drinks amp snacks leaving little room for personal storage  No makeup mirror  View of the parking k at ina City  Dark dark hallways  be this is hip Our room key was shut off at pm a day before our scheduled departure  Our quotfree parkingquot showed up on our bill at day  Overall would stay there again if I got a great rate parking included  Otherwise Id head to the Amalfi for larger rooms free continental breakfast  
P => Lovely and Unique Got a great rate through Expedia  The hotel was very lovely and unique compared to other similar options in the area  Nice robes and toiletries in the room gorgeous wallpaper in the halls and room comfortable bed and linens  Not sure what vibes they are trying to send but it reminded us of Disneys Tower of Terror ride   in a good way long halls with faux candle lights picture of woman wskull in elevator etc  I will definately stay at the Hotel Sax again 
P => Excellent     This was our second trip to Chicago and we chose Hotel Sax after reading reviews on tripadvisor Its near the river and theres lots of restaurants and bars in the local area  All of the main attractions and things to do are within reasonable walking distance  Its not cheap but we booked through hotels co uk which meant we got a good deal so it was more reasonable  The bar at the hotel   The Crimson Lounge   is really classy and livens up later in the night The restaurant does a really good brekkie in a relaxed atmosphere and the evening menu looked nice although we didnt get to try it out  Its an eclectic type hotel with quite dramatic or   rooms are lovely and its really quiet so you can get a good lie in  We got a room upgrade and the room had a nice view of the river was spacious and had a well appointed bathroom  The mini bar was expensive though The staff at the hotel were very accommodating   both before we arrived and whilst we were there   making reservations and recommendations  They arranged an airport transfer for us too I would certainly recommend this hotel for a leisurely stay in the fab city of Chicago  
P => Great Hotel but bring your own quality Toilet Paper I ided to play the Priceline com Hotel Roulette game and landed Hotel Sax for a three night stay  I was a little nervous since Ive never heard of the place  But when I arrived from Midway airport via the Orange Line I was happy to find the place was clean classy and a great location  Its about a two block walk from any color Rail line you want  However parking rates are insane  a night Give me a break  Does that insane rate come with a full Wash and Hand wax I would recommend not renting a car and using the CTA Trains  As for the staff They were great  I kindly asked them for a River View and they gave me a great room No room has the quotPerfect Viewquot but the staff upgraded me without a charge In the room Loved the bed the bathroom and the HD Television with a big selection of channels  On the down side The Maid forgot to put toilet paper in my room one night and didnt replace the glass cups I used  Rip off warning The mini bar prices are crazy  On top of that they add    Chicago ultra high sales tax Hotel Sax Just make it a flat rate for us poor tourist My other picky issue      Hotel Sax needs to offer better quality Toilet Paper of all things Yes Picky but for a upscale hotel The Toilet Paper in the room reminded me of a public Restroom  Just bring Northern T P  from home and your all set grin 
P => Weird vibes This hotel gave us weird vibes  I like cutting edge modern hotels but this one was just a little strange  Our room was orated like a pied a terre owned by Liberace Crazy wallpaper and furniture and an ink blot chandelier painted on the wallpaper  Very strange  The staff cleaned it well and the bed was comfortable  Internet was free which was very nice but the check in people knew little they had a hard time giving us directions and telling us anything about Chicago  Additionally the quotworkout facilitiesquot if you could call them that were little more than a storage room in the basement of the hotel with  treadmills and  elliptical trainers  Very lameThe location is very good right next to house of blues ina City Magnificent mile you name it Being centrally located was great  But overall we enjoyed the more classic comfortable Intercontinental more  Overall this hotel is ok  It  be the perfect place for you if you enjoy trendy modern stuff  There is also one of the hottest hotel bars in Chicago attached to it  Although this bar gave us weird vibes too as it is a mix of young girls being hit on by sketchy older male hotel guests  Also beware hotel can be loud as the walls are thin and this bar is loud  We had several bar patrons staying in rooms on our floor and they kept us up almost all night long 
P => Definitely NOT worth it  Stay somewhere else  Here is an absolutely unbiased review I was there for a National meeting and stayed here even though the meeting was at McCormick place  I stayed in room   It is really dark and depressing in the room and musty and dirty as well  The bed was way too short for me im    not a giant and when you sleep on the bed the bottom sheet comes undone immediately and isnt really fitted and the comforter is cheap not a nice down one  Theres some dirty cheap leather pillows on the bed  The room is not well lit uncomfortable and the bathroom is cold and not clean  An old pack of Rolaids was stuck in the corner of the room if the hotel reads these CLEAN THESE UP  It was a total of  a night    so overall it was terrible  There are many many better hotels that are actually much cheaper  Dont stay here pick somewhere else  I spend much less in a Westin    I left to stay here I was so sick of the SAX and even though I dont think Westins are that great it was at least comfortable with ent beds and shower  The SAX was cheap dirty cold and overpriced  
P => Good Times At The SAX We booked the Hotel Sax priily because of the positive reviews on this site  Check in was prompt efficient etc  rooms fairly spacious and clean  Only complaint would be a lack of storage   the hotels website claims that a double double room sleeps  comfortably which is true but if they got rid of the outrageously overpriced mini bar  we didnt indulge  this would create more room  Only other issue of note was noise from a party in the room next to ours at  am which when we rang reception to inform them of same resulted in no action being taken as the noise continued for a number of hours  In fairness to the hotel they compensated us adequetly when we mentioned it the following morning  We had our  dhters with us   and   so couldnt make use of The CRIMSON LOUNGE but it looked like a food place to go  On an extremely positive note my dhters teddy bear was accidently cht up in the sheets and disappeared off to the laundry company and after quite a number of phone calls both were reunited after approx  stresssful hours Hats off to all in housekeeping front desk and even the bell boys for a great job  Checked out the STUDIO and it was a popular place to hang out  BIN  is also good for breakfast evening drinks etc  We engaged the services of Katherine the concierege who got us a   discount in tickets for the BULLS at the United Centre so all in all we would use the hotel again   internet ports in the lobby proved very useful also  
P => Loved my room I LOVED the Hotel Sax I stayed here for  nights for a business trip and spent most of it in the hotel because of my meetings and the bad weather outside  My th floor room was large with a nice view of the Chicago River  It had a very comfortable beds fluffy towels nice bathrobes and great toiletries  It was silent in my room    I couldnt hear people in the hallways the TV next door or the traffic outside  And despite being on the th floor the elevators came very quickly  Good wireless connections and free Internet access with printers in the lobby so you can print out boarding passes and the like One minor complaint   The room is lit by about  lamps so to get the lighting level I wanted I had to walk around the room and turn them all on My only complaint about value is the fees tacked onto the room service bill    I order a  salad and  pizza and got a  bill  They also have the snacks and mini bar drinks on some sort of touch sensitive tray so that they know when you touch them which is a bit much  
P => Funky but worth it  I usually stay at the Palmer House or Drake when I am in Chicago but opted for this little gem because they had a special of   with free parking which in Chicago is worth  a day Check in was a breeze front desk staff and and everyone I came in contact with was super  Room was a little small  but nicely furnished large plasma TV on wall very nice  Quiet area good dinner choices within a block  Easy CTA bus service into the loop They also gave me two drink coupons which I used in the Crimson Lounge which is a large nicely furnished bar area  Free internet terminals are available in the lobby Workout room was okay three treadmills three elipticals and some free weights  Two televisions mounted on the wall no headphone jacks  I was the only one working out so it wasnt an issue Definitely somewhere I would consider again  For weekend visitors parking on the street is free after  p m  on Saturday all day Sunday until  a m  Monday  I had no trouble finding street parking if you dont get free parking in your rate Cheers ius 
P => Great little Gem with a GREAT location Booked our room via Priceline and was overall a great experiencechoice  Can not say enough about the location   close walking all River North Michigan Ave Loop  Great or   a little unual and modern  Very comfy bed with robes slippers and a VERY expensive mini barSince we booked via Priceline I knew that we get a room for  usually a King  So I emailed the hotel and received a wonderful response stating that our reservation had been changed to a double to accomodate our  year old  Well   that didnt happen The gal at the counter was pretty much   take it or leave it were sold outLiked  pin next door and found cheap for chicago standards parking at the Sterling Lot  block away  The lounge in the hotel Crimson was pretty swank and crowded after   Nice and not overly priced Overall I give it  stars as there are way better hotels in Chicago that get  I would definitely stay here again Overall great stay  
P => Very Enjoyable My husband and I booked  nights at this hotel through Hotwire for our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised  The customer service was friendly and helpful from the beginning  When we first walked into our room with queen bed I truly loved the or online pics dont do it justice but was disappointed that there was only a shower stall with no bathtub   I am  months pregnant and was completely in need of a good soak My husband called the front desk and requested an upgrade   they moved us into a larger room with bathtub king bed and even a better view   all at no extra charge We had a couple of maintenance requests during our stay and the staff continued to be friendly and helpful resolving all issues within a matter of minutes  Valet service was also great although a bit expensive but its the only  hr parking nearby that allows unlimited in and out privileges in case you do need to drive somewhere The Microsoft Room game room was a great bonus   my husband loved it Also the little extras in the room were a nice added touch i e  bathrobes safe plush bedpillows My only recommendation is to read the hotel guide as soon as you enter your room to know what additional charges you  incur during your visit   from things like making local phone calls to consuming the tempting snacks on the deskbar area  Also call around for reservations for area restaurants since many do not take walk ins Overall this was a great hotel that we would definitely visit again  
P => Great hotel Booked this hotel via priceline for  per night  Overall it was a great experience  Location is great    hotel is located next door to Harry Carrys and the House of Blues  Many other restaurants and shops are within several blocks  Positives Unique or    not your typical cookie cutter hotel Quiet sleeping rooms flat screen televisions nice bedding amp ambience extremely helpful staff    bellhops amp concierge were greatNegatives Very limited room service menu It would have been nice for the basic mini bar items to be available at a lower cost i e   bottled water  cans of soda We would definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Chicago 
P => Fantastic Hotel The hotel was very accommodating for my business trip to Chicago  The service and hotel amenities were great  The staff were very helpful with accessing outside restaurants and directions  The room was very comfortable and bathrooms were huge  The hotel workout room was great  
P => Love this place We just returned from a  night stay at the Hotel Sax and we had a great experience  We got a fantastic steal on it through Priceline and we were worried at first after reading the mixed reviews here  Yes its not your typical boringly orated hotel   its fun and hip  I thought the room itself was beautifully designed and the entire hotel has a cool vibe to it  The Microsoft studio was a lot of fun and completely different than any other hotel lounge  In addition I loved having the free use of computers in the lobby as well as in the Studio to check maps and restaurant menus  The concierge was extremely knowledgeable and helpful  She recommended a restaurant about  blocks away   Vermilion   that was amazing  We would have never chose this restaurant on our own but it was probably one of the best meals weve ever had  Oh and the blueberry ricotta pancakes at Bin  in the hotel are totally worth the price This is a great place to stay in downtown Chicago  close to everything and completely safe  
P => Hotel Sax   Funky  I stayed at the Hotel Sax from ust th   t h and enjoyed my stay very much  I had stayed here  years prior when it was the House of Blues and appreciated the reorated rooms  I felt like i was staying in a gingerbread house when it was the House of Blues  Check in was super quick and friendly  Benjamin was the bellman who brought our bags to the room and he was not only friendly but was quite knowledgeable about the happenings in Chicago that weekend In the lobby they had a small table set up with a water pitcher for a refreshing glass of lemon water one day and cucumber infused water the next  Nice touch  All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and would stay here again  
P => Hotel Sax was okay My husband and I stayed at the hotel sax for  nights in ust  I have mixed opinions about the hotel  While we were kind of neutral about our experience and wouldnt stay there again I can understand why others would love it  The hotel is very trendy and chic  We stayed in the deluxe king room  The goods The bed and pillows are super comfortable  Prob the best I ve ever had in a hotel  The staff was very friendly  Both check in and check out was seamless  The rooms were really clean  The hotel has a really cool amp young atmosphere  It s in a great location  It s only a block away from the downtown nightlife and if you re planning on a trip to the house of blues it s pretty much in the same parking lot  It s a little further from Navy Pier and such than other hotels are but it is walkable we walked it andor taxis are cheap  Great flat screen tv The negatives The rooms were small and dark compared to what I ve stayed in before  There was zero counter space or hair dryer in the bathroom  The  atmosphere  wasn t really our style  It kind of has the atmosphere of a  party  hotel in that there s a pretty well rounded bar in the room the  Studio    which is like a high tech game room Crimson Lounge is downstairs a very popular club the House of Blues is across the street etc  There was nothing wrong with this but for example  it wouldn t be a place I would ask my parents to stay  Our telephone wasn t working and the ac started clicking really bad for awhile  They missed our wakeup call but called and apologized  The walls are a little thin and we could sometimes hear the tv in the room next to us  Besides the hotel cool things to do in Chicago of course go to navy pier and stay for the fireworks  Take one of the boat tours  We took the sail boat one  Looking back probably would have done the more traditional ones  The zoo is only so so but good for kids  Look for the hot tix location to get discounted theatre tickets  The staff pretty much know what s showing at every theatre in town  We saw  Alice  at the looking glass theatre  It was fantastic and great for kids and adults  The green mill was a really cool jazz bar with a lot of history I guess it was Al Capone s old hub  Don t go there if you want to drink and party though  They ask people not to speak while people are playing  Wrigley field was AWESOME  Andy s Jazz Club was tons of fun and there s other bars in its proximity that was our one night of staying up too late and drinking too much  Overall I would definitely go back to Chicago  I feel there s a lot we didn t get to do  
P => Fabulous Sax Swank sophisticated and grown up    They really did a great job remodeling the former House of Blues Hotel  Flat screen TVs in the rooms were impressive but what we really enjoyed was the Crimson Lounge  We had such a great time relaxing at the bar while listening to some fabulous music What sold us on booking this hotel was their really cool virtual tour url httpwww hotelsaxchicago com The Hotel Sax url  
P => Good hotel in great location The Hotel Sax is hip with great slightly gothic I kept thinking Interview the the Vampire meets upscale bordello meets a display of Grandmas crystal or and a helpful staff  The rooms are small but functional  The blackout curtains comfortable bed and flat screen TV were appreciated  The hotel has one of the nicest mini bar setups weve seen for this level of hotel tini shaker glasses and all the trimmings for a fee of course champagne and cocktail glasses good selection of liquor and bottled water along with candy and the usual snacks Particularly for the price we got with Priceline wed certainly stay here again  The hotel is within walking distance of Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River  The valet staff was especially friendly and helpful  
P => Loved the lounge downstairs    Stayed there for  nights on business travel  Initially did not get the room I had asked for king size bed but this was changed relatively quickly  Very nice located and for those liking Blues this hotel is located some  meters from quotHouse of Bluesquot only  th floor conference facilities are a must to see   especially the big screen they have installed  Crimson Lounge   live music every day and good dj starting pm  Looks like this is currently one of the places to go in Chicago nightlife   
P => Hotel SAX Chicago the BEST place to stay in The Windy City My husband and I visit Chicago at least   times a year to visit his family  Though we have stayed at many hotels downtown Hotel Sax is by far our favorite  First and foremost the location within the city is ideal  Located on N Dearborn it is walking distance from Navy Pier Magnificent Mile etc  House of Blues is Hotel Sax Chicagos neighbor so time your stay according to their schedule and youll only have to walk across the parking lot Located inside Hotel Sax is Bin  a FABULOUS wine cafe with great wine cheese flights and other fare that can be paired with the perfect wine to suit your taste  Crimson Lounge is a new chicago nighttime hotspot that even has its own quotsignature scentquot  Well known Djs frequent here and other musical guests perform  There drink list is out of this world and though we didnt have time to order from the menu  it sounds to die for Another location inside of adjacent to Hotel Sax is pin Bowling Lounge  Think tinis and fingerfoods instead of beer and pizza though they have that too OUR ROOM Room   Amazing  We didnt want to leave  flat panel TVs mounted to the wall that consists of varying patterns  very modern eclectic  The sitting area was large enough to accomodate a small get together though it was only my husband and I    A spacious desk with free WIFI and informative city guides and the best room service menu Ive ever seenThe back wall was made up of a window that  when opened provided a view of the city  Breathtaking The bathroom was incredible Large enough for a family spacious enough for the two of us  A double vanity with products specially made for Hotel Sax  A stand up shower   again big enough for   with ideal water pressure  There was also a large tub with jets oversized towels and perfect water temperature My stylish husband even said that he would like to make our bathroom at home look like it with the beautiful vanity with black ble top  the black and white tiled floor the textured wallpaper and the beautiful curtains can we include the view of the Chicago tooPARKING Close accessible easy    pricy  night  Parking anywhere in Chicago is not cheap  Usually we park a few blocks away but your car is usually not accessible     and who wants to drag their luggage through the city We used the valet for parking and paid the night to park and just griped to each other about it lol  We liked knowing our car was right there and that we could get to it whenever we needed it  What can you do Its Chicago ComplaintsNot really   Location Perfect  Room Perfect  Staff Perfect  Style Perfect  Ammenities Perfect what happened to Crunch Fitness Center though  I didnt get a workout in during our stay If I had to muster up ONE complaint   it might be the pillows  Not the best but my husband sells mattresses and pillows  so I  be a little spoiled  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were a little flat  but if that is the only complaint then all in all I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Hotel Sax Chicago  You wont find a hotel that provides what Hotel Sax does  Hotel Sax in my opinion is by far the BEST place to stay when visiting quotthe Windy Cityquot  
P => Treat Yourself to Luxury  Book a Stay at the Hotel Sax I believe the Hotel Sax is my favorite hotel in downtown Chicago  I have stayed many places in the area but the Hotel Sax offers an extraordinary experience  From the time I pulled into the driveway I was wowed by the level of professionalism and warmth from the staff  I knew the staff by name and they treated me like I was welcomed and my needs were a priority  Charles the valet was more than courteous and helpful  Our housekeeper Tonisha made us feel at home and took care of our personal items with great care in additon to leaving the room spotless and well stocked  We had the pleasure of having a few drinks in the Crimson Lounge and met Brad and Matthew the host and bartender  Our room was beautifully orated and the bathroom was huge  The shower head and water pressure was fantasticThe extra two bonuses to staying at the Hotel Sax is the parking and the House of Blues  I paid ONLY   with in and outs for my entire extended stay This is simply unherad of in downtown Chicago  The House of Blues is literally  steps from the Hotel Sax  Check out their website www hob com to see scheduled events  I will be a returning guest whenever Im in Chicago  
P => half good half bad I stayed here  nights in   The Bad half I had arrived early and let them know I was there check in was  and so I joined my party who had their rooms  I waited until  to go up to the front desk and was told my room was not ready and they would call housekeeping to get an update  In the meantime she started to handle another guest while I stood there so I sat down on their couches and at  was motioned up to the desk  Now it was ready they apologized and asked IF I would like a complimentary breakfast  I was still in a good mood said it wasnt a big deal and said thats okay turning it down  As I walked away I thought why didnt they just give it to me why do they ask me if I want a freebeie What they are doing is telling me they dont want to give away anything unless I am cheap enough to accept  Its just never happened to me like that and I thought it was odd  A couple hours after claiming my room I was in a state of undress and hear a knock  While I was grasping for clothes and before I could even say just a minute the door opens and it is a hotel employee not knowing the room was taken obviously  He got halfway in the room I am female and could hardly speak English enough to apologize and quickly shut the door  I didnt report it because I thought no harm done it was a mistake and made sure I had the chain on for the rest of my stay  One morning for breakfast I joined a party of three at a table who had just ordered their breakfast  Knowing that I didnt ask for a menu I just asked for a cup of coffee  Twice  In the meantime he brought them their food etc and never got coffee for me  It was like he was ignoring me because I came late and wasnt expected  So dont expect any special consideration from servers here  they have a high expectation of protocol  The cream on this crappy weekend came when I got home and for a whole week had  taken off my credit card as a quotholdquot meaning that amount was taken away from my purchase ability  I called the hotel and it was their room hold for incidentals  I had checked out on a Sunday yet by Thursday it was still on  They said it is up to the bank to release it  I dont know if that was a story or not my company paid for the room so that  was for my snack bar and movies I didnt use any of extras and I checked out on Sunday so I dont know why the hold took so long to clear  I didnt call my bank to verify who really is responsible but I am in my s stayed in rooms around the U S  and Italy and this has never happened  It is like this hotel is too good for their own clientele and doesnt trust them   If you a good person go with the flow and not demanding or a diva you  get taken advantage of like I felt I was  I probably should have done more to make a stink about all these issues as they happened people cant take advantage of you unless you let them  However I am of the Show me attitude and if you dont I wont come back and will tell everyone I know how crappy I was treated  We are as dangerous as demanding customers  The Good Very nice rooms clean and good bedding And a nice view  Good location  
P => Great hotel   Wonderful staff I stayed at the hotel Sax from y    Unfortunately my wallet got stolen in the Metra on my way to the hotel  The staff had been extremely helpful in assisting me in obtaining a police report etc  Special thanks to Bernard responsible for security  My husband and I appreciated every moment of our stay  great room on th floor very comfortable bed and cleanliness everywhere  But service is really what makes the Sax different  smiles politeness and willingness to help Well certainly choose the Sax again for any future stay in Chicago  
P => Fun and Funky I always have my doubts about these trendy urban places    but Hotel Sax was very nice Went with a girlfriend for a ladys weekend  They upgraded us to a bigger room    which was a nice size had a ent view and windows that opened There was a big flat panel TV and a huge mirror and two super comfy beds  We got champagne one night when we walked into the lobby which was nice  Because of the club on the first floor it was a little zooy but you couldnt hear anything up in the rooms  We also went to the Bin and had a great dinner  This is in a very nice location    close to a lot of things  My only complaint was that we asked for a late checkout because of delayed flights and they told us it would cost  Ive never heard of that before and was rather annoyed  But otherwise this was a great location for a jazzy little weekend in Chicago 
P => A five for being different Our first booking through www skyauctions com and it worked out perfect Great service the receptionist on arrival  Concierges  Housemaid  The lounge  The room itself  Complimentary coffee every morning  Complimentary sparkling wine in reception in the evenings  Complimentary internet and the Microsoft gaming room  Big plasma with lots of channels  Comfortable beds  Spacious bathroom with nice bath amenities  Next to the house of Blues  During the weekend lots of people coming to the Crimson lounge in the hotel and the House of Blues but could not notice the crowds when we closed the door to our room  Just a ten minute walk to the Millennium park and a stroll to Michigan avenue  Several restaurants in the neighborhood A different experience five for being different making it highly recommended  Well done SAX  
P => Great Hotel Great Hotel very stylish  Excellent staff  Room was fantastic  Bar downstairs very good  Excellent breakfast at Bin  downstairs  Location was excellent  Definitely go back to Chicago and would stay here again 
P => How this ever was rated a  star hotel I will never know We ended up at the Hotel Sax as a last minute booking because after staying at the Doubletree Magnificant Mile which was FABULOUS and was only a  star for  days we ided to extend our vacation by a day and were thrilled to score a  star       until we got there  Upon checking in I did inquire if they knew of a parking ramp that wasnt quite so much money  per night is very pricey even for Chicago and was told there wasnt any  When the bellboy was helping unload the luggage he told my husband there was a parking ramp   blocks away for  per night the ramp next to CVS on Kinzie First we were sent to a room on the th floor that was a king size bed and there were  of us and I had confirmed the day before that we would have a nonsmoking  double bed room  After I contacted the front desk we got switched to a room with  double beds on the th floor that I was certain the minute I walked in was a smoking room but felt after looking around and not noting any ashtrays that be I was mistaken  We also had a room with a door that connected to another room which usually is never an issue but for some reason this hotel or be it was this door was paper thin and you could hear the family next door just having casual conversation a hairdryer being used the tv show they were watching and Im sure they were just as impressed with our children settling in to a new environment  We did not stay in the room for long I truly could not stand the smell and did note that the hotel was smoke free throughout but that must be a recent thing     the first room did not smell that they took us too but the second one was saturated in that stale smoke smell  There is no pool at this hotel the hairdryer I could not locate until the end of my stay because they keep it in the closet in the room and not in the bathroom where one might expect to find it  The room or was not my taste at all a bit tacky with the shadow of a chandelier on the wallpapered walls and vinyl throw pillows on the bed along with that vinyl like bucket style chair at the desk with some odd s like handle in the middle of the back  The wall to floor windows are nice but made me very nervous when my young child figured out that the smaller panes opened up and there is no screening and you on on the th floor  The plasma big screen is nice and the bathroom I thought was one of the better features   it was roomy and not tacky and seemed very clean  The staff was for the most part friendly   although since my husband was leaving to park the car and the bellman that was taking out our luggage and placing it on the cart was assumed to be the person to take the luggage upstairs my husband tipped the guy since he wouldnt be up there     the bellman walked us in to the lobby acted like he was going to be right behind us by telling us to go up in the first elevator and that he would be in the next and to our surprise a new bellman showed up with the luggage       hope the second guy figured out that his tip was sitting in the hands of his buddy that passed us off before completing the task  The only other off experience was the man who was staffing the microsoft room which my husband and kids enjoyed the xbox s who was quotarrogantquot and very rude according to my husband     seems other guest were getting the same impression of him from the comments my husband was hearing while in the room  People who have commented on the dark hallways and elevators are right on     and some of the artwork on the elevator walls is a bit creepy     a women holding a skull I admit we are not Blues fans and be that is what you need to be into to really appreciate the ElviraAdams Family or  The location was different and I did appreciate being at the South end of the Michigan Ave area after coming from the North end   It was fairly close to Millenium Park  The house of blues is literally right outside the hotel door but we did not go to but there was plenty of activity that involved several police cars the night we were there  So after being at that  star hotel that was clean fresh with  pools right off N  Michigan Avenue for less money we were very disappointed with what a  star offers   if this had been a  star I would have gotten exactly what I would have expected and would have felt treated to the bellboys being on staff  
P => So cool I almost felt hip myself The Hotel Sax is so incredibly cool I almost felt hip myself Our group consisted of  moms taking teenagers to Chicago and camp  We all had our mouths hanging open for the first hour from checking in to discovering our rooms and the th floor quotgame roomquot  This place was a huge very pleasant surprise considering we got it on Hotwire at the last minute  A Monday night stay must be the key because the hotel was   booked the following night  The lobby is small but really unique using old store display counters filled with antique cut glass items as their check in desk  A big jar of cinnamon jelly beans was a hit  The or here and in the rooms is just plain out of this world It looks like some really hip design team had a great concept that they carried out to the finest detail The staff at every point was fantastic  We got great advice from the concierge the valets were very funny and personable the front desk was warm and friendly and I even ran into the general manager on the elevator and he was so nice  An extremely hip place like this tends to have really stuck up staff think The Delano in South Beach Miami but these people were typical Midwesterners   nice funny unassuming We had two double beds in our room and the sheets and pillows were luxurious  The shower head is enormous and blasted water which we liked  The bar in The Hotel Sax has got to be seen even if you dont stop in for a drink  It has arate nooks with huge couches and chairs  It looked like THE place to meet up if youre a Chicago yuppy We had a late dinner at Smith and Wallenskys literally a stones throw across the driveway  The view of the river on a beautiful warm summers night was great  Hopefully the Hotel Sax will keep up the great work and we look forward to visiting it again and recommending it to everyone 
P => Very posh for one night business trip I went on a  night business trip to Chicago and my hotel was booked for me  I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel  Once checked in I was given a king size room on the th floor  The view is awesome and I loved the quot plasma flat screen tv  The bathroom had plenty of towels and tolietries for one night  There was a small mini fridge and liquors on the dresser  nice touch but pricey   for an oj Our group met back down at the Crimson Lounge  I liked the music atmosphere but a lady came around wanting us to purchase the table for the night  Umm    they were not that busy or that good  The bar was just as good  The hotel is in an area with lots of night life and is a quick taxi ride to anywhere in the downtown area  House of Blues was next door and we didnt have to pay a cover since we checked it out near closing time awesome blues  I had a newspaper at my door early the next morning before am  Check out was a breeze and a billowy white curtains in the entrance was a nice touch  
P => Loved almost everything My two girlfriends and I booked a room at the Sax over Memorial Day weekend  We got a good deal  We picked this hotel based on TripAdvisors suggestion that its good for singles  They were rightThe Sax is definitely a hotel for people willing to stay somewhere a little different  The lobby isnt very big but there are comfy chairs and couches to wait on  The doormen were extremely friendly  The front desk staff were friendly as well although some of them were a bit hit and miss  The Crimson Lounge is definitely a pro for this hotel  The lounge seems very new and is orated in red and black  The drinks are a bit pricey but the bartenders were extremely sweet and made sure we got fantastic drinks for our dollars  Only downside was that the lounge closed around am but this is the same as most places in Chicago  The room was great  Luxurious comfy beds huge bathroom the wireless internet worked flawlessly and it was spotless every day  The big downside   the concierge  They had a few different people staffing the concierge desk and we only had one competant one   that was Christina or Catherine  She was fantastic but the others didnt really know anything  They had to make several phone calls to find anything out and they didnt even know the way to get placesSo overall Id stay here again knowing that I might have to do my own investigating for where to go and what to do and how to get there  Otherwise had an excellent stay 
P => Very different We booked our stay at The Hotel Sax Chicago with Hotels com we got a very good deal and last minute too On arrival we were very impressed with the lobby area all be it small it was bright and airy with crystal and glass in cabinets all around  The doormen were very attentive too  It was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared  The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark once up to the th floor we were met with a very dark slightly creepy in a nice way corridor  This hotel must have just been reated because everything was immaculate Our room was a surprise it was quite big and even though the or was a little busy we did like it the bathroom was large with good qaulity fixtures  The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday  The soaps they use a lovely too and WOW what a great shower  The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows  The bed was super king size and the bed was very comfortable  As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow top and it was like a big shmellow All the fixtures and fittings looked to be brand new  Be warned though as some of the mini bar items water ect snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free  We did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced  We ate at Bin for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed There is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge gosh this place looked like a Vampires Lure very gothic red and so dark you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables  It was very busy on the weekend we where there with lots of young girls aged around     dressed to impress not our cup of tea really We did like Chicago not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights  Harry Carays is a nice Bar ect  We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off  ALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the ina right next to the House Of Blues were you can watch blues and eat good food we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir was fantastic and en experience  Our only gripe was our view out of the windows of the Corn Cob Towers the car park hosts the first  floors so being on floor  we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise  However all in all it was a great hotel and well worth the money  
P => Ill stay somewhere else next time First off let me say the bed quot plasma TV and staff service were all great  The room was always clean and was well stocked with plenty of typically high priced snacks and enough alcohol to drop an elephant Now that that is out of the way on to the other issues   No internet    the  wired jacks didnt work and the wireless wouldnt hold a connection for more than  seconds  I was according to the hotel technician that came to check my internet in one of the best rooms for wireless by the elevators  In the end I could do no work from the hotel room Although supposedly being freshly reated the bottom row of tiles in the tubshower were soft and sagging from water rot of the wall behind No bar of soap or bath mat until day  The probably once comfortable arm chair in the room has been recovered in    I kid you not    imitation vinyl TEXTURED snake skin  Not only does it look horrid the chair is now cold uncomfortable and squeaks when you sit in it  I used it once for about  seconds No screens on the windows  To the delight of the fly that joined me in my room on day  No vending machines in the entire hotel  None zippo  The guest book says there are but the hotel operator informed me that there arent after I went looking  I refused to open the  bottle of water in my room and wandered off to a grocery store instead And lastly who puts a pedestal sink in a hotel room There is no counter space to put down all the toiletries you typically travel with and I ended up using the toilet tank as a shelf As much as I loved the bed and TV I personally wouldnt stay there again  If youre just looking for a quiet place to crash though you might consider it  
P => Perfect ior Suite was perfect for me and my  teenage dhters King bed with wall mounted flat screen and living room area with a sleeper sofa with its own wall mounted flat screen  If bed privacy is an issue this arrangement would not work because all that erates the  sleeping areas is a sheer chiffon curtain  Bath area is gigantic with floor to ceiling windows  sinks large amt of counter space  Housekeeping was very attentive  Evening concierge io   helped out with printing airline boarding passes at a certain time even though we werent even at the hotel at the time they needed to printed  He was very accomodating Hotel is as close to everything as you need to be  Big city so you cant be walking distance to everything but definitely is in the middle of all  House of Blues is right across the driveway from the hotel and we enjoyed the Sunday afternoon Gospel Brunch      buffet style    so by the time you make it back to your table food is cold but that happens at every buffet  Should have more that  guys preparing omelettes  Would stay there again for sure Adult atmosphere   wouldnt be a place I would stay with young kids  Nothing is geared for youngsters  GOOD 
P => Absolutely Fantastic My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Sax and we loved it We were attending the House of Blues excellent location just out the door and we were there  The staff was friendly and did everything to make sure our stay was a great one Conceirge was able to get us reservations in the Foundation Room at the HOB what a place Doorman was the absolute best It is our new home in Chicago T 
P => Trendy upscale hotel What a great hotel The bed area of the rooms are on the small side but the bathrooms are absolutely huge What beautiful or  There was jazz music playing in our room when we first got there which was a nice touch  The bed was so comfortable and there is a huge flat screen tv mounted on the wall  The location was perfect  Walking distance to almost everything in downtown Chicago shopping theatre district Millennium Park etc  Although we did not go there the Crimson Lounge in the lobby looked like a great place for drinks and dancing  We had a great romantic weekend at the Hotel Sax  
P => Adored this hotel We stayed at the Hotel Sax this past weekend for my birthday and LOVED it The staff were so friendly helpful and courteous  The location was amazing right next to the House of Blues and  block from all kinds of restaurants and bars  The concierge service was AMAZING He was helpful answered our questions thoroughly and even gave us passes to get into Howl at the Moon  I was also very surprised by a birthday treat sent up to my room  The or is really quite beautiful and the choices of places to eat drink and even bowl were great We actually came back to the hotel after dinner and some time out and spent time in both the Crimson Lounge and  Pin the wacky bowling alley 
P => It was exactly what we needed Booked at the Hotel Sax through TravelZoo  We ided to go for a V day weekend  Got their around pm on Friday and there was no wait at check in  Gave us a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe king and a free bottle of wine  We were taken to the th floor to a glorious room  The room was huge with a king bed big windows a quot tv mini bar and desk  The bathroom was huge and orated really nice  Be careful of the mini bar with its electronic sensors that automatically charge you after what they say is  seconds  I would go with closer to   We had  charges on there that they happily took off  If you head to the th floor you will find THE STUDIO which was put together by Microsoft  In this room you would XBOX with Rock Band Halo Madden and many others  All of this was surrounded by couches and was never crowded I skipped the valet parking at a rate of  i believe  I instead parked in a parking ramp one block away for  for the entire weekend  It took less than  minutes to walk there and drive back Overall a great weekend PS   Try Brazazz for dinner while you are there  Its  blocks up Dearborn and the food is amazing  Brazazz is a Brazilian steakhouse  
P => trendy but very dark This hotel is trying too hard  The lobby is nice and the lounge bar is very cool  However the rooms are so dark that it is hard to see anything  Only one side of the bed has a dim lamp  There is a very small lamp on the desk and a very dark floor lamp  If you plan to read or work in your room this is not the hotel for you  
P => A swanky night at the Hotel Sax My boyfriend and I live in Chicago and wanted to book a night downtown to celebrate our rd anniversary  After browsing Hotwire I came across the Hotel Sax which used to be the House of Blues Hotel I am an Interior Designer and I was pretty blown away by the sophistication and style of the hotels interior  It felt like something out of New York City  Not only were the rooms incredibly hip and clean with good ammenities but the bar downstairs in the Lobby Crimson was very swank  I thought it was definitely a step up from the tired old bars at both of the W Hotels in Chicago  On top of all this you cant beat the location  Its right between the Loop and River North so you get choose your adventures from there and you are literally at the door step of the House of Blues  Pin Bowling and Bin  a wonderful restaurant  Overall we had a great time and got it for a steal   a night and I would recommend this to anyone 
P => Really nice surprise Very happy with Hotel Sax  Nice or friendly staff and a bed that you can just sink in to  It has an all around good feeling in the hotel  Impressed with the low price due to its great location  We will check out this hotel again when we take another weekend trip from the suburbs to downtown Chicago  
P => perfect weekend trip My family is from the Chicago suburbs and we ided to stay here for  nights so we could enjoy our own city  Chicago The hotel met all our expectations  The game room on the th floor was an excellent place for my  children to busy themselves as I would get ready for a night out  The location is perfect  We went to the Chicago theatre walked Shopped in the loop and Mich Ave  Drove to the Zoo and Navy Pier and ate at an excellent new restaurant right next to our hotel called A Mano Yes  it seemed to cater to a younger hip group  Huge crowd on Saturday Night for the club near the lobby  Great people watching There is no pool however if your kids care about swimming  We were mainly looking for a ent rate in a great location  I think we found it at the Hotel SaxThanks  Hope this helps  
P => Fabulous Hotel Sax My husband and I stayed at hotel Sax for the weekend of ember th   We were both utterly impressed with the entire experience the hotel location the room the staff and the dining  You cannot ask for a better combination The staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially the concierge  If you re in Chicago and would like to stay where all the action is then Hotel Sax is the place 
P => Nice central location  Interesting or  This ultra modern hotel was very comfortable and well equipped for our stay  My husband two children and I stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend  The location was great for walking to the shopping area along the one mag  mile  The hotel restaurant  Bin was great for a full breakfast with very attentive staff and excellent food  We went outside of the hotel for dinner  The hotel staff was polite and very willing to assist with easy check in and front door chivalry  I found the lighting in the hallways a bit on the dim side but chalked it up to the overall style the designers were trying to achieve  The room was modern and funky in style but large spacious clean and more than equipped for an extremely comfortable stay  I would stay here again while in Chicago  
P => Hotel Sax Needs to Turn on the LIghts When the House of Blues underwent reation and became the Hotel Sax elongate that quotaquot when speaking to your children we were intrigued by the relatively reasonable rate and the chance to see the refurbishment  We saw what we could given that quotmood lightingquot pervades the hallways and the rooms themselves  From the stark white of the lobby where twenty somethings with asymetrical haircuts waited companionably with chubby middle aged midwesterners we ascended to a dim hallway where we used our car key flashlight to insert the key in the lock  Nearby prints of Old Masters hung benignly in curly red laquered frames If you have ever seen the movie quotBeetlejuicequot you will have some sense of the post modern frou frou that defines the or  The key feature of our smallish but adequate king room was a large wing chair upholstered in snakeskin vinyl  Next to it was a midnight blue floor lamp with matching shade  Ah Light we thought but how much light does a nearly black lamp give you The paisleyed wallpaper included a startling flat gray silouette of a chandelier  Oh that it were light emitting  Bedside lighting next to the black padded headboard finally proved adequate and the bathroom was large and clean although without an adequate surface on which to park a cosmetics bag  The king bed was comfortable and the flat screen TV worked fine  One look see into the bar on the first floor left us shuddering at the updated cathouse or    enough red velvet to sink a ship  Edgy yes but it is all going to look merely dim and dated in a couple of years  Were still glad we went and as others have commented the location is great for restaurants  
P => Modern Hotel Good hotel  Sheets and towels were high quality  Room was clean  Staff was friendly  The kids liked the game room on floor    The hotel is in a great location  The orating was modern which was fine for me  Others might have a problem with it  Would go back 
P => Great style I stayed here when it was the House of Blues Hotel so was very interested to see what had changed  The room I had was fantastic  Not especially large rooms but large enough and very stylish with a large flat screen  This hotel is certainly a departure from the normal beige The hotel is very handy for most locations waterfront Magnificent Mile and Rush and Division etc  Breakfast was very good although Bin  is not the best for atmosphere The price I paid was  night so not cheap but a good hotel for the rate  
P => Yes to Hotel Sax We stayed at the Hotel Sax last minute because our original hotel was overbooked  The staff at the hotel took care of some very disgruntled people and put us at ease right away  The bowling alley adjacent to the hotel is lots of fun and the finger foods are tasty  The bar downstairs is really nice and a cool place to just relax  The room itself posed a few issues that the hotel was a little slow in attending to but considering everything else it was very minor and didnt really change our attitude towards the overall experience  
P => Style over Substance     But Great Modern Style Recently remodeled property  The rooms were very clean but sparse  Cute or  Great lobby and hotel bar in the heart of downtown Chicago  Love BIN the restaurant and wine bar thats connected to the property  
P => Best Nights Sleep Ever in a Hotel Great location on the south end of the loop  No problem walking the Mile for shopping plus it was a block from the theatre district where we cht a show  Surrounded by fabulous restaurants and fun pubs  Beside the locale the hotel staff was so helpful with both shopping and dining tips  The room was the best part  I had the best nights sleep ever in a hotel  First the bed and pillows were heavenly  The blackout curtains allowed us to sleep in after a fun night out on the town and the rooms were so quiet that I didnt hear any hallway or neighbor noises  We used the Airport Shuttle express service to and from the hotel for ease  Definitely would stay here again  
P => Hotel  Slax  We had stayed at the House of Blues in the past and were anxious to see what The Hotel Sax had done in its makeover  The HOB was funky and the Hotel Sax remains funky but the or is cheap and uncomfortable and seems to have been done on a shoe string budget  The dark hallways with faux candlesticks and tacky wallpaper have a Disneys Haunted House feel to them  The rooms themselves seemed like the product of a rushed quotTrading Spacesquot or quotWhile You Were Outquot show in which massive changes were made in a short amount of time for a small amount of money  Gaudy or aside the bellman and valet while friendly were inappropriately casual quotThanks manquot and quotThanks dudequot were some of their responses to us and the cleaning staff missed broken glass in front of our room from a dropped tray of a neighboring room  Our room while large it was a suite bordered the elevators and the noise from their movement was nonstop  The lobby is full of cases of crystal stemware  While unusual it lends itself to the crystal department at a retail store and its purpose is unclear  What is the point of all that glassChicago has so many beautiful hotels I would suggest you stay someplace else  
P => Swank Hotel Sax Beautiful swank hotel with very friendly staff  Convenient location   walking distance to Museum Mile shopping Millenium Park etc  Mini bar amp room service are reasonably priced  Crunch gym location is in the basement  Theres also a great wine shop next door   be sure to visit it Valet parking is overpriced   there are much less expensive parking options at street level  I was substantially overbilled amp had a minor heart attack but the staff personnel quickly resolved it  I did not visit the House of Blues though I had initially intended to  
P => Hotel Sax a great experience and location The Hotel Sax is in one of the best locations in Chicago  It is a half block from the Chicago River and many rooms have partial river views mine did  It is just a couple blocks from the Magnificent Mile a couple blocks from the Merchandise t and is surrounded by many of the best restaurants in the city  You can walk to most of the places youd want to visit  The recently reated hotel has modern and luxurious furnishings and my room was huge and very comfortable  Great bed large bath a huge plasma TV and windows that actually opened to let in fresh air  Internet in the room was free as was wifi in the lobby  I loved the fact that on each floor by the elevators there was a TV in the wall to watch while waiting for the elevator  The lobby was lovely including the reception desks which were fronted by glass cabinetry filled with beautiful crystal pieces  The front desk personnel were friendly and efficient and the concierge was most helpful  Same for the bellmen  My only staff hitch was the reservations agent I spoke with on the phone who was not friendly or very helpful  When I complained about her in the survey I received after leaving the hotel the manager was very prompt in writing to apologize about that and promised to remedy the situation  The lobby bar The Crimson Bar is just that    red red red  It is huge and orated like a luxury bordello  There are many private and comfortable seating areas with sofas large chairs etc  Also a long bar and friendly bartenders  It is not a restaurant but they do have a bar menu  We tried the restaurant off the lobby called Bin  and were rather disappointed with it  It was loud crowded and not comfortable  Our food was not cooked as requested and the efficient but not gracious waitress said thats just how they do it then reluctantly offered to take it back  I noted in my hotel survey that since there are dozens of great restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel including several within two blocks that I would have no reason to return to Bin   Again the manager was apologetic and promised to make it better  Overall I loved this hotel and highly recommend it  Everything within the hotel itself is very well done beautiful and comfortable and the amenities are excellent  The location is ideal  And I got a very good rate for my stay  I will definitely stay there again  
P => Great location and stylish or We stayed here because we got a great promotional rate online otherwise dont know if we could have afforded it  The lobby and rooms are so stylish and luxurious as is the lounge and winebar next door  The staff are all very helpful and friendly  Its easy to get around just step outside and youre on the river and nearby the El  My only complaint is the parking which is obscene at  a day 
P => You Are Kidding Right I have stayed at this hotel many times when it was House of Blues Loews  Lets just say the new company did not hit the k with the redo  The only thing that I think is better is the Flat panel tvs in the rooms  The or is awful and cheap looking be they got a great deal at Ikea  The lobby is all white and very cold feeling  im sure it will feel even colder in the winter  The new lounge is not good at all  A paparazzi wall  I know I felt like a star while I was sitting in front of it  LOL The lounge staff has zero personality I think I bothered them by ordering a drink  The only staff that i remembered from times past were Rico and Wayne  Doorman and Catherine concierge All three remembered me and are the ONLY brite spot in my stay  I dont think I will be staying here again P S  If anyone knows where the staff from the old  Kazbar  lounge is at please let me know  They were the best  That really hurt this place when they left  
P => Second stay loved it This is my second stay at this hotel and it again was great The only bad thing was we asked for quotturn downquot service and they came at  PM to do it We were already asleep Had kids what can I say So they came the next night earlier and quotturned downquot the beds BUT no treats We were expecting a little something from the other reviews but nothing No mint or jellybean So the kids thought this turn down service was stupid Had to agree with them Anyway the hotel was nice and remodeled and clean  We even asked for a micro wave and they brought us one right away  The only drawback is parking  It was  a day and the lot right across the street was  a day  Wish I would have used that one and spent  instead of    but they come and snatch up your car right away and you think that is the thing to do  Our car never left the lot for  days so it really could have been parked across the street  Our rooms were nice and clean and large  It really is a fun stay for right downtown  You can walk to Michigan Ave  very easily  I enjoyed it and the kids thought we were quothigh classquot They even had robes for us to wear that was fun 
P => Great location interesting place My friend and I stayed here for one night  We chose this hotel because its next to the House of Blues and were lazy  It was a perfect location for HOB and wandering Michigan Ave Navy Pier etc  I was thrown off by the lobby  I wasnt sure I was in a hotel  All of the staff we encountered including the front desk housekeeping and valets were exceptionally pleasant and helpful  We were able to check in early which is always nice  I had expected only to store our bags for the day  The room was unusually orated with a fake snakeskin wing chair jewel toned upholstery and an LCD panel tv  The only complaint is the weak in room lighting  The shower head was as big as a dinner plate and it was like taking a shower in a heavy rains but in a good way  Would I stay here again Yes but its not exactly a thrifty option  
P => Unique hotel in a great location I stayed at the Hotel Sax for a convention that was in town and really enjoyed my stay  I do not know what the hotel looked like before but they really did a great job Almost felt like I was in a W hotel The guest room I stayed in was huge and comfortable great amenities too  Very helpful employees great ambiance great location  The only thing that I was dissapointed in was the food that came out of the room service department  I ordered breakfast and paid over  for a mini box of cereal small pot of coffee and a banana that was so bruised I just threw it out  Other than that I hope to stay again when I am in town for business  
P => Exciting and very cool Hotel Sax Stayed nine enjoyable nights at the Hotel Sax  House of Blues is centered there  Hotel has been completely reated and the new ornate and ultra modern BarLounge next to the front desk is something to see and enjoy Very unique Hotel is close to everything downtown and World famous Michigan Avenue Shopping is also within walking distance  Restaurants steakhouses Harry Carrys MortonsSullivansetc are within walking distance  Great Full Service Gym connected to Hotel  Staff was very friendly  Concierge set up a private room at the Smith and Wollensky sp steakhouse on the property  Hotel gives you a feeling that you are staying at an exciting unique and very modern hotel near everything in Chicago 
P => Great Hotel and Location I was here on businesspleasure and it was a fantastic stay As they told me prior to booking the lobby was finished being reatedit smelled great  So I had no problems with that  ALL the staff was very gracious and kind to me and my friends  The lounge downstairs is an excellent modern place to relax and have a good time I stayed in a cabin room which is smaller but fit just me perfectly  I would only stay in that room with one other person and it would be someone I am comfortable with  Not a room for someone who wants privacy with a roommate  Location is great  Short walk to shops at Michigan Ave  I also walked to Navy Pier  It is not a quick walk  minsbut it is defiantly a nice walk if you want to see the sights and take your time getting there House of Blues bowling alley lounge and jazz clubs etc   I plan on staying there again Found a good rate on orbitz via kayak com  
P => Enjoyable Stay I stayed here with  other women for a bachelorette party  The rooms were average although the bathrooms were big and the flat screen televisions were fun the room was not as special as the high price  We did find the hotel staff VERY helpful kind and friendly  The location is pretty good perfect if youre going to an event at House of Blues  I probably would not stay here again without a deep deep discount  
P => fab plus i cant say anything bad about the hotel  The staff were fabulous our room was upgraded to a suite  We did see the standard rooms and they were a good size  The room service menu is not expensive considering you are in the heart of Chicago  It is a truly a great hotel with good pricing since there was a reation so book now before they raise the prices  
P => swank not really bank The best part of the hotel was the staff  They were very nice informative and friendly  I really wish that there was more to say that was good  The room service was practically robbery with the limited menu and outrageous price for what you actually getnot to mention that they didnt have the item that I wanted and had to settle for something else  There is no phone book in your room so you can do one of two things   Call the concierge and get the number for a charge of which they dont tell you or  Get the internet services in your room turned on for   only to find out that they stay connected until  p m  Went to get ice and the machine didnt work on my floor so I went one floor down and that one wasnt working either The bar was charging  for chapagne which I noticed the same brand in a liquor store for probably  dollars less  Location was great and the room was nice but some of the things that you expect from a regular hotel was missing in this posh place  I just think overall fundamentally it should have been better  
P => BEST OF CHICAGO This hotel is fabulous Regular rooms are on the small side but the suites are just wonderful  My husband and I celebrated an anniversary at the HOB     We had a great time Kaz bar had great drinks and superb service  Dont recommend for families wsmall children  
P => Not nearly ready for prime time  Avoid it  The House of Blues Hotel has been undergoing changes for the last five months  It is now called HOTEL SAX yes thats as in saxophone or is it just a play on your eye This place has problems the front desk is currently on the fourth floor of this  story  room building  Getting there can be a pain  Theres ONLY ONE working elevator in the whole place One elevator for  rooms Management ided to keep the place open while reating everything  What a disaster that makes Stairways lead to construction zones that are roped off from the public  Dust everywhere  Movie channels are not working  The newly reated rooms are still relatively clausterphobic but far more tasteful than the House of Blues quotstylequot or lack thereof  Still someone failed to do their homework  The tiny desk chair sweats against your back something terrible No wireless Internet  Wait a while and be theyll be ready for primetime  Meanwhile think of  clowns in a VW Beetle and youll know what the pain is here  
P => Good hotel   under construction We had a great stay here and chose the hotel because of concert plans at the HOB  Room was nice a little sparse with the amenities but comfortable and beautiful large windows looking out on Chicago  The hotel lives up to its rock and roll image   dark halls do not disturb signs aplenty and considerate housekeeping that doesnt bang around the halls in the mornings  I imagine it can get very loud late night although we had NO issues with noise but be warned  The hotel is under new management will soon be a Lowes I believe and so there was no lobby to speak of  That was a bit of a bummer since we couldnt hang out at the hotel bar before and after the show  Im curious to see how it changes under new management  
P => Very unique hotel nice location I stayed at this hotel in e  when visitng family in Chicago  I found the hotel to be very unique indeed with nice works of art in every room and all around the hotel The hotel is located on the Chicago River and many of the rooms offer spectacular views of the city  It is located very closely to the Chicago River and the river tours The only complaints I have with the room are as follows the room keys often got deactivated everyday so we had to call the front desk every evening upon returning or the room  Also the hotel as of e of last year did not offer complementary internet access  
P => Great location Wait until the remodel is finished and this will be a great place to stay in Chicago  Bin  is good for breakfast although a little cold  Liked the room deluxe king As with most city hotels its not an amazing experience to stay there   it you want that you need to find a town house with  rooms but then you lose out on location and facilities so pay your money and take your choice My only recommendation for Chicago in general is coffee at Uncommon Ground but its not in the centre 
P => Not so great They really should tell you that they are in the midst of a remodel  Kind of a mess and noisy  Worst part was the Gospel Brunch  huge ripoff  Mediocre food crammed in like sardines and the quottalentquot was worse than American Idol rejects  I would opt for the Hard Rock next time  
P => Amazing This place was incredible We booked a room with Travel Planners and told them jokingly to give us a great room because we had never been to Chicago and we were in shock when we were taken to our room Following the bellhop past all of the single doors on the th floor to the end of the hall we came to a set of double doors  When he opened the doors to this massive suite we thought there had to be a HUGE mistake as we were only paying  per night It had a huge living and dining room a bar  huge half bath and  unbelievably huge full bath with a shower large enough for  and a giant tub with a tv built in the wall The bedroom was incredible with  oversized chairs and an ottaman an armoire with web tv nintendo and a large tv  There were windows down each side of the room lots of them that overlooked downtown The maids put jelly bellys on your pillow at turndown and theres a big vase full of jelly bellys  Its orated with what looks like way cool pier  furnishings  Just unreal We were there for  days and I long to go back but I am sure that suite is well over  per night  It was the best and such a fun unique place 
P => Loved It Stayed there for a quotgirls night outquot weekend  Loved every minute of it They are remodeling and we got a new remodeled room  It was fabulous Well worth every penny  The staff was excellent the food and bar where great It was easy to get too off the highway  Cant say anything bad about the hotel  
P => Fabulous with easy access to HOB concert I stayed at the HOB hotel with fans of a group playing at the HOB venue  I was very pleased with the accommodations  The color scheme in the room was funky and pleasing  The bathroom was fabulous Everything about the place was eye candy  Beds were very comfortable Id stay there again in a heartbeatFor anyone with mobility impairment   everything about this facility was access friendly  
P => Great hotel but major construction going on      I attended an exhibition in Chicago last week and had booked the House of Blues hotel last year as we were attending an evening function at the House of Blues venue located next door to the hotel Upon arrival We were shocked to see that the main entrance is shut and that you have to go through a side door and we were then ushered into an elevator onto the th floor where they have made a makeshift reception area I had travelled all the way from the UK and was in need of a good old fashioned beer    only to be told that there was no hotel bar available I was gobsmacked     I made a small protest and was told that the reation work did not affect my hotel room  This did not humour me after  hours travellingAfter all this the rooms were very clean and well laid out  The bed was very comfortable and the staff did a great job considering their surroundings All in all I was a little disappointed that we werent told in advance about the restoration but hey thats lifeAlso the House of blues venue located next door has a bar and is a good place to see some local bands perform for free providing you show the doormen your key 
P => What happened Where to start The hotel was the best in the city rooms bar and staff but they are going through a MAJOR overhaul right now  That place is gutted down to concrete theyve let go all of the great staff and I hear they are trying to make it into yet another W clone  I recognized a doorman and one concierge on my last stay   and Ive been there at least twice a year since the place opened  The reason I stayed there instead of the Ritz   the staff  The doormen and front desk staff greeted me by name and I never had to wait a minute at the bar before my favorite drink was already in my hand  Even if this place looks ok when all of the reations are over   without their staff theyve lost my business  I shouldve know when it stopped being a Loews that it was all going downhill fast  
P => Very comfortable stay Weve stayed at the House of Blues several times it is a very comfortable hotel especially the bedding  The colors in the room are a bit loud but considering its a blues hotel its appropriate  The TVs are out of date in some rooms but there is a VCR and a nice stereo for use  The room service was good  for breakfast we split a meal only complaint is that there is no coffee pot in the room you must order room service or walk downstairs to Bin  for coffee to go Bathroom is fine no curved shower curtain rod but clean and lots of shampoo conditioner etc  provided  Had a beautiful view of the Ford Towers and the canal  
P => HOB Lobby Bar has comfy chairs music   perfect    Actually I have not stayed at the House of Blues Hotel but I visit the lobby bar every time I am in Chicago     what a nice environment  Comfy chairs and couches in a Mediteranean or with some great live music most nights    I have introduced several friends for after work and late night drinks and they love it also  Dont miss it if you are tired of loud music and metal or wood chairs     The seating is great for close conversation without having to talk across a table    Nick 
P => This hotel gave me the blues The hotel is well located but is generally dark with a lack of amenities for guests  When there is a function the public bar gets very crowded Most of the staff were fine but not the receptionist  We pointed out there were incorrect charges on the bill which rather than apologise for she agued the case  eg a parking charge when we had no car At our latest trip to Chicago we stayed at the Renaisance which was worth the extra cost  
P => House of Blues was great Stayed at the House of Blues while in town for the Rolling Stones concert  It was a great experience  The hotel was very cool  We loved the or and the great vibe we got the moment we walked into the lobby  The staff was very courteous and very helpful  There is some loud construction going on next the hotel but fortunately our room was on the north side of the hotel and the construction is taking place on the south side  The only negative thing about our stay was the ice machine on our floor did not work  Not a big deal at all  We will definitely stay there again  
P => good price lovely room would recommend We stopped at this hotel on the th and th of tember wed never been to chicago so wanted a hotel fairly central its over looks the river and is a   minute walk to the magnificent mile  The room was large and clean and the or as described on the hotel web site  The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful  When looking for a hotel we didnt want to pay a fortune but wanted a   or above hotel we found that hotels in Chicago tended to be on the expensive side compared to other cities Las vegas New York San fransisco We paid   a night taking into account the other hotels we looked at we feel we had value for money and would recommend this hotel to others  
P => Never again I was very disappointed in my stay here  Staff at the front desk was rude  When I called down for towels it took them  minutes to bring them up  The hotel is beautiful but that doesnt make up for the poor service 
P => Good hotel good location I love this hotel and we stay here often  However since this is no longer owned by Loews Hotels it is starting to show signs of wear and some of the amenities are not as plush as the Loews Hotels group The staff is very accommodating and pleasant  The overall vibe of the hotel radiates cool  It is dark and exotic  The regular rooms are small the colors are loud but it all seems to work and very comfortable The hotel and rooms are spotless and odor free  The bedding is fabulous  The sheets are soft with a feather bed comforter  But as I said earlier starting to show signs of wear  The courtesy items in the bathroom are a nice touch unexpected good quality and they also supply q tips and cotton swabs left over from the Loews group  The bathrooms are big  Almost as big as the room The mini bar is packed with everything imaginable but on the pricey side  Room service is hit or miss on quality of food and expensive  It works if you are hungry and dont want to go out The river north location is perfect  A short walk to State Street North Michigan Avenue theater district and excellent restaurants  Forget Smith and Wollensky not worth the high prices The Kazbar serves up yummy cocktails and bar food  This is a great place to watch for famous people and musicians who  be appearing at the House of Blues concert hall next door  If you arent a member of House of Blues Foundation room you should be  The Foundation room private dining room menu and food is GREAT in Chicago I highly recommend this hotel  One last thing beware of construction going on at the hotel  They are giving it a face lift  Lets hope the rooms are next before it goes down hill      
P => BEWARE CONSTRUCTION We checked into the hotel around pm after being on the rode for  hrs  The front desk was easy to deal with beautiful lobby  The bellman was great  We had a suite which was   a night  The room was nice could use a little updating but clean  We then ordered room service which was very good for being so late  Then it was off to bed the beds were very comfortable there was a cigarrette hole in the comforter but other then that the linens were clean and the pilows were nice  It seemed we would have a great sleep for are next day  hr  drive  WRONG We were woken up around am by the sound of Jackhammers Not one but many  They are working on a garage across the street and the noise is loud We could not fall asleep We did call down to complain and they did make it up to us  But It still did not help that we had such a long drive ahead  If you are going to book a room here be sure you call first and ask if there is still construction going on across the street 
P => A plus for or and fun C minus for service We stayed at House of Blues in  The Hotel is fun  The or is Vegas light the location is spectacular and the rooms are big bright and fun The service was very mediocre for a Hotel in this price range  We arrived at  in the afternoon and our room was not ready for nearly  more hours  We werent the only guests in this bind the lobby was littered with clusters of folks waiting for their keys The cab line out front was more chaotic than it should have been  
P => Good Location Get a good deal though I just stayed here with another couple for a long weekend from y    We arrived early and the hotel was able to accommodate all of us in two rooms  The place is really funky with a lot of Ca artwork and funky colors  We got a great flighthotel deal on Orbitz because otherwise I would have been mad if I had paid full price  I paid on average night LOCATIONThis hotel is in a GREAT location  It is within walking distance to the Navy Pier  min Mag Mile  blocks and Pizziera Uno the original restaurant to do Chicago style pizza    blocks  It is also only about    blocks walk to the Red Line of the El which is one of the main lines to take you to Wrigley Field the Chicago Art Museum Millennium Park and more  Also within this hotel there is a fancy restaurant attached Bin  open for B L and D and an upscale bowling alleytini bar called  pin  There s also the House of Blues for which the hotel is named  This hotel is in the middle of a bunch of other hotels including the new Trump Hotel which is being constructed so there is no view of anything except other hotels and parking ramps  Don t stay here for the view  Stay here for the location ROOMSThe windows actually open which meant that come outside noise could be heard  However once we closed the heavy curtains it was both dark and extremely quiet  The internal walls are thick and we didn t hear a peep from the party going on across the hallway from us phew  The rooms are small however  We had an extremely small room  It was only enough to fit a bed  The television had to be placed on the side desk against the window instead of straight on so don t plan on watching tv in bedCRUNCHThere is a Crunch health club attached to the hotel  However you have to pay  per day to use the facilities  There was only ever   people there every time I looked so they should really open it up to all guests HANDY TIPS There is a hairdryer in every room but it is in the closet so look for it there  Call for turn down service every night for a fun treat Bin  has a coffee bar for a quick java or a muffin  It s nice when you don t have the time or money for a full breakfast Want coffee in your room Call the front desk  They ll bring you a coffee maker and coffee free of charge  The th floor of the hotel has a business center for all guests that has a table wfour chairs and internet service  There was never anyone there as far as I can tell and we played board games there All in all this hotel was not that memorable but the location was great and I got a good deal so it was worth it  
P => Pricey but thats Chicago The hotel is located within a short walk of the river the Magnificent Mile and a train stop  Like any other big city hotel the House of Blues is a bit steep  A happy hour for two people ran    probably  more than expected  Hotel is unique and the workout area is an independent gym  per day but it is a full size full service club  Parking is  a day and it can take  to  minutes for them to retrieve your vehicle  Overall it is a ent hotel clean and centrally located but at the price I would look to other options first  
P => good location and price  
P => HOB Hotel is a Must  
P => House of Blues Hotel adventure  
P => Great hotel  
P => The best deal in Chicago  
P => Makin me Blue  
P => Apalling Service and Unsafe Atmosphere  
P => 
P => Perfect for sleep and shower Immediate reaction is quotwhat a dumpquot But we didnt plan on staying there except for sleep and showers since we were visiting to go to the U concert  Desk people were nice but dont expect to check in early  The did hang on to our luggage before check in and check out This is way dated  The halls smell like vomit  Room was stuffy and never got cold  Knobs are preset so cant change it  Shower wasnt great  Only mirror was in the bathroom  It wasnt bad but I would spend a little more money next time  Location is good expect to walk a lot  It is safe 
P => Adequate  better than it looks This is a good place for those who want to spend a fun weekend in downtown Chicago without spending too much  I would say it is a better place for adults traveling without children because most of those staying there when we were there a Saturday night in summer seemed to be there to go out to the bars etc  and there was some noise at night from the people across the hall from us coming and going  The room was an adequate size clean enough  The bed and pillows were not particularly comfortable amp I dont think they had changed the curtains since   The bathroom did seem to have been reated more recently  The little dinercafe at the front is your best bet for breakfast  there are not many other breakfast places in this neighborhood  There are some very good restaurants and places to go out at night nearby  just up the street there is a wonderful tapas restaurant and a couple blues clubs with really good music are also just a couple of blocks away  The location affordable for downtown Chicago price and friendly front desk clerk were the best aspects of this place  
P => Its allright True  It was kinda old but all the amenities worked except for the Wi Fi which was absent the first  days of my  day stay  The dinner is really nice too  The hotel provides really good value for the price  
P => Howard Johnson Downtown in NOISE we did DROWN This was the noisiest most chaotic place Ive ever stayed and in which I sought a nights sleep  Upon arrival I could not compel the WIFI to work with my computer only to be told by the desk that it had been quotdownquot with little or no interest or regard for my plight I was trying ot communicate with work  The first night we my dhter and I were assigned a secon story room quite old and a bit moldy that turned out to be accross the street from a quotravequot club  Oh nighte of nightes Three nights of that noise and vibration  The sescond night I tried to take my son back to his hotel we were there to here him present a paper I was told there might be no spot for my car when I returned  I informed the desk fellow who told me this that I had paid for the room in advance with the understanding parking was part of the deal with WIFI which NEVER worked ha  He ignored me as usual and said good luck  I did find a single space when I returned about pm  This place is a rediculous even by big cold city standards  It is OFF my list for my next stay in Chicago  My poor dhter never slept though I think she forgave me for the error  
P => LOVE the location but    My husband and our  children spent a night here last week so we could get an early start at the Shedd Aquarium the next day  Although the rooms we were in B were very small they were very well arranged  The rooms were very clean except if you move furniture dropped an earring and then you might see something yellow on the wall ewww but who normally goes back there anyway The water pressure was outstanding The location was incredible   very convenient to so much really  Portillos Art Institute Shedd museums Rock n Roll McDonalds etc  The only issues we had were that the heater in the room was very very noisy loud CLACK every  minutes it kept the room comfortable on quite a cold night and heated up in minutes after our arrival  The front desk staff was professional and courteous  The night watchman was a little creepy  Free parking which is a HUGE bonus in Chicago  They also had a really cute little diner attached which we didnt eat at but Id like to try at our next stay be  I would describe it as quotno frills but perfectly acceptablequot although they DID have a blowdryer an iron a fridge a coffee maker a TV an alarm clock a phone a table little shampoos conditioners soaps generous number of towels so yeah   be the frills were there afterall  
P => I stayed here at a historic time in Chicago Obama became the new man I stayed in this hotel the first week of  at a historic time for Chicago as a stranger in town I was suprised by the quality of the hotel having read the reviews I expected a drug dealer to be found dead in my bath tube but no The staff were very friendly the room was clean and the bed was large and the price was reasonable and I must give some praise to the staff in the restaurant out front the food was great especially the fetta omlette 
P => good for the price and location I booked  night before for under it was good for the price and location  It is a short bus ride down La Salle into the Loop  The area just next to the hotel isnt the best but I still felt safe  Staff was nice and held my bags while I was in the city  Little noisy in the morning with doors closing and house keeping cleaning in the hall  Also trash pick up must be close because I heard it in the morning If you are not a sound sleeper it  be annoying  overall its a good hotel be should be called a motel  
P => What a wreck The Staff was very cordial that is where it ended  I have never stayed in a hotel that was as ill kept run down and generally worn out as this one  If we had found another room anywhere in downtown we would have left  Unfortunately the town was completely booked  My dhter and grandhter were bitten by bugs as they slept The matresses were worn out wallpaper peeling in the bathroom carpets in the hallway and room were stained and worn    I dont understand how you could have your name on the outside of the building I have come to expect at least a moderately standard of cleanliness and upkeep   this location makes Motel  look like a palace  
P => Love at first site My wife and I met our friends Mike and Brenda in Chicago this past weekend  I have to say for all of us that this place was like hitting the lottery  All places we checked were really expensive and we were lucky enough to find the Howard Johnson at a very reasonable rate  Location Location Location We stayed there two nights and had such a great stay in Chicago  The hotel is very clean and always had that new frebreeze scent to it  Food in area is wonderful great entertainment close by and transportation was awesome you just cant beat those Chicago honking cabbies Next stop is the Ho Jo 
P => Good place central location free parking I have stayed here  nights  If you look for an inexpensive place at a central location then this is the place for you  The room is your standard motel room I booked on their website amp paid only night if a bit outdated  Parking is free and while I was there Thursday amp Friday nights finding a free spot was never a problem  Also I didnt worry about safety as the staff are watching closely who is entering the premises   
P => This place is horrible Were all looking for a great deal   and I was when I booked the HoJos on LaSalle in Chicago  But I would have much rather paid  more a night and not stayed in this DUMP  The exterior looks like something from the early    really run down  The person at the desk had bright red were talking stop sign red punker hair and had several of her kids running around the lobby  Not a real professional greeting for a hotel guest  The hallways outside the rooms look like a tennament house with old carpeting dirty walls and beat up doors  Our room was spacious and the bathroom looked dated but clean  The beds felt like we were sleeping on BOX SPRINGS  My husband and I were very uncomfortable all night  There was a night club outside our end unit room and we could hear a lot of noise all night  The only great thing about this place is the free parking  Our friends staying in the nicer Chicago hotels were paying  a day to park their vehicle  But Id rather incur that charge than stay here again  Why Howard Johnsons doesnt tear this place down and build a ent hotel in Americas thirdfourth largest city is beyond me  
P =>  nights in Hojo First time to Chicago as well as US  I went there for  night business  The hotel is ent a bit old though  The bedroom is spacious with a big king size bed  The bathroom is pretty nice as well  They have a restaurant which opens in the morning up to be  PM  I tried once and its quite good  The staffs are helpful dan courteous as far as I concern  The location is prime  Its close with train station red brown and purple line which is great for traveling  The price is quite acceptable for this hotel class There are some problems though  The wall seems pretty thin and if you have a bad luck with noisy neighbor it  disturb you  The ACheater is a bit noisy  The TV is rather old but its working properly for me  The lighting fixtures are old and unstable but theyre working and should not be an issue All in all its an enjoyable experience if you plan not to spend much time in your room  
P => Kinda shabby   but close to everything We stayed at the Howard Johnson on a recent busy weekend in Chicago and loved that this was downtown and close to public transportation and good food etc  The rates were a little high but not too bad for summer in Chicago Its great that theres parking available and we were lucky enough to arrive at a time around  p m  on a Friday when there were a few spots open although the guys that came in after me didnt get a spot  Good luck finding something nearbyEveryone at the front desk was nice but from the moment you walk in you feel like youre in the s  The hotel does not seem to have been updated for ades   which is kinda quaint and probably makes it easier to snag those good rates sometimes   but also kinda sad Our room was a ent size the air conditioning worked wonderfully and housekeeping was excellent  But just getting ice or a bottle of water made for a somewhat scary walk through dimly lit random hallways Overall   you wont feel like youre getting a bargain here even if you get a dicounted rate  Its just slightly shabby  But it is in a great part of town   near a subway stop and if youre into that sort of thing all the touristy stuff Ed Debevics Hard Rock Cafe Pizzeria Due etc    and Michigan Ave  shopping too  
P => this is value for money I have stayed at this hotel now twice and both times enjoyed the stay  The first time was in tember  I was in town for a wedding and spend  nights in de HoJo after that I spend  nights in the Intercontinental which I regret because the HoJo is much beter value for money  Last summer i stayed again in this place our room was small but clean and right next door to the cafe which serves a good breakfast Right next door is also a good Irish pub  Anyway if I have to book a hotel again in chicago this will be the one Ok it is outdated but on the other hand not as expensive      the rest downtown and also a good thing you can park your car onsite for free The staff do rent out the parking space on saturdaynight to earn some  themselves so you can forget to get your car than because the whole paking is full  
P => Not the height of luxury The hotel was in a good location easy to get around the city and close to lots of pubs and restaurants  The area felt safe enough  The outside of the building was a little run down and very retro  Our room was pretty bad and was quite expensive too at  a night  It really wasnt worth it and we would have been better off paying a bit more for something a lot better  Our room was extremely dated and felt quite dirty   I even found a previous customers toenail clippings by the bed Gross The ancient bathroom had no ventilation so was always damp  In fact the whole room was damp as testified by the huge damp patch above the bed on the ceiling  It was also an extremely cold room be because we were right at the end of the building  The room had a musty and dirty feel about it and I didnt really feel comfortable staying there   I dont recommend it  
P => A Great Hotel in a safe neighborhood I stayed two nights at the HoJo on LaSalle while in town on business I was a bit nervous about staying there after reading all the negative comments on the hotel but during my stay I found the hotel to be in a GREAT location the Brehorn Pub is right around the corner and has great food and an inviting atmosphere  The hotel itself features the Cafe Luna on site a great morning breakfast for a supreme value  I agree that the hotel does appear a bit dated on the exterior but I found my room to be in excellent condition appears to have had a fresh coat of paint and updated carpeting  The doors to the rooms are located inside so you have to use your pass card to get in that gave me a secure feeling  But the overall area of the hotel is buzzing with activity the Rainforest cafe and many other attractions are merely a  minute or so walk from the hotel  Michigan Ave  is just down the street  The L train station is about a  block walk I did it toting several pieces of luggage to get out to Midway if going that route plan for at LEAST an hour to get to Midway you have to transfer at the ClarkLake Street station Only drawback I could find was the lack of internet service there are public WiFi networks in the area but I could not get on them from the location of my room  I know its minor with so much nightlife surrounding this place I was better off not having the internet  
P => Terrific for the money We found it clean the help helpful everything satisfactory  The free parking is a big plus  If you want luxury dont stay here  the place looks like something out of the s  Im sorry for the fellow who had a hard time finding it but they do have street addresses inChicago  Excellent location by the way  easy to get everywhere you want to go  Weve stayed there several times and will continue to do so  
P => I didnt feel safe The first thing youll notice is that this place is incredibly difficult to find  I drove by it four times before I noticed it  Second the room had an unusual order that made my clothes stink  Third the swing lock chain lock on the door was missing  Fourth the sink in the bathroom was cracked and dirty  Fifth the alarm clock was broken  Sixth there was construction across the street so dont expect to get any peace and quite during the day  The only saving grace is the free parking but the construction left such a grime on my vehicle it wasnt worth it  Also Ive heard the restuarant was good but the place made me feel dirty so I didnt trust any food cooked on the premises  
P => Another Great Stay Another great stay at Howard Johnson  My girlfriend and I stayed here for a week to attend the Bears vs Falcons  Same great service  This is my third stay here with no problems  Rooms are always clean and the staff friendly  This year I had breakfast and lunch at the on site resturant and came away very impressed  
P => Satisfied Customer We stayed here in early  for two nights  We found the check in staff very friendly warm and welcoming We had no problems with the room it suited our needs of a place that was low on price great location to Chicago and most of all the diner attached to the complex was fantastic  I would definitely Recommend the breakfast 
P => TERRIBLE Dont make the same mistake as mine    I just chose this hotel because I checked this website and it is   in popularity  HOW COMEThe place is AWFUL Smells bad non secure linens are old disgusting  The window was broken there is no concierge and the staff cannot even indicate tourist spots  I paid USD per night and I really felt stupid  The location is not that great either  There is nothing in that area at night not even a cafeteria  I was just guided by the hotel popularity and I did the worst possible deal in Chicago I will never stay there again and do not recommend to anyone  
P => Ugh This place is awful  I stayed there the last weekend in y and was disgusted by the place  It smelled of urine in our room and in the hallway and it certainly didnt instill the feeling of security in its guests  Seriously it is worth the  to stay at a real hotel  Simply awful The ONLY good thing was the diner attached to the restaurant although that wasnt all that great either  
P => Great Deal After reading the mixed yet mostly positive reviews of this hotel I ided to give it a try  The price was right and couldnt be beat considering the location  We were within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile as well as the free trolley stops and tons of restaurants and shops  If we couldnt walk there we were close to the El stationThe room was a little small but clean and comfortable  It was so quiet that we thought perhaps no one else was staying there that weekend The free and secure parking was the best feature  It was so nice to be able to leave our car in one spot for the weekend and not have to worry about it We had breakfast at the little diner there and it was a great value Excellent prices for a HUGE breakfast For someone who wants the hotel to be a part of the vacation experience this  not be your best choice  But for someone who just needs a bed for the night and a great location at a great price HoJos Chicago cant be beat 
P => Great place to sleep If you are looking for a clean place with good location to downtown than this is the place  You can tell that this is an old hotel but the rooms and bathrooms were very clean and well kept  The staff were very helpful with directions and such  
P => OK if you just need a bed to crash I have stayed in Chicago at least  times in rooms ranging from extravagant to basic  This was by far the poorest experience I have ever had  Now I must admit that I was drawn by the low cost nt  in    of the room especially considering that they allow you to park for free This quotmotelquot was built in the s and very little has been done to update it  The property has two storys and is in a horseshoe shape  The front is open to the street and on several occasion during the stay people walked into the property that were obviously not staying there  The room smelled like mildew but was reasonably clean  The wallpaper was staind and the window was frosted over with filth Although I would never stay here again I got what I paid for I would actually recommend it for young travelers  If you are coming to Chicago on a shoestring to party this place would be just fine  Its cheap it a reasonably safe neighborhood despite some of the derelicts that hang around it and its quite close to the Mag Mile and Rush St  If your older and used to a ent property stay away  
P => For budget travel only   Clean cheap convenient not cozy or comfy Stayed here during a convention because it was one of the only ently priced places in town  After reading the reviews here I did expect something better  It is clean cheap and in a very convenient area   walking distance from a lot of things  And th free parking is a huge budget plus However it isnt the most attractive place  You wouldnt want to invite a colleague or client to meet you there  Theres not really a lobby  Its basically a motor lodge and it looks sort of run down  To get to my room I had to walk through the outside parking lot and into the covered parking area which is dark and deserted at night and a little creepy for a lone woman and then through a keycard locked door and then up a creaky elevator The room itself is of a good size  Theres no desk but there is a little round table you can use  No high speed internet but there is a data port  Connecting through the data port is painfully slow   I could never get more than  Kbps  And beware the phone charges   local calls are   to connect and   per minute after that Bathroom area is roomy with arate vanities which is convenient  The room door is thin and you can hear everything in the hall which also means people can hear whats going on inside your room  TV is old school but it works fine Overall this is a fine place to stay if youre visiting and want to be on a budget  For business travel its not very convenient  Id suggest trying Priceline to get one of the nicer hotels in Chicago for around the same price  Priceline has great deals in Chicago  
P => Inexpensive Yes  Comfortable  My husband amp I stayed at HoJos in early ober  because of recent positive reviews  Despite the low price and free parking we will not stay there again  Our room was more than worn out  The vanity in the bathroom had been partially stripped of veneer with the other half left untouched  Entrance signage to the parking lot is bad drove around the block twice before seeing it Most disappointing is the location  We returned from the Lyric Opera after pm on a Sat  night and stopped by some Irish pubs in the area but the noisedrunk level was intolerable  We landed at the Chop House and had a very nice dinner but do not go there for an inexpensive meal  The steaks range from  to ounces so go there only if you want a huge steak  Very few non meat items but the service was superb  Back to Ho Jos  if youre ever in Madison WI stay at the Howard Johnsons on West Johnson Immaculate up to date rooms great staff and a barrestaurant on the premise  The Madison WI Howard Johnsons is within walking distance of the UW Madison campus State Street and the State Capitol  
P => HoJo in Chicago is surprisingly wonderful I visited the Howard Johnson in Chicago on Labor Day weekend  I read all the reviews on it before I booked so I kinda knew a little of what to expect  But I was still surprised at how great this hotel was  If youre on a budget its awesome  The rate I got was reasonable for Downtown Chicago on a holiday weekend  The diner attached was were we ate breakfast each day we stayed there  It was great and the prices were great too  Fabulous coffee The room was average size but it was clean  The shower had great pressure so that was great too Also the free parking was a major plus I definitely will stay there again 
P => great hotel  
P => Excellent  
P => Great Location Friendly Staff Authentic Diner  
P => A rare gem in Downtown Chicago   
P => An absolutely cracking bargain  
P => Excellent location   unbeatable value  
P => Great value  
P => did I mention FREE parking  
P => Hotel molto gradevole  
P => 
P => Beautiful view    everything else disappointed The Hyatt has an amazing unobstructed view over the river and its beautiful at night  Its location is superb situated two minutes from the start of the Magnificent Mile and all the shopping you can endure  However thats pretty much where it ends for me  Rooms were average poorly orated and not  star quality  The iPod functionality on my clock was broken no pens were provided in room and colleagues who stayed on other floors constantly complained about noise and distractions that prevented them from getting a good nights rest  Sources of noise include  Elevator doors openingclosing  Elevator gears  Street noise  Water running through the pipesUnfortunately all the noises above were not momentary but persisted through the entire night due to the placement of their rooms and throughout the week we stayed at the Hyatt  Its almost like the building was designed with no consideration for sound proofing To also not have internet included at the price we paid was almost highway robbery    isnt it archaic to still charge for in room internet nowadaysWith that said the hotel is still a ent stay  The service was acceptable and friendly  The location was convenient and the view was amazing  I would still recommend this to a friend  If you can find a good deal on this place its worth it otherwise Id suggest looking at other hotels in the area around Michigan Avenue  
P => Nice business hotel very well located  This was a very good and positive surprise  This hotel has be only  drawbacks  Bad isolation from the hall like every other hotel in USA  It might get crowded at conference time because this baby is BIG    Otherwise the amenities are very good with a nice gym and spa shops in the basement and the staff is impeccable as usual at Hyatt  Good experience  
P => Very nice hotel kind of busy  Very impressed by the hotel  It was like a mini mall  Parking was nearby hotel parking was a ripoff though charging  per night just to park  Good value name your own price on Priceline got the hotel for like  US  Rooms were nice and staff was friendly  Lot of people though around the main foyer  Kind of far from popular Chicago attractions  
P => Great Updated Room with Great View Check is was fast and professional  We were assigned a corner room with a great view of the river and some downtown landks  The room itself was spotless and totally updated although on the small side  The carpet was new the bed was comfortable and the high definition flat screen was top notch as well  The ble shower and vanity were quite nice  The water pressure was very good and hot water plentiful  Considering the size of the room itself the bathroom was quite large  This Hyatt is a huge property that gets it right both with their rooms and service  
P => Excellent location   good hotel They Hyatt Regency is a huge hotel   the layout is confusing at first as there are two towers and you have to go back and forth between  The location is excellent   just next to the Chicago River very close to Lake Michigan and right off Michigan Avenue for shopping and dining  The staff at the hotel were uniformly polite friendly and helpful  I had a very small room though it overlooked the river so the view was great  The items that make me give this hotel a  rating instead of  are the following relatively limited room service menu   with almost no vegetarian items very poor lighting in the room energy efficient fluorescent bulbs in  tiny lamps   so dark I could not see to open the combination luggage lock I have pretty limited television channel lineup on the in room tv  There is a nice little coffee and food stand downstairs in the atrium area that sells more than just pastry for breakfast fruit cereal snacks even ice cream so its easy to get some food while avoiding a restaurant  Overall this is a very nice hotel  
P => Great View   Great Time We booked this hotel through Priceline for  a night but would have found it a good value at twice that when location and amenities are considered  I have infrequently been given inferior room when booking with Priceline  My price was about  the going Internet rate  So when checking in I often state I realize there is probably not much you can do because this is a Priceline room  The desk persons reply to that comment was quotwho says soquot She then gave us a nice room with a great view on the st floor looking out on the Chicago river and lake Michigan  I tipped her  and she was very appreciative as was I I would absolutely stay here again but the  valet parking fee is not good and there are other parking options nearby that I would explore  I was told that Hyatt has allocated money to this property for room reations and that work is underway  While our room hadnt been newly remodeled it was certainly a very nice room with a large Plasma tv   
P => Great Location   Good Hotel My wife and I booked a one night stay at this hotel via Priceline  We got the room for  dollars so it would be hard to complain about the price  The hotel itself is enormous and attached to a convention center  The check in was quick and efficient  The lobby is nice although it definitely has the feeling of an airport terminal  There are something like  rooms in this hotel and the lobby reflects that type of activity  Our room was actually very nice and what I felt it was exceptionally clean and well appointed  The bathroom was slightly dated but overall we were satisified with the room  The location of this hotel is perfect for anyone visiting Chicago  The hotel is just a block aways from Michigan avenue and very close to many shops and restraunts  The hotel bars were nice  We found the food at the breakfast buffet to be good but not quite worth the   fee for the buffet  Skip the buffet and walk around the corner to a local resterant  I would definitely consider staying here again assuming I was getting a discounted rate on priceline  I would never consider staying at this hotel if I was going to be paying the full rate as their are much nicer hotels in the area for the same price in the area  
P => Hub of downtown with some down sides We enjoy staying at Hyatt Hotels usually  My husband had a conference here all week so I was a solo tourist diner amp guest for the most part  This Hyatt is very large amp the rooms are of typical Hyatt designspaciousness  Not very much room to store clothing though only  clothes hangers in the closet   so bring your own  No counter space in bathrooms either  Our air unit was brokenso the temp was really hot upon arrival but housekeeping was prompt to fix it  Our door keys were disengaged twice but also promptly fixed once we showed our I D s to guest services  For our troubles they gave us a fruit bowl  The fitness center is small but the equipment is newclean  The spa staff were very pushy w services  All i wanted was a haircut but the facial lady literally booked me for a facial wo my request and insisted it would be the best facial ever  I ended up walking out  She even followed me down the hall still trying to make quotthe sell quot The food in the Bistro is not comparable with the price   dinner or breakfast  Youd do better finding someplace down the street  Every time I ate there the waiter would bring the check to me immediately after taking my order which I thought was rude  And they do take away your food before youre finished   a lot of language barriers with wait staff here  But the quotBig Barquot is nice if youre into a happy hour scene  Good conference center for business too  I would say if youre here for a conference or enjoy being in the hub of downtown this will work for you  day for internet is surprising for a semi luxury hotel though  Even Motel  has free wi fii 
P => Not bad We booked our reservation online and had gotten a pretty good deal it was less than  per night but if we had paid the original room fee it wouldve definitely been a HUGE disappointment  The location is amazing   its right between the Sears Tower and State Street on Michigan Avenue  Its a nice hotel if youre not going to spend much time in the room but if you are then its not the greatest  They have a weight system on the mini bar if you move anything in the bar youll be charged for whatever it is that moved  If you BUMP into it and anything moves youll be charged for that So if youre traveling with children make sure they dont come near the mini barWe didnt try the restaurants in the hotel but be sure NEVER to try the restaurant next door to the Hyatt Houlihans   its the worstOverall it wasnt a bad stay but it wasnt what we expected from the Hyatt  
P => Good Business Hotel needs some updating I attended a conference at the hotel recently and stayed for  days  Its OK showing a little wear  the concierge floor is nice and the staff is great  
P => Love this hotel Call me crazy but I just love this hotel  Ive been to Chicago at least twice a year for the last  or  years and this Hyatt just captures the big city vibe in its own unique way  The lobby in the East tower is both warm and welcoming when you arrive back at the hotel yet you are engulfed by the sheer numbers of guests milling around the facilities the views    the rooms are always comfortable and I would agree with the reviewer who mentions putting a rolled tower under the door space to muffle any hallway noise  Staff is excellent dining options are good and the location is outstanding  I love this place 
P => Well located but huge conference style hotel Spacious rooms and friendly service depsite being a monster of a hotel  Clean and functionable and in a good location 
P => LOUD The restaraunts and the gym were very nice but the room was very loud you could hear everything in the adjacent rooms and the housekeeping staff were extremely loud in the morning out in the hallways also the bathroom was not very clean   the floor was sticky and the counter top was stained 
P => Great Location We live in the burbs but wanted a nice getaway for the weekend as we had dinner and theater plans for the weekend  We ended up at the Hyatt Regency via Hotwire  We got a rate at about   off of the rack rate on the Hyatt website  After talking to people this seems to be a hotel that comes up on the discount hotel sites hotwire priceline often as it is HUGE  We were happy we ended up here  It was convenient to everything  We parked at the Millenium Park garage for  for  hours  There werent in and out privileges like the valet parking at the hotel which was about  but since everything was close that wasnt needed  We walked down Michigan Ave and considered going to Navy Pier but it was just too darn cold out  Our room was nice and the bed was great  We were at the end of a hallway in the West building so the noise factor was minimal  We had drinks at the Big Bar and DaddyO  Both were typical hotel bars nice atmosphere but a bit pricey  The staff was friendly and attentive  While I dont think Id pay the rack price for this hotel Id be willing to gamble on the discount sites to get something like this again  
P => Good value huge good for many occasions We stayed in this hotel for the Chicago athon  It was so busy that at first it felt like we arrived at an airport instead of a lobby  The hotel could use a major update to keep up with the newer stylish hotels in the city  Our room in the west tower was spacious comfortable just a bit too dark  We didnt experience any problems with noise from the hallway or other rooms  Location is great  Right in between the magnificent mile and milenium park  
P => Older hotel but Chicagos largest and best location downtown There are some issues with the hotel being older  The walls are paper thin the bathroom layout is kind of old fashioned etc but for the location its just excellent I saw some people complaining about the noise  One thing I noticed is about a quot gap of airspace between the bottom of our door and the floor  This is a major cause of the noise If you place one of your bathroom towels across this gap at night youll find it to be quite a bit more quiet    at least for the noises in the hallways The other tip is to arrive in Chicago by some other means than a car  The  a night for parking is rough 
P => Horrible bloody expensive Stayed there for a tradeshow  Hotel Lobby looks more like an airport or factory  I dont know if all the rooms were as terrible as in the East tower but I asked  times for another room and  times I got the same poor quality the rooms are very old old carpet yellow curtains dirty windows and the bathroom hasnt been upgraded since a long time  Although the view on the lake was great the rest was just horrible the doors have an opening of around  cms between door and carpet no need to say you have the impression to sleep in the corridor and the old airco systems had to be turned down because of the noice  The breakfast room hall is not cozy the bar is nice but expensive  Ill never go back 
P => An excellent deal Stayed both at this Hyatt Regency and the Hyatt Regency at McCormick Place last week on a business trip  My stay at this Hyatt was purchased on priceline for considerably less than the posted rate and I have to say it was a fabulous deal  I have done the priceline thing for  star hotels many times in several cities and this was probably the nicest hotel I have gotten out of priceline yet  The most important thing to me regarding hotels are clean and comfortable rooms and good service and it didnt disappoint on those ks  Our room was very clean I meticulously check rooms as soon as I enter and I was satisfied  The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly at check in check out and during our stay  We were able to check in at around  am on a Thursday despite one conference leaving Chicago and one coming in  The exterior of the hotel itself has no wow factor and is not particularly impressive and the lobby is spacious but was probably last reated in the mid s   meaning not modern but still nice enough  The rooms themselves seem more modern which is more important to me  Very comfortable beds  I got around by walking taxi and conference shuttle and I found it convenient but someone who wanted to drive might consider a different location  There is a grocery store nearby on Stetson Ave if you want to purchase snacks  I would happily stay here again on my next trip to Chicago  
P => perfect location stayed here for athon weekend  The location was perfect right between Michigan avenue and Millenium park  We had no issues with noise as other reviews have stated  The room was a basic hotel room  The beds were comfortable  The only disadvantages were a fee for internet service and no refrigerator  Otherwise it was just what we needed  
P => Pretty good if you get a room with a view  This hotel is in an amazing location  The exterior of the hotel is pretty dated and the lobby has an early s cheesy feel    but the hotel has pretty good service and if youre lucky a fantastic view  The office portion of my room  overlooked millenium park  Unfortunately I didnt get much work done  absolutely beautiful view The room itself was nice and rather modern although looked a bit worn in  Not a bad size  What perplexed me was that there was a dusty mini bartv stand yet the room had no dresser  I stayed for  days it would have been nice to unpack The gym was a ent size and had some great cardio with integrated tvs  nice touch   There are a lot of hotels in this part of town  This was a good place to stay but this Hyatt Regency isnt as great as some others at which Ive stayed  
P => An alright experience but theyre about to start reating The hotel is composed of an East Tower and a West Tower  I checked in at the East Tower and upon entering was fairly impressed with the first floor and lobby  It was am when I checked in but the bar on the second floor was hopping  Because I checked in so late I expected the check in process to go quickly but the clerk was quite slow We were given a room in the west tower and stayed on the th floor  It was a standard king room with a large desk armchair and ottoman and flat screen television  The wallpaper was peeling in a few places and the lighting in the bathroom was terrible  The water pressure in the shower wasnt the greatest either Location wise the hotel was in a central area   just one block from Michigan Avenue  We spoke with a maintenance man on our last night and he explained that starting next month they would be reating the entire hotel to make complete updates   bathroom lighting shower central air and heat etc  I think these reations are exactly what the hotel needs  The experience was bad so to speak but Ive stayed in better places for less money The high speed Internet is  a day and so slow that its not worth it Parking in the hotel garage is  per day  Theres another garage a couple blocks away for about  per day  
P => Modern and nice Staff was very accommodating during our arrival  The room was spacious and modern with a large flat screen TV that swiveled  The bedding was of a nice quality and the bed was comfortable  I liked the or which was modern with touches of quality  The hotel is suitable for large conferences so it takes some walking to find your way around  
P => Great location for the price one block from Magnificent Mile Everyone we encountered was very helpful  The room was clean and updated  The hotel couldnt have been in a better location  One block from the Magnificent Mile and about  blocks from Navy Pier  Perfect location to everything  The only thing that was confusing about the hotel was where to check in there are east and west towers  A bit confusing but still worth it  
P => Bugs in food and bug in bed Poor experience for the expense  I attended a conference and my husband accompanied and stayed  nights  Room is regular nothing fancy hotel room  My husband found a bug in his salad at Bistro  in the hotel and then on last morning found another bug in his bed Lighting is poor  Bathroom is small  Sound travels  Location is good and when bottom floor entrance to other shops is open for lunch and breakfast prevents going outside in bad weather  
P => Good business hotel but there are better values Ive stayed at this Hyatt for almost  years and have seen it through many reations and changes  Its a good downtown hotel with convention and catering facilities and a very busy lobby area where you can still find people when trade shows are in town  Paid internet  Convenient to Michigan Avenue some nice views from higher floors  Can be expensive compared to the services provided  My most recent visit had to go to three rooms first one had odor second was occupied by someone else and third finally was okay had never had problems before  If youre in town for a meeting this is a fine facility  If youre just staying in town there  be better deals  
P => Lovely hotel would stay here again    We stayed at the Hyatt Chicago athon weekend  The hotel itself is extremely huge and was very busy because of the athon  We booked on Priceline and got a phenomenal rate  Checking in at  on Friday was very busy and we had to wait in line around  minutes  Check in went very fast once we reached the counter we asked for two rooms and we were granted them for no additional cost  We were on the th floor overlooking the River  The room itself was very clean nice size and had all the amenities one would need when traveling  Comfortable beds nice flat screen TV data port iron blow dryer  The bathroom was fairly large and inviting  The shower head was pretty amazing especially after a long race  All in all I like the hotel staff location and beds  Michigan Ave is hop skip and jump away  There are a plethora of Starbucks corner bakery and restaurants in the area  My only complaints were waiting  minutes for an elevator in the am the  charge for parking and having to wait  minutes for valet to come and assist when parking our car  I would definitely stay here again and suck up the  parking charge  
P => Cool lobby and good location but rooms and service could be better Was here for a conference for two nights and the location was great but I think its just too big a hotel to be really outstanding  First of all the rooms need better lighting  Even with all of the lamps on theres no overhead lighting it felt really dark and drab  Also my room was supposedly a non smoking one but it still smelled of smoke  The bathroom wasnt terrible but the grouting between the tub tiles was kind of gross and needed to be cleaned or redone  It also irked me that you had to specifically notify them if you wanted fresh towels every day  Ive stayed at places with a quottowels on the floor will be replaced towels hung up wontquot set up and thats fine but to have to make a call was ridiculous  I had some clothes laundered and when they were returned to me they also left me another guests shirt which I took down to the front desk  My colleague and I had both unknowingly we must have just clicked the first option presented when making the reservation signed up for a quotbusiness planquot room reservation which included breakfast free wifi and some other things but when she checked in they didnt tell her any of this or give her the vouchers for breakfast  If I hadnt told her she wouldnt have ever known they did charge her for wifi but took it off of her bill when she mentioned it to them  So while it wasnt terrible there are lots of better options especially for the price  
P => Very pleasant hotel in a fantastic location My husband and I stayed at this hotel while traveling to Chicago for pleasure  The hotel is well located directly off of the Magnificent Mile  It is a bit of a walk from the blue line stop if flying into OHare but not too bad  The hotel was nice and we were received excellent service  
P => In this hotel the walls CAN AND DO talk This hotel is fairly expensive which I expect given the excellent location  They should REALLY do something about the sound transfer between rooms which is absolutely atrocious  As I sit typing this at AM listening to the people talking in conversational tones in the next room  I have been awake for the past two hours ever since the occupant came back with a prostitute honest to God I laid awake listening to every detail from payment to completion in gory detail  Earlier I could hear the occupant of the room on the other side urinating to the last drop  This was not from my bathroom mind you but my bed  We might as well be in tentsIf the quotneighborsquot were being loud I would complain but they have every right to speak in conversational tones and perform their bodily functions so here I am The rooms are clean and comfortable the place is attractive if slightly dated  Parking is day  At the restaurant in the lobby  eggs with bacon is  so we went ahead and had the buffet for  which was very good as it should be for that price  Internet is a gouge at dayThe location is good facility acceptable but I will never stay here again due to the lack of soundproofing  I really expect better from a Hyatt  
P => Great location for touring Chicago This hotel very obviously caters to the business world but there were plenty of couples and some families too  Staff was courteous and prompt  My biggest complaint would be the day fee to park Our room was clean amp had a spectacular view out to the river and lake our room was in the hotels west tower in the northeast corner th floor  We got to take in the fireworks out on the lake from our room both Friday and Saturday nights  Great location for touring the city   Millenium Park is just a few blocks to the south Navy Pier is a not far to the east its right on the river there are restaurants tucked under the major bridgesroads right along the river plus its just off of Michigan Avenues fabulous shopping amp surrounding restaurants there is soooooo much amazing food there  The architectural river tour was wonderful   the river a great vantage point to take in the citys wealth of architecture  
P => Nice room great location We were very pleased with our stay at this hotel  The room was nice and clean  The hotel staff and hotel amenities were great  We got a great internet rate  The location is perfect   close to theaters and restaurants  Would definitely stay there again  
P => If you dont mind hotels with  rooms this one was a great buy    I was on the fence about attending a four day conference in Chicago at the Palmer House because the conference rate there was  a night and I was on a limited budget  I ided to go but used Princelines name your own price option to find a   hotel and ended up at the Hyatt Regency on Wacker for  a night  To further cut costs I ided to use not take a taxi from the airport and opted for the train which was very easy to use  It was a tight squeeze getting through a few of the turnstiles with my rolling bag and I had to walk a few blocks to the hotel from the closest station but the   round trip sure beat the cabfare  The hotel had a Realtors conference going on at the same time so the lobby and check in reminded me of the check in at a Vegas hotel but it all ran smoothly and my room was nice  The hotel was close to everything I needed and I walked just about everywhere I was going including the conference I was attending at the Palmer House  It was also close to Millenium Park and since I arrived on a Sunday and had the day to myself I took one of the Segway tours that left from a site a couple of blocks away and had a blast riding around the area seeing the sites  
P => Great Location Ideally situated in the center of the city this hotel offered easy walking acces to Millenium Park the Art Museum and great restaurants within the Loop  Rooms were spotless and beds were comfy  
P => Great location nice hotel I was in Chicago ober  through ober  with my husband and  young children  The Hyatt is a very large hotel so is a bit impersonal  I would have prefered to stay at a property with some history but I had recieved this reservation through Priceline and got a great deal  For the price I paid this hotel was just fine The hotel is clean and well kept  The beds were nice with plenty of pillows  Our room was clean and updated  The bathroom was nice with a granite vanity and a spectacular view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan  I would not consider this hotel luxurious but was nice just nothing spectacular  The location of the hotel is prime  It is a short walk to north Michigan Ave  the Loop and the museums I encountered one small problem when my housekeeper threw away a grocery bag of snacks  This matter was resolved quickly and courteously by the housekeeping manager We were happy with the hotel and would stay here again 
P => Wonderful location in heart of Chicago The service was excellent we had booked the room online with our flight got a great rate for  days  Our room was nice had a fridge with treats which we used for our leftovers  The lobby had a coffee shop and there were restaurants in the hotel  Our room overlooked the Chicago River and the Chicago skyline it was fabulous to look out at night  The bed was comfortable with a variety of pillows the room was clean  The concierge service was a great help in locating how to get places particularly whether to use our bus pass or walk  Usually it was quicker to walk and they verified the safest routes for the evening  We were very close   blocks from Millenium Park and the trains  We didnt use the restaurants they were too pricey but there was a coffee shop  blocks away as well as a Houlihans which was reasonable for a drink and meal  
P => The location is great but services are pricy We are students and went there for sightseeing  The hotel is near the loop and many places of interests  However since we are on a tight budget we paid extremely careful attention not to use additional room services  I think that a lower starred hotel which could provide free internet connection in rooms might be a better choice for students like us  Other than this everything is nice  
P => hotel in perfect location for seeing and doing lots The hotel was ideal for all we wanted to see and do while there  I wished we could have flown because parking was OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to park our car and never use it  We walked everywhere  We paid extra for the view of Lake Michigan and so glad we did  Everyone was helpful and friendly  I didnt like being charged for internet and refridgerator use  The beds were super comfy and the rooms were very clean  Not enough drawer space for clothing but closet was large  Take extra hangers though  
P => dingy run down rooms with no air The room was dingy and run down   it felt like staying in a cheap motel  The carpet was exceptionally worn wallpaper peeling bathroom grout dingy  The place felt like it hadnt been reorated in  years  On top of that the windows would not open not unusual for a hig rise hotel and there was no air fan for ac or heat   how the temp control was supposed to work I have no idea they said radient cooling whatever that is but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation  We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated  So much for privacy I cant comment on the food because we ate out at every chance  Chicago has some fantastic food And much of it within easy distance to the hotel  The hotel is in a good location near the waterfront and millenium park shopping and dining  The conference facilities were average but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non existent I will never stay in this hotel again especially for the price because of the poor room quality  
P => Nice pleasant stay Stayed here the week of Labor Day via a quotname your pricequot site and for the price the Hyatt exceeded our expectations  The property was clean the staff was courteous and the location central There was a convention being hosted at the Hyatt while we there but it wasnt a problem  Also just by coincidence we were blocks away from Oprahs anniversary kickoff celebration  That was a bonus We used the fitness center with nice new weight machines plenty of cardio equipment with individual TVs and even connections to hook up your Ipod We didnt dine at any of the on site restaurants so we cant comment on them other than they were not inexpensive  The quotBig Barquot was pretty cool  It is their on site bar which is literally very big with a very quotbigquot tini glass to greet you at the entrance  The one minor issue we had was the layout of the room  The nice large TV was positioned to the side of the bed which made it a little awkward to watch  I guess this was to make room for the pullout couch at the foot of the bed  Not a big deal since we were not in Chicago to watch TV   
P => Excellent customer service but watch their rates  The Hyatt is located on the river downtown within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile many restaurants Millennium Park and Navy Pier  I had an th floor room with river view and it was much more spacious and comfortable than the Allerton Hotel downtown  There are two towers which got a bit confusing trying to navigate underground to get to an adjoining office building  But there is a cozy Irish pub O Daddys and the very trendy and pricey Big Bar known for fancy cocktails  There is also a steakhouse that looked pretty upscale and I didnt try it since I was alone  For breakfast the lobby cafe is fast and convenient for coffee bagels etc  Be prepared to pay for internet anywhere in the hotel  I avoided this by going pretty much anywhere else like coffee shops bars nearby that have free wifi  the downside I got back home and looked at the bill in more detail  I was not prepared for what the single rate was with no extras at all  My company and I researched it to make sure I was not overcharged  What I was charged per night was nearly twice what was listed on the internet for the same room  Apparently for these particular weeknights in late tember all hotels in that area were charging that much and this was even the cheapest  There are always conferences going on in Chicago but I still dont know why these nights were so hot  be something to do with the Olympics The upside the helpful staff  I realized on the flight home I left my cell phone in my room  I called when I got home and security found it and assured me it was in a safe  Customer service took my information and made arrangements with FedEx for me to have it shipped home  I opted for overnight delivery and received it right on time intact  I was sure it was going to be broken  I was really in a panic about it getting stolen so it was reassuring to know they were taking care of it They are also on the Go Airport Shuttles route if you are flying inout of OHare  
P => A great Stay    great hotel and great location We stayed at the Hyatt Regency   we actually found a great deal and we had a wonderful stay  We read some reviews before so we asked for a reated roon with a great view and we were very pleased    a couple of us even got a huge suite for the same price service is very good rooms are big enough and very clean  Perfect location 
P => This hotel was really nice and had a convenient location but expect to pay for all amenities The location of the hotel was amazing very central  We were very happy with our room and the location  However expect to pay high fees for all amenities that you  want  It is really expensive to park there  You have to pay for wireless and you even have to pay use the refrigerator  
P => Nice hotel in GREAT central location My husband amp I visited Chicago for our anniversary in tember  I was able to get a great rate for the Hyatt on Priceline com  The hotel was clean the rooms were nice and the service was good  If you are looking for something unique or swanky this is not it  The Hyatt is a perfectly nice above average hotel but is not special  While in our room we could have been in any city but our view was ent amp we spent most of our time out and about  Transportation is nearby amp there is lots to see and do within walking distance  One downside   the parking is extremely expensive even if you are a guest  I would recommend parking down a couple of blocks in a parking structure  We really enjoyed our stay amp could not have found a better hotel for the price we paid  
P => Great Location No atmosphere Tired Stayed for four nights  Excellent location to most things we wanted to see including Navy Pier the Loop Millenium Park Theatre district etc  Conference style hotel with more than  guests  Room tired  furntiture dented and carpet dirty  Bed comfy and plenty of pillows towels etc  Long corridors that lack any character more like cilivised prison  Guest nearby with dog barking quite often  Couldnt wait to get out of the hotel each day as crowds constantly milling around waiting for shuttle buses on their blackberrys talking business etc The hotel bills you  per day if you put anything in their bar fridge in the room No free internet to check your email  
P => Expected a great stay and I got one  Nice place for business travel  Utterly bland for vacations leisure etc    The locations is a dead zone at the end of Wacker a little depressing  Also the view of neighboring condos is voyeuristic and a bit strange That said the food is pretty good hey its Chicago the food is good even when its bad and the rooms are reated spacious and comfortable  Beds were very nice They do a nice job with business travelers   a safe choice  They quotget it quot 
P => Great Hotel We arrived at  am on a Friday and they had a room ready for us by  am mind you check in is not until pm  We got our room on Priceline for   per night and stayed  nights  We were upgraded   for free   to a suite  I think I was so blown away by that that I forgot to thank them at check in Our room was fantastic  It also had a wet bar and a fridge  The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers  I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini bar  The bed and pillows were very comfortable  The room was very clean  Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful  We stayed on the th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room  Yes you could hear people in the hallways but only because they were rude and were yelling  These were not children they were adults  I dont know why everyone complains about  for parking  This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much some without inout privledges We didnt use any of the restaurants or the health club  We tried to eat at the Corner Bakery but it was too crowded  Breakfast at nearby Houlihans had a buffet for   per person  Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great  There is a   not too far away I dont know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel  Yes its a big hotel  If you dont want a busy lobby dont stay in a  plus room hotel I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone  Not one problem  Wasnt too busy for me  Would stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Why do I have to drink AF The Hyatt Regency Chicago on E  Wacker is admittedly the largest hotel in Chicago  Still is there any reason why their coffee service has only  single serving of regular coffee and  of af I thought this was just a housekeeping oversight which a call down to housekeeping failed to rectify but when we changed rooms on Day Two in order to get a king bedded room we realized that this is the normal set up  Apparently you can only have one caffeine addict in the family  Also you have to reconcile yourself to wet hair when you shower as they do NOT provide shower caps  Also I do not know if this true for all king bedded rooms but in ours East Tower the bed is at right angles to the very large flat screen TV  You have to be gymnasts to watch TV whilst in bed On the handy side there are two computers next to the concierges desk where you can print out your boarding passes  The bell caps do a yeomans job handling mountains of luggage left by     all those people who are out looking at the city before their late flight The hotel is well served by cabs and the location is pretty much as central as you can be The architectural boat tours leave from the riverfront just below the hotel the River Walk is very pleasant also and are highly recommended  
P => surprisingly good The hotel is huge has east and west wings  Its a businessconvention hotel but accomodating to family  Has refrigerator upon request  Has microwave and toaster in lobby for self service use  Food is expensive  Plenty of restaurants nearby  Very conveniently located to CTA train system  There is a small grocery and Walgreen nearby  From OHare airport take CTA blue line and exit Clark cost    From there take taxi or walk about  blocks to hotel  Have fun 
P => Motel  in Downtown Chicago The rooms are nothing special  They were relatively clean but you might as well be in a motel off I  theres really no difference  Theyre due for a reation and we found out that there are plans to reate much of the hotel next year  Location is great  Try to find a deal if you plan on staying here because it would be a shame to spend anything more than  a night on a standard room  We got a deal at Priceline so no complaints Breakfast buffet is over pp and room service breakfast is also outrageously priced but youre in Chicago  Parking   the hotel is  per night with unlimited inout privileges but if youre planning on just parking your car and not using it the lot right next to the hotel on Wacker Drive charges  per  hours so you can save a few buck doing that  
P => Mediocre Hotel with Good Customer Service This is a huge hotel in a very nice location  Pretty much everything is within a fairly walkable distance  Rooms are fine orated nicely but obviously see a LOT of traffic in and out  Extremely noisy   at all times in the room     I could hear full conversations from the hallway and conversations from the neighbors     including their bathroom use and flushing I could even hear the elevator going updown and floor stops  This becomes extremely irritating after about an hour  Bathrooms could use some major updating  I hate mold in the shower and cracks in joints and floor  Also   a day for wifi is ridiculous   a day charge to keep food or drinks in the mini fridge is ridiculous immediate charge for touching or picking anything up in fridge     due to weight sensors      ridiculousCustomer Service wise   everyone I encountered was friendly smiling and helpful at all times  No problems in this area  Generally pretty much everyone I encountered in this city was friendlyTip   I asked the front desk for a floor fan to drown on the noise  Great call Worked perfectly 
P => Noisy West Tower Was there attending a conference so paid full price for a standard room in the west towerper nite  Not as lucky as those getting a room for   a night  The room had a nice view  looked out on the river toward Navy Pier on the th floor  or had not changed since the last time stayed there about  years ago  Control of the heatingcooling lacked  The room was always too warm no matter the setting  Room was very noisy  Could hear water flowing through the sewer pipes  Also could hear the bathrooms being used on both sides of the room as well as conversations  Brought to attention of the front was told that was a common problem  Was informed that the west tower is slated for updating  Was offered a cup of coffee in the lobby restaurant as compensation for the noise by the front desk Location is great  Just off Michigan Avenue over looking the river  Its close to many attractions restaurants etcIf you get a room for  on priceline take it  Paying full price check out other hotels in the area  Parking is  per night Do not know how the east tower is but avoid the west tower   
P => Great location and view I booked a room through Priceline for  and later read I mightve gotten it for   Anyway we were happy with the room and had a great view of the river water taxis Hancock Center part of the Wrigley Building from the rd floor    beds and pillows were very comfortable AC worked quite well  Restaurant over priced    go to nearby Corner Bakery and Cafe for breakfast  Great location if you want to use the Water Taxis and catch the architectural boat tours both of which depart from right in front of the hotel  We were told the hotel is soon to undergo a complete remodel  Our room was nice but the toilet was a bit stained and sometimes didnt flush well  We could hear thumps and bumps from other rooms plus loud people in the hall one night  
P => Watch for hidden fees Our stay at the Hyatt was great and the hotel itself was wonderful  It is a very busy hotel and tends to have a lot of people in the lobby area  We had a wonderful stay and thanks for those reviews that advised to be careful of the mini bar  We did not open it which was great as there was a sign on it that said anything that gets moved in the mini bar could cause a charge to your account  We also discovered that if you place a local call that there is a   connection fee that they do not tell you about until after you make the call  So be careful not to use the phones  Also we were not aware that there were two levels for valet parking  We waited in the main lobby for our car and was told it was waiting downstairs  The valet did eventually bring it up to us  Also valet pricing is   a night so be carful with that and the only city parking that they recommended was two blocks away  It was well worth the   a night  Great hotel and will stay again but will not use the phone  
P => Can a Hotel Be  Too Nice   I guess some hotels are quottoo fancyquot to have complimentary breakfast this ones is  per person free wireless Internet  a day or free parking  a night for paying guests  The water pressure was mediocre and the room temperature was always a little too warm  What youre really paying for is the location which is very good and there are five restaurants attached to the hotel  The experience of walking through the lobby is spectacular however you can get that experience for free without staying here  Overpriced I would not stay here again  
P => Very Good Location Fine Service Comfy Room The hotel was well located in downtown Chicago  Close to Navy Pier and Millennium Park  Several buses stopped across the street from the hotel and the El subway was about  blocks away  Just down the street from several architecturally significant buildingsIn hotel Starbucks restaurant and large bar  Breakfast buffet one block away at Houlihans Pub was a great valueThe room was adequate with a king bed and flat screen tv  Internet was provided at a fee  Beware of the mini bar    we opened it to chill a bottle of water we brought and wound up having to remove charges from our hotel bill 
P => Great Location Older nice hotel  Do not open the mini bar if you move anything it will automatically be added to your bill ie the  snickers bar and  bottle of mini wine  The hotel has all the amenities except a pool  It had a very nice gym for a hotel with several different types of aerobic and weight machines  We didn t eat at the restaurant because there were so many other great places in town but they looked good from the outside  We had a terrific view of the river from our room  At first the motel seemed overstaffed but it turned out that they were extremely helpful and attentive even with the bellman telling us where we could park for free   which was a bargain when the valet was night If you can avoid having a car in Chicago you would be better off  There s a metro and plenty of taxis and lots to do downtown within walking distance  
P => Great Location We stayed here for two nights and had just the one day to explore Chicago  The hotel was perfectly located for seeing everything downtown  Right on the river across from the mag  mile  we loved taking the riverwalk down to the lake  The room was nice enough and we got it for night on priceline so well worth it  Views of the lake or river cost more but our view of the downtown wasnt bad and the room was bright with big windows making up most of one wall  Smelled a little stale but clean otherwise  
P => Great stay On our visit to Chicago we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown within walking distance to most major attractions such as Sears Tower Magnificent Mile GrantMillenium Parks etc  Subway amp bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city   Overall the hotel was very nice clean and at a great location  Was in a safe area  Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play  I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again 
P => Massive Hotel with everything and a great location This is the biggest hotel in Chicago with   floor towers with all the amenities one could wish for  It is well located on the south bank of the Chicago River  minutes walk from Michegan Avenue and the magnificent mile with Millenium Park and Chicagos Navy Pier within walking distance  Rooms are modern beds comfortable and views generally spectacular  Our room had a mini bar and large flat screen TV  but they are that not well lit bedside lamps a standard lamp and desk top reading light struggled to lift the gloominess of lack of a central ceiling light The only serious negative we found were the in house food prices  Two eggs cooked any style   US dollars  Unless laid by the Golden Goose these are very poor value  so breakfast was taken at the Corner Bakery open from  at the ction of East Wacker Drive and Michegan Avenue  at one quarter of the price  
P => Shopping Trip Got a great deal through Trip Advisor site link to Hotels com less than   for  nights  Room was huge view towards Soldier Field and tea and coffee maker in room rare these days outside UK which was replaced each morning  TV was massive  shame no UK channels though  Adequate bath and shower and toiletries replaced daily even if not needed As a business hotel they have  PCs dedicated to online check in so you can print the boarding pass off easily  OK yeh its so vast that it is a little impersonal and on a Saturday night is teeming with people coming for wedding receptions etc or just to eat  But despite that it is efficient if you need help you get it albeit a bit of a wait sometimes and you can check out online too using a stand alone machine  If you stay in the West Tower bit that is recommended  So would definitely recommend  If you get the offer we did snatch their hand off Location isnit out of the way as stated previously   mins from a Giordanos deep dish pizza outlet you must have one and  mins to Wrigley Building and the start of Mag Mile  It overlooks the river if you get a front view and also another  mins and you are in the Loop  Covers all bases in my opinion  
P => This is a great hotel with a great location for sight seeing We got this place for a steal on priceline  a night  It was very centrally located in the loop and was very close to shops restaurants and river  It was a VERY large hotel that obviously accommodates to Chicago tourists  We were there during a Cubs home game and the lobby was FILLED with Cubs fans  The facilities were very clean staff was super nice and the rooms clean our bed was temperpedic  The down sides were anything extra you need at the hotel wifi food or business center is very expensive  You would be better suited to stop at the Walgreens or   a block away to get food and or drinks  Internet was  for mins  They did however have free plane check in computers All in all this was one of our favorite places we have stayed we travel to Chicago every year to visit family  
P => A great place to stay for the price  close to everything This  not be the fanciest hotel youll ever stay at  But its very well kept good service  The beds are nice  The bathroom is nothing special but everything is clean and nice  We are triple A members and got a room for like  a night and FREE parking so that was fantastic  I would definately stay again when we go back to chicago  
P => Fabulous experience with exceptional river view  Moved from neighboring Fairmont to gain internet access  Was expecting a downgrade in terms of personalized service due to the size of the hotel  Not so  The front desk staff addressed me by name my second trip through the lobby after registering  Business Center staff extemely courteous and accommodating  Fax machine needed ink cartridge replacement during my stay so couldnt receive incoming final invoice from the Fairmont and had to go back for it personally The unsightly lobby filled with checked luggage wasa negative  Should offer concealed storage area or late checkoutsearly check ins to avoid accumulation and too many cars parked at the front entrance detracting from the appearance  
P => If your expecting   star    look elsewhere We stayed at the Hyatt over a long weekend  We travel frequently to Chicago and have stayed in many different hotels  This one by far was my least favorite  The rooms need updated  The bathroom is very old school with poor quality towels cracks in the sink and tiles and no fan The customer service was by far the worst part  The lines to check in at the front desk were long the entire time we were there  The Concierge phone line kept ringing and when you went down to ask a question   be prepared for another long line  The luggage storing was also inadequate  The room where you store luggage was full so there was an overflow area they had roped off in the middle of the hotel  Although there was an attendant your luggage and personal belongings were out in the open for everyone to see  The walls are thin and door closings very loud so be prepared to hear this at all hours  The location is close to millenium park and the theater district but you are on the far end of Michigan Ave  We got a great deal thru Hotwire but even with the low rate I would not want to stay here again  I recommend The Affinia or The James  They are worlds apart from this huge hotel where customer service and nice ammenties are lacking    You are just a number here  
P => ent HUGE hotel but not ideal for city visit We got a great deal on Priceline for this place   so we did not have   say in where we stayed  Overall this was a nice place but for tourists who wanted to see the city it was a bit out of the way  It was also huge and had lots of sections  They were doing construction on the west tower i think  Its really not a  star hotel  The service was ent  We stopped into the atrium for breakfast and it was around  for pancakes and  for a buffet   no thanks The rooms were really nice and large  
P => No big complaints We stayed here for a single night on Saturday ust th  The room was  including tax through Priceline which I thought was a good value  Check in was a breeze and we received a free upgrade from a standard double to a standard King  The room worked out fine although I agree with the earlier comment that the bathroom needed a fan  I found that a bit odd for a major chain hotel The facility is massive which can make it seem rather impersonal but the first floor bar was jam packed very late Saturday night  Rather than use the valet parking we used the Millenium Garage a few block south of the hotel  It was  for the day to park I would stay here again for the price  
P => Upket barracks This is an accommodation factory  Efficient impersonal cost controlled  The individual staff were fine but the place has no other attractions  The best example is the notice on the mini bar  If you put anything in it to cool they will charge you  for the violation and the cleaner will throw it out anyway  Nice The room was fine and comfortable it looks like they refurbished fairly recently  The conference rooms were dungeons too far below ground to get a cell signal On the other hand its a very central location  
P => One of the best High Class Hotels nice Seeview Tropical at the Lounge best Steaks in Town 
P => Very nice hotel with great location Stayed at the Hyatt while doing some site seeing  The room was large and comfortable  The only thing I didnt like was there is no fan in the bathroom  We had a few mainly of the adjacent building but we could see a little of the Chicago River and the Michigan Avenue Bridge  The location is definitely the best part of the hotel  You are minutes from many of Chicagos downtown attractions  We saw everything we wanted to see and never needed to use public transportation  As stated before the walls are quite thin but my friend brought earplugs with so I never had a problem  The worst thing about the hotel was the elevator situation  We were on a higher floor and there were times we had to wait quite a while for an elevator  But all in all I would say I had a good experience and would stay here again  
P => Good deal My husband and I spent  nights in Hyatt Regency Chicago and I thought it was not bad  I like the set up of the lobby fountain and restaurant on the st floor  Our front desk lady and the concierge were very helpful  Dont open andor remove anything in the mini bar unless you really really need it  A can of pepsi can cost you about   We paid night through Priceline    the actual price for the room is around night  The room setup is a little weird not a perfect square nor rectangle a big TV on a side desk  chair amp a flimsy door connected to the other room  Our room was in the corner of th floor facing wacker street  Were glad we didnt have neighbor until the last night bc they were gossiping the whole night  Everything they said I heard it  I wish the walls werent that thin The staffs were very helpful we didnt need them to clean our room since we got up pretty late and I wasnt comfortable to have someone else in the bedroom while we were getting ready  We didnt take our car since the parking fee is night  Thank God for iPhone it costs day to get internet access in the hotel room  We brought breakfast food from home so we didnt have to go out for that  There is Walgreen and a grocery store named Bockwinkel if I am not mistaken located on the street behind the hotel  We didnt get to go there but we saw it and it looks like they have anything you need  Navy Pier and Millennium park are walking distance  Overall it was a nice stay  Definitely use Priceline or similar websites to get lower price  
P => Excellent Hotel in downtown Chicago I spent  nights at Hyatt Regency in ust  I was there for a conference in the hotel  Very good location everything is in walking distance the foundation tour by boat the double k tour bus the Sears Tower now called Willis Tower the Millennium Park etc  I just need to walk across the road down  level to find the ticket booth and got on the boat  It called Chicago first lady  The tour took about  hours  The thing I like is that the hotel concierge provided you all the information you need for anything in Chicago downtown or uptown  They gave you all ready printed information sheet of address bus number or what train or s simple map etc  When I arrived there was something wrong with our booking but the staff were really nice and attentive  It did take a long time before my problem was fixed but I was pleased with the attitude of the check in counter staff  The room is excellent  It has big TV Ipod dock safe box the pressing equipment  The bathroom is a bit worn out and the bathtub is too small at least in my opinion  Further the shower is stuck to the wall so I didnt enjoy the shower very much  But it is just a minor  The room is clean  The house keeping staff is nice and helpful  However there was a small accident to me during my stay  On the day I had to make my presentation they couldnt find out where my suit was  It was supposed to arrive AM but I waited till  and had to leave without wearing any suit  It was really annoying in the beginning  Finally the service manager came up to my room offered apology as they outsourced the laundry service and that company failed to deliver on time  They offered to charge me nothing for the laundry with sincere apology  I think it is an acceptable attitude  But I do hope the hotel will improve this part of the service  We had breakfast at Bistro   It cost  tax included but without gratuity  It was great with variety choices  I often woke up early and spent an hour for my breakfast  I felt great with full energy during the day The restaurant at the st level is good too  It is not too expensive comparing to similar hotel elsewhere  The hotel also has Starbucks at first level where they sell some sorts of sandwiches cookies fruits  It is where you can save some cash when you are hungry at late hour and dont want to spend big cash on room service order of a superb  Sharing with some other reviews I saw it didnt have a pool which it should have had one  The valet parking is quite expensive at  per night but the boys are really nice and gentle  The only one thing I most dislike about the hotel is it was often too crowded at the lobby and the check in counters and the concierge counters so most of the time I had to wait for a long time when I wanted to ask anything or to communicate a problem with the front manager  Or perhaps it was those days with several conferences that resulted in over crowded inside the hotel  You can imagine the lobby as like a hyperket with a special promotion campaign and full of people talking chanting and waiving to have a big discount  
P => The best value we found in Chicago We found a great internet special for the Hyatt Regency in Chicago at  nt plus tax  This hotel is within walking distance of virtually every major attraction in Chicago  The rooms are large clean and well appointed  The staff is pleasant and helpful  We had a great view of the river  We visit Chicago regularly and will definitely be back at the Hyatt  
P =>  Star Service I cant say enough good things about the staff at this hotel  EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE from bellhop at curb to checkin to conciarge the bellhop inside to resturant staff to checkout went above and beyond what I would consider good service  The location is of course excellent  My room was upgraded to a river view  I was disappointed to find that some previous occupant had smoked in the room    leaving a that stale smoke odor  The odor was most noticable after taking a shower  I told the staff upon leaving and they said they would clean it for the next person  I was also VERY annoyed that one couldnt use the minibar as a mini fridge for ones own stuff  It contained a weight sensor    if you removed anything you would be charged  If you added anything you would be charged   I didnt open the door and used the ice bucket as a cooler for a couple of sodas  Grump grump     This ranks right up there with charging for high speed internet access which I believe they also do    I was traveling without a laptop on my list of pet hotel peeves  My room included the contential breakfast which was quite a spread  For a bit more one could upgrade to a hot breakfast that included smoked salmon cold of course  I passed on the hot breakfast knowing I was going out for a Chicago stuffed pizza for lunch  I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others  
P => What are you talking about I honestly do not know what these people are complaining about  I have stayed at this hotel three times now and have always gotten good service and a clean comfortable room and I use Priceline Check in was a super speedy breeze be all of  minutes since there was no one in line and I was checking in about  pm  This is a huge convention hotel so there will be lots of people and yes like a typical hotel the bar and resteraunt will be over priced but you know what forget those plays Go to the neighborhoods and chow down with the locals  Now after checking in I boogied up to my room  Like my two other rooms it was spacious with slightly more then a sliver view of the river facing east and a view of the fire dept  down on the street and various buildings  I found the room generally clean and well kept  There were no scuff ks burn holes and what not  My only gripe is the bath soaps they use  They are too perfumey and gave me a very bad headache  I had to run to the grocery store to grab some of my regular bath soap  But other then that I found this another great stay just like the rest  So those bad reviews take with a small grain of salt cause they are most likely ocd anal folk who nit pick everything  
P => Prime Location cheap prices updated rooms excellent value I used priceline com to book my room here and was shocked with how nice the roomhotel was for  per night on a weekend in ustErin at the front desk put me in a corner room on the th floor room  which gave me a view of the river and a view of Navy Pier and the lakeWhile I agree that the walls are thin I went to bed early by chicago standards at midnight and had absolutely no problem with noise Elevators are very quick too I read in a previous review not to park here because of a day fee so instead I drove to Midway Airport and parked economy for day with a free shuttle to the terminal where I then took the Orange Line CTA into the loop for the hotel  Train rides are   one way and very easy to figure out  The Hyatt was only  quick blocks from the train stop Bell desk kept my bag after checkout for me coffee was available in my room ac worked great beds comfy and the pillows were incredibleContemporary updated design small room was plenty large enough for  people  Since I was traveling alone I gave the front desk the freedom to put me in a room with any kind of bed  I received a room with a queen bed and a magnificent view all for nightThere are several restaurants in this hotel from Bistro  to Stetsons steakhouse to an Irish pub and another sandwich place  Also the bar called BIG also serves food until midnight which I was happy to see as not many restaurants were open at midnight on Michigan Ave  I ordered the quotpizza of the dayquot which was a pepperoni and sausage  It was hot tasty and prompt to our table and large enough to share with  people Friendly helpful convenient hotel in the best location in the loop  Thumbs up 
P => Waaaay Overpriced For What It Is I arrived at Hyatt Regency Chicago to find that they had overbooked  They therefore paid for two nights accommodation at the Westin before I came back to the Hyatt for three nights  The problem with that from the Hyatts perspective is that Westin is much more contemporary stylish price effective and the staff are friendlier  So on the comparison Hyatt would have been better to keep me for the whole five nights as I had originally bookedAnyway the Hyatt Regency has a few problems  The rooms look and feel as though they are from the s  The shower head in my room was water and grime stained where it had been in use for so long  The toilet was also stained from years of use  Another problem was an over zealous group of cleaners  They were desperately trying to kick you out of your room every morning so they could clean and seemingly didnt understand when you told them to come back later on  Unless you stay on the top floors you also need to be prepared to wait for long periods of time for the lifts as they are almost certain to be full by the time they reach you  This can honestly result in a  minute wait  The staff werent as friendly as at Westin either and the selection of foods in the restaurant werent as nice Overall I think you should save your money and go to another hotel  This one is in a good location but has too much that is wrong with it to encourage anyone to stay there  
P => Great Hotel Great View of the Chicago River and the Magnificent Mile  It was very conveniently located and within walking distance of the River Walk and Magnificent Mile  
P => Average hotel in above average location Stayed at the Hyatt for a weekend get away and was satisfied with the experience  The Hyatt has to be one of the biggest hotels in Chicago with  arate towers each over  stories tall  This is not a boutique or personal service hotel  The hotel lobby is a two story atrium that seems to be busy at all hours more like an airport terminal than anything  Despite the size the place seems to run pretty well  There were no problems with check in or baggage  We were offered a newly remodled room with less of a view or an older room with a better view  We took the newer and made a good choice  The furnishings were fresh and modern with dark woods leather chair flat panel TV modern art and new carpet  The entire floor was airy and bright not the sort of oon carpet and cookie cutter paintings you might expect  On the down side the walls are a little thin and the hallways can be loud  We were stationed at the end of one of the H shaped hallways so noise wasnt a problem  It might be if you get a room on the main hallway or near the elevators  The elevators are what you expect in a hotel of this size crowded and slow  There wasnt any real down side but nothing spectacular either  We didnt really stay in the hotel other than to sleep but we did have a drink at the quotBig Barquot in the second floor atrium  It is indeed big  We were on one of the concierge floors which entitled you to access to the th floor lounge  This had snacks and light meals during the day  We visited several times and mainly refueled with soft drinks or juice  The snacks and meals werent our speed since the place was crowded and we didnt go to Chicago to eat bagels in the hotel  One suprise plus was the view even though our room wasnt supposed to have much of a view  We looked out onto the Michigan Ave  bridge and the Wrigley Building across the river  It was great to look out the window at all hours  Thats really the best part of this property Its steps away from both the Michigan Ave  shopping areas as well as the Loop and Millennium Park  You really dont need a car to get to either area  The overall impression is that this is a good hotel but not so good that youll want to stay on the property your entire trip  
P => gorgeous rooms friendly staff we stayed here for a couple nights while we played tourist in downtown chicago  nabbed a sweet deal on hotwire for our stay this hyatt is in a great area just a couple blocks north of millennium park location of the famous quotbeanquot  we were able to walk all around the river get to the L and bus lines easily and enjoyed the hustle amp bustle around the hotel very friendly amp professional front desk staff the room and bathroom are beautiful  the king bed was comfy with lots of pillows  comfortable room temperature  only thing was we were located right next to the elevator which was a bit noisy in the mornings  im sure you can request to be further down the hallway  
P => Great Hotel Great Deal Excellent Hotel for the price  Do not stay there for more than night  But great location good service and staff was excellent They were very helpful including the concierge  Yes parking is a bit of a hassle cause of   for  hrs  But honestly no need for a rental car if you you stay there due to its proximity of everything  People have complained about little things here on tripadvisor but come on guys you cant ask for everything you want  If thats the case then stay home  lolTip Go to Walgreens and get a variety pack of granola bars for breakfastStarbucks in the lobby of the hotel is best for coffee and eat your granola bar in the grand atrium lobby Since you dont need rental just take the Chicago Trolley amp Double ker tour for sightseeing If you ide to take the quotELquot train into downtown from midway make sure you have exact change    per person  best mode of transportation from Midway Overall Chicago is a great city  You cannot get bored Enjoy amp stop complaining 
P => Way underrated This is a very nice and perfectly located hotel  I arrived to find I had been booked twice and the problem was taken care of immediately  My colleague requested lake view but all that was left was quotpartial lake viewquot which turned out to be  be   degree of lake view   dont bother I made no special requests and ended up with a really lovely city view facing north of the river and on the fifth floor  My colleagues double room was ok but my king room was much better due to the nicer layout the bed is facing the window with plenty of room for the sofa and chair and nice desk area  One tip get on the elevator on the first floor not the second floor where you register  Otherwise you will have to wait awhile if the hotel is full The best thing about this hotel was the price I got it through Priceline at a price so low Im embarrassed to put it here  Lets just say its got to be the deal of the city by a long shot  Ive been given to understand that locals have discovered the low price and are staying there themselves  Given the low low price I have to say to all of the negative reviewers give it a rest 
P => Hyatt Regency We booked this a few days in advance on priceline and got a great deal  This hotel was great the staff was nice the location was good and the rooms were great  The hotel is within walking distance of Navy Pier and other sites  There are a few restaurants in the hotel but we did not eat at any of them  Our room was comfortable quiet and had a view of the river  
P => Location was great and perfect for our sightseeing trip  My teenage boys  and  and I stayed for  nights at the Hyatt  We had no trouble checking in but we did see that the front desk at the east tower was very busy we did check in at the west tower    no lines and our room was just fine  We had a room with two double beds  The location was wonderful  We ate deep dish pizza at Giordanos around the corner and there is a great grocery store just down the street where we purchased bagels cream cheese and croissants for breakfast  They also have a good selection of fruit and pre made food  Good selection of wine and when I called room service for a cork screw they were up within minutes  My boys heated up pizza in the microwaves in the lobby and there is a Starbucks for coffee  I had a room at the end of a hall and did hear some slight noise in the morning but nothing I couldnt live with  We walked to the Navy Pier the Willis formerly Sears Tower and the Mile  We also took a water taxi to the Field Museum  Checkout was quick  My bathroom sink drained slow and I informed the front desk upon checking out I figured no one had told them  
P => Great hotel in a fantastic location Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of  a night  The BF and I were amazed when we got there  the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous A nice upscale downtown feel and super comfy beds  We had a fabulous view from the th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times  Seriously  We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay  which was fine with us  The hotel consists mainly of  towers and is like a huge sprawling city inside  But we werent there to stay in the hotel room the entire time   we like to get out and explore as much as possible  The location was fantastic  Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown  We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab  I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river the entrance is right across from the hotel  we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too  Dont park your car here if you dont need to  its very expensive  Park downtown or ditch the rental car  you wont need it anyway you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab  Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel 
P => Large Convention Hotel in Need of Upgrade The Hyatt Regency is a large convention style hotel that is located just off of Michigan Avenue in the midst of downtown Chicago The hotel is huge and there a multiple towers within the hotel complex  The first floor of the hotel has an open casual restaurant and some sitting areas while the lobby is on the second floor  A bar called Big is on the second floor and had a neat vibe The room was ent  The bathroom was not grand or large but efficient  The bed was comfortable and was in the middle of the room with a large desk area behind it  The TV is HD  Large windows showed a nice view of the lake from my room  There was slight problem with the air conditioning and it did not keep the room cool enough most of the stay  The staff was great all around  Did not eat at the restaurants as there are amazing choices in downtown Chicago a great meal at Shaw s Crab House The workout facility was efficient and the machines seemed to be fairly new and in working order Overall the hotel is getting old and is need of some upgrading  There are some better choices in the area like the Fairmont around the corner but if you can get a good price we paid an average of about  per night or have a convention in the hotel it is fine  
P => Wont be my first choice for any future stays in the city The Hyatt Regency is in an excellent location with great views of the river and the city but the enormous size of the hotel makes the lobby feel more like an airport terminal and the rooms are not at all soundproof making a good night sleep quite difficult  
P => Upgrade to the Club Level Our family  adults  teens stayed at the Hyatt for three nights  This was a great hotel for our purposes as it was convenient to Millennium Park Navy Pier the Miracle Mile we even walked to the Aquarium the Planetarium and the Field Museum  We ate at a great pizza restaurant Chicago deep dish called Giordanos which was only a four minute walk from the hotel  We were able to get a good deal found it on TravelZoo at  a night which included a room on the club level  floors which you can only reach with a special elevator key  This provided us with a complimentary breakfast snacks and drinks throughout the day honor bar and very nice munching food pate special crackers fruit antipasto etc from  to  and then desserts from  to   All of the food was top notch including capers and smoked salmon for breakfast and always fresh fruit granola etc  There was also free internet in the business room  Another excellent perk with our room was our tremendous view of the Chicago River Lake Michigan Navy Pier  We had a perfect view of the Navy Pier fireworks on Wednesday night  Our rate also included parking normally  a night  Our room had two queen beds and was attractively furnished with plenty of room  Our bathroom was large but seemed a bit outdated  The hallway was narrow and in need of sprucing however we spent very little time in the hallway  The staff was very kind and helpful  We had a small issue with the honor bar we had put some leftover pizza in the frig and apparently you are charged by weight so we had a  bill for shifting things around  The person at the check out was more than gracious and worked out the problem for us in a kind and respectful manner All in all this hotel was a great place for our family to stay in Chicago  
P => Great quiet location in downtown Chicago I got a great deal on Priceline for a room at the Hyatt  This hotel is nicely located in Downtown Chicago  It is a  minute walk to the Navy pier and only a  minute walk to many great resturants  The hotel offers all the luxeries but we carried our own bags and parked in the ramp  blocks away to save money  This hotel charges  for overnight in and out valet parking but I paid less than  to park just  short blocks away  They do have a nice area to park temporarily and unload in front of the hotel  Our room was quiet and comfortable  It shows minor wear and is smaller but for the location and price we paid we were thrilled  We did not try any of their services but the exercise room  
P => Great Location Good Service with Some Small Housekeeping Problems I moved into the Hyatt during the last two days of a conference I was attending and then stayed an additional  days for vacation  The location is on the south bank of the Chicago River and two blocks east of Michigan Avenue  Four blocks from the loop and easy walking distance to Millennium Park and the north side of downtown  One of the confusing things about that area of town is that below street level is a whole nother street level where some buses run and where you have to go down to cross the bridge to the north side if you dont want to walk to Michigan  Had breakfast every morning at the Corner Bakery on Michigan and Wacker as cheaper than the hotel restaurant although in the hotel lobby is a counter service coffee bar if all you want is a pastry and coffee  We didnt eat at any of the restaurants or called for room service If you already have a reservation self service check in is possible which speeded up our check in process quite a bit  Unfortunately you cant specify additional criteria than what is in your original reservation so we ended up in a non smoking room on the th floor facing an office building  View rooms are more expensive The rooms are ently appointed but with two full size beds a little tight for two people with a person sitting at the desk the other person cant get around the bed  Only two dresser draws and night stand drawer as the other under counter space was taken up by mini fridge and computerkeyboard  If youre the kind of person that unpacks into the dresser you wont have a lot of drawer space  Lots of pillows including a relatively thin bolster  Wi fi access is available for day completely outrageous  The bathroom is good sized and yes there is a public restroom toilet another reviewer noted that as a negative   I just found it a little unusual  Water pressure was OK not great but the shower curtain was on one of those bent rods so plenty of room to take a shower Housekeeping was generally good but a little inconsistent  Glasses were taken and not replaced twice but when called housekeeing brought replacement glasses within  minutes  Each day the bed was made slightly differently with a different number and location of pillows  First night we were there we noticed one of the headboard lights didnt work  Electrician was in the room  minutes after I called and then figured it might be a circuit breaker  Light came on about  minutes after he left to check the breaker  Other than that everything worked as expected  Good AC We had several questions for the concierge over the course of our stay  All were answered accurately but with various degrees of helpful attitude  When we asked a bus question of the desk staff one night as the concierge closes at  we were given a wrong answer that made for extra walking the next day  Self service checkout was easy and although the system was a little pokey still much quicker than waiting in line to check out in person Altogether a pleasant stay in a very convenient location  I was able to book the room through Priceline for night and for that price it was an excellent excellent value  
P => Nice Convenient Hotel I cant comment on rates since I receive a discounted conference rate  The hotel is older but well updated  The walls do seem rather thin as I could hear people talking but they were also speaking rather loudly  If you dont mind walking you can easily go to Navy Pier and reach the lakefont  The El Train is about a  minute walk and I walk rather fast  The rooms are very nice and the staff is very friendly  A walk to all the shops on Michagan Avenue is about   minutes  I was in the East Tower with a view to the east on the th floor  I could see the river and the lake  The only frustrating thing was the wireless internet  It costs   per day and seemed to cut out frequently  I would recommend this hotel however  
P => Great stay on th of y weekend I live in the Chicago suburbs  We ided to use Hyatt points to stay downtown rather than dealing with traffic after the fireworks and taste of Chicago crowds driving back  Our room was on the nd floor the view of the river lake and Navy Pier was beautiful  The bed was comfortable the room was clean and the bathroom had a nice shower and soaking tub  The hotel is in a good location you can walk to the lakefront Pier or Melinium Park in around  minutes  The riverfront paths are right across the street and Michigan Ave is about a block away  The walls seemed a little thin but it didnt really bother us  Front desk staff was great  I would stay here again  
P => Beautiful Hotel With the exception of some billing issues and the fact that this hotel is notorious for overbooking we had a lovely stay The hotel is huge  Two towers and about  rooms  We had approx   people in our group and we were spread out amongst the two towers  There were people in our group I didnt see again until it was time to check out   We had a buffet style breakfast in a lovely restaurant on the first floor of one of the towers the food was excellent  The hotel staff was polite and knowledgeable  We stayed in room   The room was stunning we could see Lake Michigan from the window in the hallway  The view in our room was of the courtyard area  
P => Club level is great I recently stayed at the Hyatt with my  children age  and   We were upgraded to Club level access with Jr Suite  Our room was a great size  One King size bed with a couches and a side chair  We had  large flat screen tvs and a mini fridge  The only down fall was that we only had a shower with the amount of walking we did a soak in a tub would have been niceThe club level access was nice free internet connection a variety of newspapers a nice continental breakfast and a nice evening reception  Many days we just had a large lunch and ate at the reception for dinner veggie and dip breads cheese hummus fruit  All during the day they had nice cookies and later at night great pies and cheesecake We liked the location  It was very central to what we wanted to do  It is centrally located to the Pier GrantMillinium Park and the Miracle Mile We arrrived at the hotel at  noon and tried to check in our room wasnt ready but the hotel took care of our luggage and said they would call us when it was ready  Not really necessary as we were off to the taste of Chicago  When we got back our room was ready and our luggage brought up This is a large hotel but we enjoyed it alot  The club access or the clubhouse as my kids called it was nice you could meet other travellers and gave a nice area to relax in We would definitely go back to the Hyatt 
P => The Hotel exceeded our expectations My husband amp I live in Michigan and wanted a quick inexpensive get away to Chicago  So I started with bidding on priceline for  star hotel room in the Grant park area for  per night  To my surprise priceline accepted my bid at Hyatt Regency  The Hyatt has done a good job at keeping the hotel looking quotmodernquot and there is plenty of dining options inside the HUGE complex  The room was clean amp the bed was very comfortable  The bath room showed the age of the hotel the most   but it was clean too  I would have given a  overall rating but they gave us a room on the th floor with a view of an office building  However considering we paid  rack price   we really cant complain  Oh yeah the workout facility is amazing and its in walking distance of all the hot spots  
P => Your satisfaction will depend on how much you paid We booked this hotel through on Hotwire and paid   For  this is a great hotel  After we got this hotel I looked up the rate on the hotels website and was quoted   This hotel is not worth   A number of people have complained about the location of the hotel  There is no perfect Chicago location for a hotel  It really depends on what you want to do while you are in Chicago  The hotel is not actually located on the Magnificient Mile but is very close to the south end of it where Wacker Dr hits Michigan  It is literally a five minute walk from the hotel to the start of the Magnificient Mile  As is typical for any hotel in the Magnificient Mile area it is not very convenient to the El  You will have to walk several blocks to any El station  If this is important to you you should stay in the Loop area  It is one of the closest hotels to Navy Pier and within walking distance about  minutes unlike some hotels located on the north end of the Magnificient Mile area  My advice is to figure out what you want to do while you are in Chicago and then pick your hotel  The room itself is a typical chain hotel room  It was clean but nothing special and not extremely large or small  There was a nice flat screen tv in the room  The bathroom had a curved shower curtain bar and a nice water massage shower head  The toilet could have used an update  It looked like a toilet you would find in a high school bathroom  One other drawback is parking is  per night unless you want to find a close by garage park it yourself and save a few bucks  Ultimately if you can get a good deal at this place you will enjoy your stay  If you pay the rack rate this hotel is not good enough to justify its high price and you will come away unsatisfied 
P => Convenience and comfort  at a price I wouldnt have stayed here if my employer wasnt paying but it was a great place to stay  The location is ideal and there are restaurants in the Hyatt but hundreds of nearby eateries at more affordable prices  The room was very comfortable with lots of extra pillows a desk and comfy chair  The staff is very friendly but be prepared with a gratuity  the support staff seem to expect it  
P => This hotel is nice I booked this hotel through Hotwire   with taxes and fees  We felt it was a great deal for the money  The lobby was large attractive and impressive  It was typically busy for a large popular big city hotel but the lobby is so large that there is still room to move around  I didnt use any of the amenities like the restaurants or bars at the hotel as I usually dont when Im staying in a place like downtown Chicago  The check in was pleasant  I asked them for a room with double beds and was given that  We had no problems with the room  It had a large HDtv  I lined a room upgrade offer  Our room was at the end of a hall and there was a building across our room as one might expect and we could also see the Chicago River  As for people complaining about high prices at hotel restaurants concessions and bars I dont think I have ever seen a hotel with quotcheapquot restaurants concessions and bars  It is overpriced for convienence like anything else  That is one reason I typically dont use those services besides the fact that it is pretty boring just sit in a hotel when you are in downtown Chicago  
P => Nice place if you have a discounted rated  We stayed here for our anniversary and had an amazing weekend  The room was a bit dated and it shared a wall with the elevator shaft but overall it wasnt bad  We didnt really notice the elevators much and the view looking towards the Hancock Building and the Chicago River across the street made up for the minor inconvenience  The room was clean but not that impressive  The location is fantastic as its only a couple blocks from Michigan Ave  and close to Navy Pier  We were able to shop and enjoy walking around with little trouble  Parking is expensive but it is a downtown hotel so that shouldnt surprise anybody  Wireless internet was also  for hrs which was a bit dissapointing  I would recommend this hotel for people looking to stay downtown but I would only stay here if you are able to get a discounted rate  We used Priceline and that is the only way I would stay here again  We really cant complain about our stay and we had a great weekend but Im not sure this is a star hotel  
P => A perfect hotel for a memorable trip with our grandchildren We traveled to Chicago on the train with our two grandsons ages  and  for a three day stay in the city  We were somewhat skeptical of our Hyatt Regency reservation after reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor  We were pleased as we entered the hotel and met friendly employees at the door the front desk and throughout the hotel  We were fortunate to book a room through Travelzoo offering an upgrade to the Regency Club located on floors   of the West Tower  Our room was on the th floor and had a Lake view so our grandsons could see the fireworks at Navy Pier  The Club room is also located on that floor and offers complimentary beverages snacks breakfast food desserts   something all day long  This was a big hit for our grandsons and definitely was a plus for our food budget  The people in the Club were very accomodating and friendly with the children  They also offer free internet service in the club area  As we checked out the boys asked if we could return someday   we would be happy to do so and would always want to be on the Regency Club Level of this conveniently located hotel  
P => Ridiculous Fees Great Location Somewhat Dated   for high speed Internet at a hotel in this day and age is absolutely absurd  Add on top of that   small bottles of water in the main dining area and very high food prices and the quotvaluequot of this hotel really gets diminished  If I had not booked this for night through hotwire I would not have stayed here  While the people and service are absolutely top notch this is a HUGE convention style hotel that has been here since the s and is starting to show its age  If you can get a great rate like I did it is worth it but if you are looking at  per night I would definitely look somewhere else  On top of that my room  was next to the service elevator which I could hear ALL NIGHT  It sounded like someone was rolling a metal cart back and forth right behind the headboard of the bed     I couldnt sleep at all  
P => Very large impressive hotel incredible view from the room We stayed in this hotel in ember for a leisure trip  The hotel is very contemporary public areas area very expansive and you can almost get lost Our room was beautiful very contemporary style and incredible views that looked toward lake Michigan  Service was excellent staff always saying hi and asking if there was anything we needed  We payed  through a discount website so it was a greaat deal fro Chicago in this location in a hotel with these ammenities this has Would deffinetly stay here again 
P => Not Too Shabby My wife and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our anniversary  The staff were very very friendly and courteous  They gave us a quiet corner room with a view after we mentioned the reason for our trip  The room was clean and a good deal for the price we named our own price on Priceline  Location was excellent close to a few places to eat a short walk to the el train and a short drive to the museum campus  The only negatives I can think of are the additional fee for parking  about average in Chicago and the fact that there wasnt a free breakfast in the morning  It made for a pleasant weekend trip in the big city  
P => Stay only if you get a good rate We stayed at the Hyatt for  days in early e  The hotel is really big   two large towers  Overall it was good but wouldn t say it was  star like Hotwire said  We got a good price so I was happy but there were a few things we weren t thrilled about  The walls seemed thin and it didn t help there was a very young family beside us with crying children  Internet is very expensive  per day which was a turn off to just check personal emails  There isnt a pool which was really disappointing for me  I found the cleaning staff and front desk really pleasant  There wasn t a single person in the hotel that when asked couldn t answer our questions  Yes I d recommend the hotel if you got it for less than  per night  
P => Great location This hotel is a short distance from Union Station and right on the river  We got a great deal from Hotwire and were very pleased with the value  We had a simple and quick check in at noon and were given a clean and spacious room  Large screen HD TV was a nice bonus  
P => Not impressed at all I visited Chicago in   and stayed at this hotel for a few nights  I expected a great service excellent maintenance and comfort from the hotel of this calibre but found the room service to be just okay  We only ordered breakfast from the hotel once but the prices were not worth it  The buffet breakfast just outside the hotel gave us an extensive menu for half the price  We noticed that they had not changed our bedsheets after our first night    they did after the second night but made us apprehensive whether they would or not for the remaining nights  My friend and I were surprised that they did not use plastic bags for either the washroom waste basket or the one in the room    that is simply unhygienic  The room was comfortable but the tv had some issues  The thermostat was also not very efficient and we had to keep making it cooler  The washroom needed upgrading and the mirror had permanent stains on it  We could also hear people walking thru the halls which made the room feel less private  There was a convention going on in the hotel as well and it was overtly crowded and noisy whether the downstairs lobby or the inside restaurants  There was always a long line up for everything  If it were not the discount i was getting I would not have stayed here  On the plus side we had an excellent view of the Lake Michigan from our windows but most hotels in the area can provide that  The place is very expensive for the service I got and internet prices were also very high  i think vs  Boing  A tip on local attractionsAlthough I advise using the local transportation for sightseeing and getting to and from the airport the bus service staff is not as good as one would expect from a tourist city  I used the cab service for nearby areas and it turned out to be much less painful  Make sure you do some research in regards to the public transportation before hand  The hotel is too far from everything so be prepared to walk a lot from here to any of the locations  
P => Helpful staff ent sized rooms what view Came for a conference and stayed a couple extra nights for some fun in the Windy City  Conference was at the Hyatt and we had considered staying elsewhere for the fun part but ided it would be too much of a hassle  Glad we didnt  The room was a good size with a seating area desk area and large quot flat screen  The hotel was always hopping     hour coffeesnack stand downstairs for late night munchies  Make sure to ask for a room in the main building not the West Tower though  
P => Overpriced airport like hotel I am stunned that this hotel is rated as four stars on Trip Advisor  Simply because a hotel charges an arm and a leg for a room does not make it four stars  I stayed here for two nights not because of my ision but those who were traveling with me  To start we spent  minutes in the lobby waiting to check in  The lobby is a very expansive atrium that reminds me of an airport ticketing hall  Guests were corralled through roped lines to check in at one of  open stations out of about  that were at the desk  The room is loud and packed with people   not a good way to start a quotrelaxingquot trip We stayed in the West tower  I cannot complain about the room but also dont have anything great to say about it  It was about the size one would expect in a Chicago hotel but I have seen better quality of furniture and materials in a HI Express  For the price you can do much better in the city I had no issues during my stay until leaving  We called ahead to have our car which was parked valet brought around to the front  We were told it would be about  minutes  This was fine as I understand they have a lot of people in the hotel and a lot of cars to move  However after going downstairs  minutes later and not finding our car we were a bit miffed  We asked the valet if it was coming and he said yes they were just behind  After waiting another  minutes we asked again and he had no record of the car being requested  They managed to get the car about  minutes later   more than an hour after being initially called I think the valet service speaks to a lack of staffing at an enormous hotel biggest in Chicago  If you are looking for a hotel where you feel like herded cattle   this is it  If you want a relaxing trip I would suggest looking elsewhere  Probably somewhere smaller  
P => Soulless busy hotel just about accceptable   in  Here for a conference work paying the bill  Yet another soulless frayed large American city centre hotel  Rooms comfortable enough but all the usual problems namely long queues at front desk charming but often clueless staff and an annoying sprawling layout which means that if you forget something in your room popping back to get it is a major chore  The gym a miserable affair is so far from the rooms it might as well be in another state and one lunchtime it took half an hour to get a table for food even though there were plenty of free ones available  That said the location is pretty good Stetsons Restaurant is actually pretty good and room rates are quite reasonable  But no one here is trying really hard  
P => Great Enormous Hotel I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel in    I had read the hundreds of reviews on this site and was scared of what I would find  As with any hotel some people love it and some people hate it  I was there for a conference and work payed the full bill   First off the hotel is enormous  Two big towers with a massive atrium for a lobby  The rooms are completely removed from the lobby so there was no noise in the bedroom from the atrium  For check in I only had to wait for  people ahead of me to complete their check ins  Approx  minutes  I had a th floor room so never experienced any long elevator rides  My room was not one of the ones right at the elevator lobby so it was dead silent   The room was great big tv soft bed nice deskworkspace area  My only real complaints are  the bathroom lighting  So very dark just  weak flourescent bulb   the thin walls Ive stayed in a lot of hotels for work this one was odd I could hear conversations      and other sounds yep those ones     so clearly  Usually you can make out mumbles etc      but in this one I could hear full sentences at normal volume  Odd But all said I loved the hotel and especially its location  Its so close to everything  Id stay here again in a heartbeat 
P => A whack hotel on Wacker Drive Pros Good location    close to the major sites transit shopping restaurants etc  Nice staff    they are nice to you although the quotjobquot isnt really getting done see belowCons  Dirty room    The standard of cleanliness we experienced was very low random hair bunches in the bathroom floor corners spots and stains on the walls ks of some kind on the pillow etc    More disgusting stuff    The baby blanket they provided with the crib smelled of urine  It was clear that it had not been laundered since the last child used it and urinated on it  The baby crib sheets also smelled of urine so we got replacements  We disinfected the urine stained baby crib mattress ourselves   No hot water in our room    We complained  A nice helpful guy from quotengineering came by and fixed it    for the night  By the next morning there was no hot water again  We had to run the water for  minutes for hot water to come through   Mini fridge didnt work    They were nice enough to give a complimentary mini fridge since we had a baby  Unfortunately it didnt cool very well probably not lower than F which isnt good enough for storing milk  I asked for a replacement mini fridge but didnt let them take away the first because    based on my experience thus far in the hotel    I doubted the second one would work  Of course the second one didnt work at all  Good thing we kept the semi working first one   Dilapidated facilities and room    Regarding the sorry state of the hotels facilities shown in other reviewers photos we experienced this too  There isnt a lot of care in this hotel and it really shows  The hotel is aware of all of the problems    the front desk fielded all of our complaints  However they never did anything to compensate for them  They said they would take care of it right away but any attempt to fix an issue didnt work    replacing one broken fridge with another broken fridge isnt helpful  Neither is fixing the hot water for just one night  I dont understand why the Hyatt would allow their brand to be associated with this hotel  Are they repositioning the brand to be a  star classWe got the room for a bid of night on a well known bidding site but after all the issues I wouldnt consider this much of a quotdealquot  If you can afford to stay at another hotel I would strongly recommend that you do so  I wouldnt even stay here if I were attending a conference in this hotel  The Swissotel is connected by underground passageway the Hotel Monaco and The Fairmont are close by  There are many hotels within walking distance that would be better places to stay  I wont bid on a   hotel in the Loop area on that bidding site given my experience here  Its just not worth the risk of getting this hotel  
P => No complaints Good location clean friendly and helpful staff When my boyfriend and I first arrived at the hotel the size of the hotel lobby and the crowds seemed a bit overwhelming  However we quickly figured out where we needed to go checked in using the automatic machines you can check in with staff also and were in our room within minutes  We booked on priceline and managed to get  a night for our room We got no special views from our standard room and the room lacked wi fi but we thought it was a fantastic deal given the location and reputation of the Hyatt  p s  if you stay at this hotel you can park at the Millenium Park garage for  per  hour period MUCH cheaper than what the Hyatt charges 
P => Meets many needs I stayed at this hotel because it was the host hotel for my meeting  This hotel is very large with the usual chic Hyatt look  I arrived mid morning and was pleased to have a room ready for me before regular check in time  There are many floors of the hotel so it can take a while to get to your floor because of other peoples stops on the elevator  The inside of the room was pretty spacious and sleekly orated  The desk space was very nice and the tv was larger than usual  This hotel is very conducive to fitness  There are lots of walkable places blocks away from the hotel but the gym is awesome with built in tv screens on the cardio equipment  Perhaps the best thing though is the Lakeshore Path thats just a few blocks away from the hotel  There are  miles of beautiful scenery and you can get a very detailed map from the concierge with directions to get to the path  As others have said you have to pay for internet access here which is a huge hassle but there are stations where you can print your boarding pass which is helpful  The line to speak to someone at the concierge desk can get long but they are pretty knowledgeable about stuff  I used a kiosk in the lobby to checkout but the kiosk computers were rather slow so I dont think it was necessarily faster than checking out with the lobby staff  Aside from the internet issue I was very pleased with the quality of this hotel and would stay here again for another conference  
P => Hyatt   Dangerous Dirty  We stayed on the Regency Levelquot of this hotel and I would NEVER stay at this location again  It was dirty and dangerous  After checking into the hotel we proceed to our room on the  floor via their elevators  While trying to get on the   elevator the doors started to close on my young child  The doors DID NOT retract and the right door went over my childs croc shoe leaving him stuck My husband had to push on the doors to prevent them from closing on my son I cant even imagine what would have happened to my child if my husband had not been there as well bc the other hotel guest present just kept on walking by  I immediately notified the front desk  They sent a manager and a security person to our room to take a statement  They offered an apology  They did not close the elevator or take other precautions from what I observed  Later that day they did close another elevator in the same tower because the doors were stuck  Elevator issues are obviously an ongoing issue for this hotel  Now to describe the room DUSTY and DIRTY  There was so much dust in the room that it was starting to fall over the top of objects that had never been dusted  The bathroom had splatters of stuff on the walls and the mechanisms on the tub were falling off  The or of the room was very odd  Over each bed were  large metal crane like lights that reminded me of something that would be in a dors examining room  The chairs were well worn  In the lobby the chairs and sofas were torn I would not stay here again  It is not child friendly  The lobby is loud televsions music open dining etc  Just too much  There are a lot of great hotels in Chicago  However this is NOT one of them 
P => Chicago Hyatt Regency on East Wacker Drive Hyatt Regency Chicago  East Wacker DriveThe Hyatt Regency is a  star hotel ideally located for tourists on the Chicago River between the Loop and the Magnificent Mile north Michigan Avenue  It is within a few blocks of the elevated trains serving ORD and MDW and is one block from several CTA bus stops  The CTA transit passes and route map are great for tourists and even include airport trains The rooms are nicely orated and the bedding is top quality  The bathroom is efficient  Even numbers above  in the west tower should give you a nice view of the river What makes this hotel outstanding is the staff    the best trained I have encountered anywhere even better than at most  star hotels  First impressions are important and the staff makes sure that one feels welcome from the moment one arrives  Granted the check in  be scripted but it is so pleasant that four weeks and two international trips later I still remember the names of our receptionists I booked several rooms as a gift for my wife and her girlfriends for a five day shopping and sightseeing trip and our check in was flawless There are only two caveats when staying at this hotel First the climate control  be a problem  Most of our rooms were comfortable but mine on a arate floor was quite chilly  When turned up my thermostat made noise but no heat  Bring an indoor sweater or jacket in cool seasons  Second the hotel s surcharges are unnecessarily high  For example including taxes parking is  per night double the city parking rate at the nearby Randolph Street Millennium Park underground garage and some guests even park at the airports or in the suburbs and take the train into the city there is a  per night fee if you put any personal items in the mini fridge and internet usage is  per day extra To me these rates seem hostile and undo much of the good will the staff creates  However any savvy traveler can avoid them  For example Bockwinkel s grocery is only half a block south of the hotel on the street between the hotel s two towers  There one can purchase an entire hot rotisserie chicken a baguette fresh fruit and a bottle of basic wine for less than the Hyatt charges for two glasses of its ordinary house wine  each  Perhaps the best part of our stay was the price  Because the hotel has a huge inventory of rooms we were able to obtain a rate of  per room per night plus taxes and fees through bidding on Priceline  That rate makes this Chicago s best hotel deal ever Enjoy the Hyatt Regency Chicago but watch out for those surcharges Happy and safe travel 
P => What a Platinum Service experience should feel like Our quick one night stay at the Hyatt Regency in Chicagos loop was perhaps one of the best hotel experiences that Ive had for leisure My boyfriend and I checked in late in the evening around PM and learned that a special room had been reserved for us  Recently I received Platinum membership status in their Gold Passport rewards program  The manager came out to personally greet us and shook my hand  They had satisfied my request of getting a Regency Club room on a high floor near an elevator  Better yet the view was FANTASTIC  I believe it to be the best view this hotel would have of the river and Michigan Lake  The room itself was spacious and clean  The layout was also unique in the sense that the bed was in the middle of the room and the quotofficequot desk space was behind it  It felt modern but homey  I also happen to very much appreciate the Bose iPod desk player  clock as I like to plug in my music wherever I travel  The king sized bed was a bit too comfortable  it was difficult for us to leave it  Since we had a Regency Club room it came with a complimentary breakfast among other beveragessnacks throughout the day  After relaxing a bit with fresh fruit and pastries we asked the club concierge about where to buy mens shoes  The gentleman was very helpful and provided a thoughtful recommendation which saved us a LOT of time  Later the concierge at the front desk also was helpful in recommending a good barber shop for my boyfriend as well  Lastly they also had the most delicious Grilled Cheese sandwich in their late night room service menu    
P => Ideal location luxurious but impersonal massive hotel I typically never stay at hotels within a large metropolis as the parking and the hotel rates tend to be extraordinarily expensive  Usually I stay within the suburbs  However this time I stayed in downtown Chicago at the Hyatt Regency and I was very satisfied with the hotel  I got a fairly ent rate from an online travel booking website  Check in can be done either with the front desk or through a check in kiosk which was fairly speedy in dispensing my room keys  The employees were all very polite  Room service and the stocked mini bar were both very expensive so I passed on those  There is a covered interior parking garage right next to the Hyatt where I parked my car  It was slightly cheaper but still very pricey than the Hyatts valet only parking  I did not like paying for the very expensive wi fi internet access but the access was at least very fast over mbps  The bathroom and the bedroom were both gorgeous in oration  The pillows comforter and bed were all very luxurious and wonderful  I liked the specialty Portico white ginger spa toiletries  I do caution that this hotel does have over  rooms and is probably the largest hotel in Chicago so expect lots of foot traffic and be prepared to be independent as there wont be that much personal service given to you  
P => Poor service for cheap price  I had read some mixed reviews about this hotel on TripAdvisor so I was concerned about the hotel room itself however I wasnt too disappointed  I was more disappointed in the LACK of service the front desk had  There are automated check in kiosks which is a nice touch  These kiosks should not however replace humans especially if a guest has questions  For a  star hotel I really expected better customer service  I have had better service from a Holiday Inn Express  I guess thats what happens when you book a hotel from priceline  However Ive had great service with some of the other hotels Ive booked through priceline In any case there are  towers to this hotel  The main check in area is on the nd floor in the East tower  When you first enter the lobby area in the East tower theres an area with nice couches and behind that is a nice water fountain theme  The nd floor has the bell desk check in and concierge  If you have a room in the West Tower theres a bridge to the right of the check in area  On the first floor of the East tower theres a gift shop and a coffeeexpress shop for coffee breakfast food and snacks  If you want to pay less for water or what not theres a grocery store behind the hotel  You go out the doors next to the cyber cafe diagonal from Js Express and take a left  Its a quick walk  There are multiple restaurants and bars within the hotel so getting food is not difficult  I cant comment on the food since I didnt go to any of the restaurants  There are a lot of good restaurants in Chicago so I say venture out  Ou Sy Sushi is a good place not too far The room itself was okay  The hotel does a pretty accurate description and other travelers have taken many pictures so I didnt do that  Theres a fridge in the room but you cant remove any of the items  The hotel will charge you if you move the items off their sensors in the fridge  Their bath products are made by Portico Spa  The soap is very drying  The shampoo and conditioner are okay  The location of the hotel isnt bad  Its in between the Museum Campus and the major shops on the Magnificent Mile  If you want to head up to say Water Tower you walk towards Michigan Ave and Wacker Drive and take the  bus north and it will take you to the shopping areas  If you can stay at this hotel for a really cheap price then I would say its not too bad as long as you are okay with having very little help from the front desk  The rest of the staff I have encountered were great 
P => WONDERFUL HOTEL Excellent hotel great staff clean rooms very polite and efficient front desk and bell team i was very impressed    will be back again and will tell all my friends 
P => Stunning The hugeness of the hotel itself is a treat to eyes  I loved the food and the amenities  Hotel has everything you want  The location of the hotel is in the heart of the city and almost every bus reaches here  The view from the hotel of the city is stunning  I simply loved it the most  
P => Great location excellent service beautiful view Stayed here with my  year old for a week of fun  Everything about this hotel was great  The service was friendly and eager to help  from the bellboys to the concierge  We asked for a view and we were right over the river facing the beautiful Chicago skyline  Everything is within an enjoyable walking distance  One great feature is that the hotel connects to an office plaza with several quick restaurants on the bottom floor  Try the Tokyo Lunchbox for quick but fresh sushi The concierge helped map out public transportation for each day and their advice was right on We had a wonderful Chicago adventure and cant wait to return  GO SEE BLUE MAN AND JERSEY BOYS  THEY ARE BOTH MUSTS 
P => Large urine stains found on comforter   partial refund issued  My husband son and I stayed  nights at the Hyatt  The location was great   a short walk to tons of attractions and steps away from The Magnificent Mile  The service was also top notch by every employee at the hotel On our second and last night I woke up and flipped the comforter over to get out of bed  It was a little further than I usually toss it and I noticed a yellow stain on the underside  I was disgusted and surprised but when I continued to turn the comforter over   I was speechless  There were two large basket ball sized urine stains on the underside of the comforter  feet away from the foot of the bed  The stains were dry and there were no other ks anywhere on the bed  I immediately took pictures and called the front desk to request a manager  A person named Kaylee came in and was also disgusted and was shocked that it wasnt thrown out I explained to him that I did not want to ask for any compensation as no dollar amount could justify sleeping in urine  He understood and explained that he would take care of it and he would make things right and seemed genuinely concerned We went for breakfast then proceeded to check out  At the front desk we saw that he did in fact request a refund but only partial  We were still billed for things like parking internet usage etc  We actually paid over  for staying  nights in a bed with urine stains that  or  not have been washed they still cant prove if it was a washed stain or if it was unwashed I went back and told them to take the money back and I would rather pay full price then take their partial refund  It felt like a slap in the face  Even the agent at the front desk told me that if I went to him first he would have wiped the slate clean and refunded everything and agreed that it was their opportunity to make things right  He was seemed shocked that the manager didnt request a full refund  He mentioned that even him as an agent could have authorized it I am upset that a hotel like the Hyatt could penny pinch  But my main concern is that I would never have seen this urine   it was an accident  How many other people in that hotel are sleeping on filthy beddingHow can I report this to a higher authority Any help would be appreciated  
P => Good place if you get the right price We got a great deal of  per night through priceline  With this price the hotel is great even for double that price it would have been a good deal  The hotel itself is a little weird though they only had the computer check in machine when we checked in so we did not actually talk to anyone about our room preference  We received a room on the th floor which had a giant spot light pointed directly at our window all night the blinds blocked it out but it was not the best  Also the house keeping people we obsessed with cleaning our room between  and am after we went to the gym which was nice our bed was made and we hadnt even used the shower yet  Also on other days they waiting in the halls for people to get up  The location is good and we walked pretty much everywhere or took the train that was nearby  Other complaints about the high price of internet and food there seem a bit funny  This is a business hotel and they expect that their customers will have their businesses paying for everything  The prices for these things are the same at most other business style hotels I have been to  Just book it on priceline and use your savings to eat elsewhere the corner bakery on Michigan was pretty good for breakfasts  
P => Felt like a Mall Good things first staff was helpful and efficient and the location was fantastic  Otherwise it was a perfectly average conventioneer hotel which I would give a solid three star rating  We got the room over Easter weekend at a rock bottom rate of night through Priceline and we upgraded at a cost of night at the hotel for a room with a view   corner room  The atrium of the hotel which looks so amazing in the photos feels like a mall or a snazzy airport terminal  It doesnt have that special four star feel that you get at the nearby InterContinental or Renaissance which weve also stayed at  The room was a good size but it would have gone up tremendously in ambiance had the bed been on the opposite wall so as to take advantage of a spectacular view of the Wrigley Building  As it was it looked out onto a more ordinary building  The bed was adequate with a nice down comforter but the mattress couldnt hold a candle to what you get at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers just across the river  No sweet pillow top mattress at the HyattThe bathroom was most disappointing  The room was dark and drab with the most annoying toilet weve ever come across  It was perfectly clean and worked perfectly well but you had to bend low and reach under the tissue box to use the flushing lever  Most awkward  The over the sink lighting was not adequate and the room on the whole had a dated feel All in all I would say it was an quotokayquot hotel  It was clean and the staff was well trained and the location on the river was great  But there are other better choices out there if youre after a four star experience  
P => Over rated I have only stayed at this hotel when I have purchase the room for a bargain price on Priceline  This is NOT a  star hotel  It is at best a  star that happens to be in a great location  If you stay here be prepared for a massive impersonal hotel populated by conference and convention goers On my recent  night visit they were overbooked good for them must be the only hotel in the land in that position these days and they offered to comp me for  night at the Swisshotel next door  I would have jumped at the chance but my schedule was hectic and I couldnt afford the time to unpack and repack and schlep back to the Hyatt for the second night  Because of their over sold position they had to put me in a smoking room I didnt realize those still existed for the first night  It reeked  My clothes still smell  As compensation they gave me a  Hyatt gift card which is probably fair but all things considered I would have much preferred to have gotten the non smoking room I booked and for which I prepaid for  nights Because it is discounted so heavily on Priceline I will probably wind up here again but I hope not  
P => Horrible   will never stay there again Upon arrival I was told it would cost me  a night to park my car with the hotel  Ive never paid for parking with a hotel before so you can imagine my surprise and dissapointment  After discussing this with the front desk he really could care less  I told him I was unhappy and would be writing a bad review he didnt care  He said I should have looked at their website closer and I wouldve been informed of that however I just got done looking it over and could not find it anywhere  The rooms were musty  They wouldnt replace towels unless you request it  They had mini bars in the room and charged you  if you put any of your personal items in the fridge or moved anything in it  Talk about nickle and diming you No hot water at night  We were suppose to stay  nights but left after the st night 
P => Poor value This hotel must survive on convention business because without this the facility would die rather quickly  To their credit staff members are all polite and efficient  Rooms are DARK and OLD  While colors and furniture have been updated the walls in my room were in poor shape  The shower head is the worst of the low flow to be found  Bathroom was old with poor lighting as well  Unless you are in Chicago at a convention is this facility you can do much better nearby at other hotels  
P => Highly Recommended Hotel for Conferences Stayed here for some meetings and this property performs as expected for a Hyatt Regency Hotel  First off the hotel is rather massive and has nice selections of restaurants and bars  The rooms themself were acceptable and fairly updated  Fitness center was nice as well  The service could be improved a bit  While friendly the front desk staff was slow at their tasks  Being that the hotel is so large due to its convention space it is a well equipped conference center hotel  Location is nice being that it is in the downtown Chicago area  
P => Unimpressed Reasons why this Hyatt disappointed No free Internet in ANY part of the hotel  I understand that Chicago is a big fairly expensive city but even budget hotels offer free wireless  it costs  cents per minute There was no fan or vent in the bathroom  gross Mildew on the caulking of the bathtub  Condensation all over the window  Mold on carpet under window due to constant condensation  The exterior of the Hotel is hideous one of the ugliest buildings in Chicago   The hallways look like an outdated apartment comlpex  The non smoking room smelled of smoke  There is a  charge if you put your own personal food items in the in room mini fridge  Housekeeping is instructed to purge personal items daily  Personal fridges are available for a charge of   Be careful not to move ANY item from the minibar because you WILL be charged even if the item was not consumed just moved   Definately not worth the  plus  conference rate  My employer paid for it since I was attending a conference but other people have pricelined it for as low as    Parking valet is the only option is  per day  I heard presenters at my conference comment that the conference facilities and facilitators were disorganized and mediocre Some positives about this Hyatt The staff is extremely friendly Excellent location  The pillows on the bed were comfortable  There is an i pod alarm clock where you can charge your i pod Overall I was very unimpressed with this hotel  I stayed a block away at the Hardrock for half the price and it was much better  
P => Great location   but veeeeeeeeeeery pricey I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a conference held in the hotel from ch    Since the room was paid for I brought along my husband for company  Heres what we thoughtCheck   in The concierges were super nice We arrived around pm and were able to go directly to our room Room   nice  We upgraded to floor  from floor   Excellent choice  The walls are paper thin but they put us at the end of a hallway so there was less noise  We had a view overlooking Whacker Street and the Chicago River  Very nice Didnt use the internet because it was  per day  Bed is large and comfy with LOTS of extra pillows  TV really sucked  Being in a town like Chicago didnt warrant a lot of time for T V  but when we did want to use it it was grainy and very user unfriendly Prices   this is where they get you Hotel parking was  per day  Wine at the bar was  per glass  Our lunch   salad and wine for me half sandwich soup and  beers for hubby   was  not including tip But everything in Chicago is pricey so you end up just sucking it up   Big Bar   super friendly  Never had an issue getting a cocktail Daddy Os   once again super friendly  I dont know how people can review that the hotel staff is unfriendly   we never experienced anything negativeLayout   took me a full day and many wrong turns to get to my conference rooms on time  There are  towers and multiple floors for conferences so this was confusing Some things we did that are worth mentioningBubba Gump Shrimp Company   fun and tastyWalk along Navy Pier cold in ch but neatCheesecake Factory   Yum yum yumDublins pub on Rush Street   found wonderful Hoegaarden beer Field Museum   Sue the largest T Rex  is thereSears Tower   just a great viewShedd Aquarium   the Oceanarium was closed but good place to visit overall if youre a teacher you can get in freeWould recommend Hyatt to people but just make sure to bring lots of extra  
P => Great hotel but know the tricks if youre on a budget My wife and I stayed here for a romantic weekend  We booked on Hotwire and from my research I actually thought we would be in another property  I think we paid a good price but could have saved some more using Priceline  Hyatt Regency hotels are not designed for the budget traveler  Everything except the room itself costs extra and is grossly overpriced  For instance internet access costs almost  for a day and parking is almost as much as the room  We got into trouble for using the minbar fridge for some of our own food and when we tried to access it in the morning it had been locked remotely  We did get them to open it though  The staff are used to dealing with corporate travelers spending other peoples money who dont care how much stuff costs so any recommendations from the Concierge desk are suspect The room itself was very nice with a great view up Michigan Avenue  The bed was comfortable the sheets were good quality the pillows were plump and the towels were thick and large  The bathroom could have been cleaner but I didnt notice it so Im reporting what my wife said  The location is central as it sits right between the loop and the Magnificent Mile but if you dont like walking you  feel that it is isolated We lived well all weekend and did not spend an extra penny in the hotel  Here is how we did it  Some of the things we were prepared for others we discovered by trial and error For free internet access there is a Corner Cafe at the intersection of Michigan and Whacker  There is also a Dominicks grocery store two blocks to the north on Columbus  If you are looking for it you have to go down some stairs at the front of the hotels drop off area to access the street level below  They advertize Wifi there and I think it is free  They stay open until  am and have an excellent deli and lots of great bargains on wine if you sign up for their shopper card  We found these places on our own  The Concierge had no clue about budget travelling We parked at Midway airport and took the CTA train to State and Lake about four blocks from the hotel  If you had a lot of luggage a cab would only be a few dollars but we walked it  You can get an online coupon from Parksavers for   a day and the CTA costs   or you can buy a  hour pass for   which we did on Saturday and it got us back to the car  Parksavers is right across the street from the CTA station If you have been to Chicago before and done the downtown shopping and architecture admiration we recommend getting on the CTA and exploring the neighborhoods  Lincoln Park Wrigleyville are great  We especially loved wWcker Park which is on its way up and still a little bit funky  You can also buy half price theater tickets online or at a booth downtown  We had a great time at an off off broadway production So the Hyatt is a luxury hotel with great views and if you know how to work it you can have a great weekend on a budget  
P => Great hotel for a great price I booked this hotel via priceline com and got a great deal for about  per night  The hotel is in a good location just a block away from michagan avenue  The hotel room was fine no problems with it  Room was really clean  We were located at the end of a corridor so we didnt have many people passing by but you could hear people in the corridor when they were there  We didnt hear any noise from the rooms on either side of us though breakfast is buffet style with the usual mix of hot and cold food  its  per person  Houlihans next door does something similar but with less choice for  Check in and out was very quick  Hotel staff all very friendly  Parking very expensive but then all hotels in chicago are like this  No free wi fi anywhere in the hotel which is a pity I would stay here again  
P => Wonderful I was somewhat nervous about this stay  I won a bid of  dollars on priceline and immediately began my do my review search  The reviews were all over and I have learned to take it lightly when there is a bad review of a hotel  As was the case with the Hyatt I do not know what some people expect but this was defiantly a  star hotel  The bed was amazing extremely comfortable with alot of fluffy pillows The room and bathroom were very clean  I would recommend this hotel to anyone The location was great as walking to the Magnificent mile or Navy Pier was very easy and close  The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and nice  The hotel itself is beautiful and very large  Please do not hesitate to stay here  
P => Location cant be beat but some issues We just returned from a  night stay at this hotel over St  Pattys day weekend  We paid  per night for this hotel which also included  quotfreequot buffet breakfast coupons each day through Travelzoo  Ive stayed in this location before but not at the Hyatt at the Swissotel which is right next door  The location cant be beat right next to the river and one block from Michigan Ave perfect area  Although we got a great deal on the hotel I would choose the Swissotel again if the rates were similar  The beds in the Hyatt were extremely hard so much so that my hips hurt in the mornings  The blankets on the bed consisted of one sheet and another thin blanket I missed the down comforters that Im used to in a hotel of this type  The walls were so thin that you could hear everything going on in the hallways and even though we were on the th floor we could hear traffic noise  The view we had was horrible looked directly into an office building next door so our curtains stayed completely closed whenever we were in the room  Breakfast buffet at Bistro  was good   great even better because it was included in our rate  I loved the quotBig Barquot a great place to meet friends people everywhere very bustling and fun with good service  Friends of ours had an issue with check in but our check in was speedy and friendly although we had to ask for the breakfast buffet coupons it didnt automatically show up on our ressie  Our friends issue was resolved to their satisfaction  The staff around the hotel were always very friendly stopping to say quothelloquot and ask if we needed help  Elevators were usually pretty quick never had to wait for one but being on the higher floor it made alot of stops while going down  High Speed internet cost  per day  Id stay here again if the rate was as good but Id be certain to request better bedding and be a fan for the room to help block out some of the noise  The room was a bit tired looking too with dark gray walls in the bathrooms and the carpet beginning to wear a bit  Swissotel next door was fabulous with glass enclosed showers updated fixtures much better beds etc     so it was very hard not to keep comparing  Hyatt has the better nightlife hands down  
P => Great Location Expensive Amenities I stayed here for a conference over St  Patricks Day weekend  The location cant be beat and the staff are amazingly helpful  And the rooms are ently sized with confortable beds  On the downside the lighting in the bathrooms is wretched making it hard to put on makeup the cover on the boxspring had several mystery stains on it and the food at the hotel os very pricey I expect to be charged more when buying food and beverages but   for a  bottle of pop is a bit much And the breakfast buffet at Bistro  is fabulous but at  a head it had better be All in all a good stay just a little on the pricey side  
P => Best customer service Ive experienced in a long time  Got this hotel on Priceline for night   for  nights with feestaxes  As other reviewers have said the nightly parking rate almost cost as much as the room  The hotel charges  hours for parking with no self park option  Nearby I was able to find a lot for  hours  Im sure there are cheaper options if one is willing to walk further  Arrived well before check in time and was able to check into room  East Tower right away which was well appreciated  Room itself was a pleasant surprise  Modern clean for the most part and comfortable  Huge flat screen TV two beds one easy chair one additional chair and a desk chair with wheels  The bathroom was spacious however the counter space was somewhat limited My only complaint about the room was the hotcold water situation  Often there was no sufficient hot water in the morning for showers  In the evening there was no cold water hot water came out of both taps even the cold  The fix for this was to run the bath tub on cold and let the extreme hot water drain off  Even the toilet pipes were piping hot during the evenings  Strange situation  The hot water in the morning was adequate but not as hot as I would have liked  The hotel itself is huge with over  rooms countless meeting rooms and several massive conferenceconvention rooms  The hotel is divided into east amp west towers with indoor connecting a connecting bridge on floor  and tunnel on floor    Check in is located on the second level with several food options on the lower level Nothing at this hotel is inexpensive  The coffee bar second floor bar steak house lobby restaurant are all very expensive  There is not a lot in the immediate area but lots of options if one is willing to walk  minutes away  There is a good convience storeket behind the hotel  Prices there are reasonable for water alcohol snacks The business center charges offensive rates for internet use   per  minutes and   per page if one wishes to print  That said free airline check in and boarding pass printing is available at the conceirge desk on the second level  There are also internet terminals across from the lobby coffee shop on the first level which  be a cheaper option As other reviewers have stated there is a lot of noise that can be heard  Although I was not disturbed by guests on either side of me the doorway to the hall allows a lot of noise transmission  Even with the ear plugs in that I brought I was awoken the first day by noise in the hall a first for me when traveling  Usually in northern hotels in the winter I find the hotel rooms very very dry  Somehow this hotel has solved this problem  The air was always very moist  Im not sure how they do this on such a massive scale but I certainly appreciated it  The air always smelt fresh and always had a pleasant smell I cant say enough about the staff at this hotel  They are trained well  Everyone I encountered went out of their way to be pleasant say quothiquot and ask if there was anything they could do  I saw one employee walking by an open elevator door stop and place their arm in the closing doors so a couple could make it on before the doors closed  I was allowed to make a long distance call using a phone in the lobby  Every single staff member was a plesure to deal with at this property  
P => Gorgeous clean and friendly staff My friend and I did a girlfriends weekend here in late ruary  Got the room for  per night on Priceline which was a fantastic deal  Everything was what youd expect from a Hyatt   clean updated rooms and fantastic service from the workers  It wasnt on the main drag Michigan Ave  but wasnt so far off to make it a hard walk  It might be a problem to get there on foot for disabled elderly or folks with young kids  But its an easy enough walk to the art museum Millennium Park and train station and Trader Joes on Ontario 
P => Great central location We booked our room on Priceline and got a good deal at around  per night  We stayed for the first  nights of our US trip so didnt use too many of the hotels facilitiesThe hotel is centrally located just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue and around a mile from Navy PierOur room was clean and comfortable and on the th floor we had a good view of the city and could just about see Lake Michigan though the weather was very bad  The layout of the room is a little peculiar with the bed facing away from the window but over all we have no complaints about this hotel and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guestsSo pros and consProsHelpful and friendly staffClean and comfortable throughoutSpacious roomsLarge and airy public areasStarbucks and gift shop in lobbyConsA large hotel so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk  lobby area 
P => Good Stay Staff were friendly room was well kept like a typical Hyatt location  Hotel is huge with two buildings and over  rooms  Good location close to Michigan Ave and the subway  Parking is day  Ouch I bid on it on Priceline for   
P => s style convention hotel I was there for a convention as were all of the other guests  The rates were good  The rooms view was awesome  the room was tiny  The restaurant Stetsons was pricey but excellant  the morning buffet breakfast was very good but very expensive  The fitness center was good  the quotBig Barquot was a hopping place with so so food  It is the only late night option for food other than room service  I would go back because it has a great location a great view and good pricing for the room  
P => Great place for business travelers A group of us planned a business trip up in the windy city during uary  I have used the Hyatt before  years ago  and remembered I enjoyed my stay so I booked  of us in it again Check in was friendly and easy  My room was on the th floor and the others were higher up  The elevators although plenty of them where very slow and seemed to stay on the penthouseexecutive levels for extended periods of time  There is a great work out room but can get very crowded and overbearing especially if you are trying to use free weights at all  I finally gave up on working out on day  because it was just too much  not the hotels fault  so if you do enjoy working out best to bring some bands or other items to use in your room The rooms were spacious updated and clean  I had no issues with housekeeping although I felt there  have been some snooping in my stuff while I was out  nothing stolen but just not how I left it   The TV is large and swivles so you can view it from the table and work area the bathroom was a good size  The lighting in the bathroom really is poor but they do offer a magnifying mirror that has a light so that is a bonus  I heard from co workers that their water pressure absolutely stunk but mine was excellent  There is The big bar downstairs or as we like to call it the wall of liquor Always packed and very friendly wait staff  Great area to eat or have a night cap  The breakfast buffett was amazing but was  dollars a person  So we ate their once and then either got something from the vendor across from the giftshop or ate at the Billy Goat Tavern which is across the bridge  We did rent out the Astor Suite one night for a customer meeting  The suite was awesome and again the staff that helped us make the meeting a sucess was great There was always taxis available if needed and plenty to do The location of this hotel is great and although the photos I have added are not amazing they do give you a feel for the place  Overall I would definately stay at the Hyatt again 
P => Professional Staff at the Hyatt I stayed at the Hyatt this past weekend with my wife and  month old Dhter  We booked a standard king with reward points and a special rate with parking and breakfast included  The room was small but the staff had added a crib as requested  My only complaint about the Hotel were the walls like stated before they are very thin  It wasnt a problem the first couple of nights as there were not many other people on our floor  That was probably good as our Dhter was adjusting read crying and screaming during the first couple of nights  The last night some younger folks ided to have a large party in their room down the hall from us  We called security who prompty came to their room to quit them down   and they were fine after that  The breakfast buffet is very nice and the Gold Passport Security and check in staff for very professional and courteous  I was very impressed Other than the thin walls and noise issues wich didnt last long we had a nice stay but will probably opt for a suite to give our dhter a arate room to sleep  
P => Great Hotel nice large clean rooms  close to everything  could easily walk anywhere  easy check incheck out with the self check kiosk  the walls were a little thin  bed was extremely comfortable  great views especially from my th floor room  got a great deal from Entertainment one time offer   ior suite for night  
P => Not  star very noisy thin walls poor food Okay the location is great  And I asked to be up high so they put me on the th floor with a lake view  The staff was really nice  But I was disappointed in the hotel itself  My room was artsy and attractive but the walls were extremely thin  I could hear normal conversations in the rooms on either side and also in the hallway quite loudly  In fact the entire hotel is very loud  Usually in a  star place there are options for quiet like at least one classy upscale restaurant in which to have a fine meal  Not here  The finest on site restaurant is the Chop House which had a noisy crowd  The atrium has another restaurant a bistro and a bar but the cavernous space makes everything sound like Disneyland  The only other small restaurant is Pronto Mamas where the deli cases and fridges hum at a frighteningly high volume and the loud overhead music cant be turned down I asked the waiter was helpful but apparently the volume is fixed  So the meal was accompanied by Volare and Frank Sinatra blasting overhead  But then lets talk about the food  I ordered grilled salmon on a bed of pesto pasta  The pasta instead of being lightly tossed with pesto was drenched in it with cheese so thick the pasta glommed together all swimming in an olive oil soup  The salmon was so coated in pepper that my mouth burned    there was no warning on the menu that this dish would be spicy or quotpicantequot plus its pretty hard to mess up salmon    but thats what they did  Note that they also nickle and dime you at this hotel with extra charges such as high speed internet for the exhorbitant rate of  per day  If you want a room thats  visually  attractive but you dont mind paper thin walls and you plan to eat elsewhere this hotel would be fine  But I wouldnt call it  star and I dont think the price is worth what you get  Altogether I was disappointed in this property  
P => I dont know why Hyatt keeps their name on this hotel This hotel is fine if your idea of service is a particularly nice Holiday Inn in the late s  The only trouble is they think they deserve  rates  The place is a huge mess architecturally With a dated ugly lobby that is either too hot or too cold depending on Chicagos weather  The staff is friendly but poorly managed Apparently no one has ever instructed the housekeepers not to shout down the hall to each other and a used room service tray sat in the hall across from my room unattended and unlovely for a day and a half until I finally called Room Service and asked them to take it awayThe quotBig Barquot is an expensive incredibly mediocre establishment where you can expect to wait  minutes with a dirty glass from a previous customer in front of you before you are approached by a bartender  The one bright spot is Stetsons The resident steakhouse which has a nice staff and at least a bit of an idea of service  Seriously Hyatt is not doing themselves any favors by keeping their name on this thing  Im sure its a cash cow as they have plenty of convention space here and something like  rooms but youd think Hyatt   with their corporate headquarters around the corner   would think twice about this blight on their brand  Tear it down rebuild it and start over with a well trained and well managed staff  
P => Great location though poor in service I stayed there for six nights and the only major problem I encountered was when they gave me a th floor room where the bathroom sink was broken  I called them and was put on hold for  minutes then waited an hour for the service maintenance to come in  The maintenance said that it was going to take him a couple of hours to fix When he said this I packed my luggage and asked the reservation desk to give me another room   they knew I was not happy and didnt question my room change request  So I ended up on the nd floor and had a great view of the river  Other than that the rest of my stay was pretty good  The location couldnt have been better as the hotel property is in the heart of Chicago downtown just a block away from the Magnificent Mile  Getting taxis were pretty easy as they lined up in front of the hotel almost all the time  There were about three different conventions going on in the hotel during my stay so every morning was a hustle and bustle   if youre looking for a serene atmosphere this hotel is not what for you  Theres also lines at the concierge most of the time so make time for that  I had breakfast there for one morning and wasnt too impressed but I do love the fact that there is a Starbucks inside the hotel  I wished they had free Wi fi because I travel with my laptop all the time and had to pay for connectivity per day  
P => Convenient location in the loop Weve stayed here before so we knew what to expect  Great location if youre staying in the Loop and hitting Michigan Avenue  No issues at all with the hotel  
P => Not a problem to be had    Got a great deal for a  square ft room on the nd floor for  through Orbitz  Would go back there is a second  They had a perfect location and great staff  ASked the concierge about a good sushi restaurant  He gave us directions and the name of his sister who worked there who would take care of us  Room was perfect to relax and sleep  I woke up at  saturday morning thinking it was still the middle of the night it was so dark and quiet in there We were out on the town most of the time so we didnt eat at our hotel but friends told us they were very good Dont let negative reviews steer you away from here  They are  in a   Get a good rate go to the Hyatt to sleep but go enjoy Chicago instead of complaining about taxis and noise  
P => paper thin walls We recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency while attending a conference there  It is a large hotel but we never experienced waiting very long for the elevators  the work out facility is very nice  However that is about the only positive  We quickly found out the rooms are VERY noisy We could hear complete conversations in the room next to us  We were lucky enough to have neighbors that ided to have those converstations at  am after bar time  We also had a broken phone in the room and the heater made a horrible noise when it kicked on  We ended up turning it off at night so we could sleep  The day we left they finally fixed it  It is in an excellent location  It was extremely difficult to get a taxi though  There was a line of about   people waiting for a cab in the evening  Overall it was convenient to stay here while the conference was going on but I would never choose to return for a leisure trip Also there is a night parking fee which is outrageous  
P => ent Hotel for the Cheap Rate I booked at stay at the Hyatt Regency for         I was able to get unusually cheap rate  per night for the downtown area by booking the hyatt com non refundable internet rate  Once I booked the hotel I came to this site and read the reviews and immediately became concerned from all the negative comments  I have stayed at this hotel once before but about five years ago after the reation  I called the hotel and told them I was concerned about the quality of my stay after reading multiple negative reviews on various sites  At that time the gentleman I spoke to upgraded me to a Deluxe King room with a view  Upon arriving I didnt have any problem with check in at the hotel as it went fairly quickly and without a hitch  As far as the room it was spacious and clean  The bathroom was clean but not that large and there was nothing fancy about it  Also on our second evening there we got ready to shower and head out for the night only to find there was no hot water  The highlight of this room was the upgraded room  We we on the th floor with an awesome view of the Chicago River and Michigan Avenue  After getting over the cold water obstacle on our second night we headed downstairs to hit the town  I already had the address in hand but needed directions  The concierge desk was closed but I figured it would be no big deal to either use one of the computers in the business center or ask one of the front desk clerks to mapquest directions for me Other hotels have done this before  The business center was closed and the front desk clerk told me they didnt have access to the internet to look up directions for me  I went outside and asked one of the valets for directions and none of them could provide any either  That was quite a bit irritating  You would think at minimum the hotel could provide a  hour business center or free wifi services in the rooms  I didnt bother bringing my laptop with me because of the ridiculous daily rate they charge for internet service Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Regency  However this is a  star hotel and the average rate is around  per night  I would never pay that rate to stay at this hotel  I can name at least ten others in the downtown vicinity that offer a better rate and better accomodations  While the room was clean it was a bit dull and drab and you can tell that this hotel is in need of some updating and reations  The walls were also paper thin  You could hear everything from your next door neighbors conversation to late night party goers ending their nights loudly in the hallways Next issue is with parking I understand that I am downtown and a lot of the hotels charge a similar rate but to me  per night is so ridiculous especially when you add this on to the average rate for these hotels To sum things up  Positives   If you are lucky enough to get a room with a view  If you are lucky enough to find a ent internet rate  Negatives   Rooms need reations  Bathroom are not up to par   For the price internet service should be free   No refrigeratorsmicrowaves in the rooms  No soda machines in the hallways you are forced to pay   for a soda or water out of the mini bar  Paper thin walls  We were constantly interruptedawakened by outside noise  Trouble with hot waterFor a hotel of this calibur I would expect a whole lot more  Again I wouldnt stay unless I got a good internet rate or booked on Priceline  The Palmer House Hilton W Hotel Westin Hotel Monaco and Doubletree are all cheaper and better options for your money  
P => ginal Hotel at best I stayed at this hotel to attend a conference at the hotel  Most of the reviews of this hotel are spot on   it is exactly like staying at the airport and I dont mean like staying at an airport hotel it is like staying in the middle of the terminal The lobby is really crowded and noisy no matter what time you pass through  The service is very impersonal and when we complained about not getting the room we reserved and about our less than clean room they responded as if they were reading from a script and could have cared less that we were unhappy  It was like they had heard it all before  The other reviews were also correct about the noise   you can hear everything in this hotel including your neighbors potty flushing in the middle of the night  Thankfully we were at the end of the hall so we didnt have to hear people passing by our room to go to the elevator but I can only imagine what others must have heard  If you stay in the East Tower on the backside as we did be aware   there is a fire station across the street and they literally had calls in the wee hours of the morning every night we were there  There are not enough restaurants in the hotel to handle the number of people staying there  The lines are long the food is expensive and not great  Hope that your conference is feeding you lunch mine did not or you wont have time to eat and get back to the afternoon sessions if you try to eat at the hotel due to the long lines and slow service  There was only one real restaurant serving lunch  There also are not enough elevators   we spent many times waiting  minutes for an elevator or having to pass up two or three elevators in a row because they were too full by the time they got to our floor  This hotel really is in a great location for walking to Michigan Avenue for all the shopping and dining  However there are a lot of other hotels just as convenient so I would recommend staying in one of those unless you have to stay at the Hyatt  I liked Chicago and the next time I go I will be staying somewhere else  
P => Great Location Stayed for  nights     Hotel Extremely busy and large Check inout QuickParking  valet parking  We stayed for  nights so were expecting to pay for  nights of parking but they only charged us for one  We were not the only ones to get a day taken off other people in the checkout line had similar experiences Room Clean spacious bathroom minimal toiletries provided  We had a view of the river which was nice  At night you could hear the wind  If you need a fridge in the room you cant use the mini bar instead you have to rent one for  for the duration of your stay  There is no free internet service or pool  The breakfast buffet is  but if you go across the street to Houlihans it is  Location Excellent  Just south across the bridge of the magnificent mile and just north of Millenium Park  But off on its own enough to feel like youre not in the middle of caos like the hotels on the magnificent mileOverall Would be happy if I had another winning bid through Priceline to stay here again  
P => Good hotel great location Stayed for  days on business  The hotel is centrally located  All the major sights of Chicago are within walking distance  The concierge was extremely helpful in giving me maps info and suggestions on how to get the most of my limited time for sight seeing The rooms are spacious with all the necessary amenities flat screen TV iron an item Ive come to treasure as not all hotels have one per room  I also had a great view of the river  I didnt make extensive use of the amenities due to limited free time but the staff was always more than courteous  The greeter did a great job of directing traffic so that you waited as little time as possible for the proper staff to assist you Its a very large hotel with  towers so if busy elevators and a loud lobby are not your thing you might want to look elsewhere  Otherwise I recommend the hotel especially for its location  
P => Nice Hotel I attend a business conference in Chicago each year and have stayed at the Hyatt Regency the past two visits  The hotel is located on Lake Michigan and has very nice accomodations  It is walking distance from the fantastic shopping on Michigan Ave however in the winter months  be an unbearable walk due to the cold winds  As an alternatitive the cab ride is only minutes away but be aware last trip we had a cabbie that didnt realize we knew the area well and ided to take a long detour and ran the meter up to  its only   cab ride  I was very impressed by our doorman who when we arrived and explained the situation immediately took action and called the citys consumer afairs line and reported him explaining he was no longer welcome to do business at his hotel  The hotel restaurant is excellent and there is a nice business lounge that stays busy on most evenings  Rooms are nice and staff is very accomodating 
P => Good business hotel I was there for  nights on business  Its a good normal business hotel and room The elevators are a little slow  Because the hotel has radiant heating and cooling it takes a while to change the temperature in the room The bar has a great view of the river  When you check in ask for a river view or lake view  The bed was very comfortable and had a nice flat screen TV  
P => Great Location This hotel was part of a package deal on Travelocity  The location was great Easy access to the mag mile amp opera  The room was very pleasant clean and comfortable although the dark modern style or seemed a little cold  The hotel was huge and getting to the room a bit of a trek due to the layout  However it was good value for an upscale hotel and the location was great  
P => A Dream Hotel I am a frequent traveller and I have stayed at different hotels however Hyatt Hotel is the best of them all  My nephew and I always book through priceline com and I still cant believe that a very exquisite hotel like Hyatt will accept our offer For a very low price offer we get to stay at a  star hotel Hyatt is so clean so classy so contemporary   I cant wait to sleep in those beds again I highly recommend Hyatt Regency Hotel to all travellers  
P => Fantastic Location I just returned from a  night convention stay at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago  No hotel is more centrally located in the heart of the city than the Hyatt  It is within walking distance of outstanding shopping museums and sights  Even late into the evening I never felt unsafe walking in neighborhood around the Hotel  The room I had appeared to be recently remodeled  It was clean and comfortable  The bed was outstanding  I was on the th floor and never had to wait more than a  minute for an elevator  The room was quiet and there was little hallway noise  In general I would say that this property ranks among one of Hyatts best  I look forward to returning to Chicago and the Hyatt will be the place I want to stay  
P => BIG Convention Hotel   Impersonal but efficient This is a LARGE convention hotel  It has all sorts of services and restaurants  Rooms are clean and ent size  Efficient if impersonal service  Good location just south of the Chicago River so is within walking distnce in good weather of the Magnificant Mile shops eateries and attractions  Underground connection to the Illinios Center which allows access to some shopping and dining without going outside This hotel was way too crowded for my taste but if you are attending a convention and this is one of the convention hotels it is a fine choice  However if you are a tourist other properties are more likely to suit your needs  
P => Great stay for Chicago athon weekend I booked a couple of rooms via Hotwire and then visited trip advisor as always to see what guests had to say about this hotel  I was really nervous after reading a number of negative comments posted but as you know there is no refunds or changing your mind when you book through Hotwire so I entered the weekend with low expectations  Well we had a great stay location is A to the mag mile and the other downtown attractions and the front desk allowed early check in and a late check out which was really nice  In addition they were able to accomodate a room with a view and the rooms were of reasonable size whcih isnt always the case in Chicago hotels It is indeed a massive hotel and the lobby is hectic but overall I thought it was a great place to stay and I would stay there again without a doubt  
P => Bad Experience at the Hyatt Regency Round  We stayed at the Regency on the  th of tember  There was a large group of us going to Chicago for a work event and I found a great rate through Travel Zoo  I believe we booked  rooms  My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt a few years back during the Christmas holidays and had a so so stay so I was hoping for a better stay this time  Upon check in my husband opted for a nicer suite and paid more per night  I think the bonus was the view out the window and going up to the hospitality room which wasnt really all that great since you had to pay for liquor honor bar  I think juices and coffeetea was free  The room was fine  Nothing to blogbrag about  I will say that the lobby area can be a crazy zoo  I think on the weekend nights it turns into a night club  I didnt experience it but thats what people told me  I will say what was horrible was all the Philly fans who were staying at the hotel  My husband is born and bred Chicagoan and was wearing a Bears jersey  He walked by the bar and had  people booing him  It was all fun though bc we didnt care  Must have sucked for all those people to come out to Chicago and lose  Oh well for them  Anyways what made the stay horrible  valet  If you stay overnight at the hotel you have to pay   There is no self park  There is a parking lot close by for  but you have to walk a distance and whats the point  Its not really the cost that kills me  It does kill me but when you have horrible service and are paying that much its a real dupe  At that price I would expect the customer service to be outstanding  It wasnt  My husband had called down one morning to get the car because he had to be somewhere for work  He called about  minutes ahead  Once he got to the valet stand it took another  minutes on top of his  minutes warning to pull up the car for the car to come  He ran late for his work event  Horrible  Then they mixed up our tickets when we were leaving for the airport to leave Chicago for home  nd really horrible thing On the Saturday evening my husband went out with his coworkers  I ided to stay in and just watch some tv  At about pm I heard a lot of noise in the hallway but didnt think much of it  It wasnt crazy but it was loud  At about pm I realized I hadnt put on the do not disturb sign  So I opened up my door to put the sign on the handle and a water bottle that was leaning on my door tipped over into my room spilling liquid on the carpet  The liquid hit my feet and I was startled being half asleep  I picked up the water bottle and felt that it was a bit warm and then looked at the liquid and it was yellow  Someone had urinated in a water bottle and left it leaning on my door  I called the manager on duty and they apologized and then sent up security to clean up the mess  Security came and cleaned up but they didnt even put any effort into cleaning up the spill  They took the bottle and then wiped the carpet using their shoes and sprayed some cleaning agent all around the area  The room smelled like chemicals  I cant believe that all I got was a sorry and some chemicals  Obviously the Hyatt doesnt care about repeat customers  I told my husband and he was furious  He complained at front desk  They said they could not find out who did it because there were no surveillance cameras up there  They said it was an invasion of privacy  Somehow I dont believe it  I am just going to say that the  times at the Hyatt it has not been great stays  Weve stayed at so many hotels in downtown Chicago  From the Swissotel Westins Ws InterCon Knickerbocker Drake Renaissance etc  After this I will never stay at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago  
P => Great location Stayed here for  nights for a BridgestoneFirestone convention  No complaints  Room was great with a beautiful view  Staff was very accommodating  Had drinks and appetizers in main bar  Fantastic Great location  Yes its a huge hotel as its used for conventions but that didnt stop it from being a great place  
P => Okay for business nonsmoking not enforced We stayed at this hotel to attend a business conference  Our taxi dropped us off at the east tower  Inside the lobby was immensely busy  The reviewers that likened this to an airport terminal are right on  We rode the escalator up to the nd level where fortunately there were no lines wating for registration  They offered we could upgrade to a river view room with king bed  Neither were available when I reserved a room before our trip  The special conference rates were booked up so we paid night for the river view room Our room was located across the street in the west tower which we accessed through the skywalk  Although a bit tired looking the room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the Wrigley Building Tribune Tower riverwalk etc  The bathtubshower combo didnt have any mold but a few tiles needed to be regrouted  The toilet was quite unexpected for this grade of hotel  Its nothing more than the standard tankless industrial toilet with metal flush lever  think airport restroom   I guess it matches the hotel airport lobby While the toilet was certainly functional the real problem is that the flush lever is back behind the toilet hidden beneath and behind the built in facial tissue bin   forcing you to become a bit of a contortionist to simply try and flush the thing  The bathroom also has no exhaust fan which creates a hot sauna after your shower  The air conditioning  heating system is radiant and was covered by the built in valance over the window  We never got the temperature right for us in the room and wished there would have been a whooshing noise from a fan to mask the noise from the room next door and the hallway  The air circulation from a fan would have been nice also  Another problem was there was a big gap underneath the room door making it impossible to keep out the cigarette smoke on our quotnonsmokingquot floor  The person in the room next to us smoked worse than a chimney  It was disgusting but they were allowed to continue  We had plenty of hot water but they were quite skimpy with toiletries and amenities  We were given only one small bar of bath soap to last  nights no shower cap mending kit or any of the little extras even some cheap hotels provide None of the hotel restaurants were open for dinner our first two nights there  Breakfast buffet in the lobby bistro was  food was very good  For something quick  theres an express ket in the lobby where you can buy snacks drinks prepared food etc  with a microwave and toaster to prepare what you buy  We ordered room service for breakfast one morning  the food was okay   mind you   breakfast is served only in the east lobby restaurant so by the time they got it across the street and up to our room it was only lukewarm We do not have subways and such where we live and are not used to walking in tunnels underneath buildings  It would have been greatly helpful if the Hyatt had maps or brochures in the rooms explaining their tunnel system  There is a skywalk connecting the east and west hotel towers  Once youre in the west tower you can go down to the Bronze level take elevator to st floor escalator down to Bronze and walk through that tunnel to the Illinois Center  Youll find a small grocery store shops and restaurants  We ate at Houlihans accessed through the tunnel or Wacker street since the hotel restaurants were closed  There is also a great little grocery store called Brookwinkles just one block south of the hotel on Stetson the street arating the east and west towers  Hotel parking is night  Internet is day  If you use the computer in their Cyber Cafe be prepared to pay hour  The hotel is located near the south end of the Miracle Mile so its a bit of a walk to all the shopping  Tiffanys and Macys is about two miles walk roundtrip  The hotel has a courtesy shuttle from the east TowerLobby to the Navy Pier  Their customer service was outstanding  One nice feature was being able to print our boarding tickets from their special courtesy terminals located in the concierge area in the east lobby  I might stay here again on a business trip especially if the conference is in the same hotel  Otherwise for a personal trip Id probably opt for a quieter hotel elsewhere  
P => Time for an update I was in Chicago on business recently and stayed at this hotel  I had stayed here several years before and I loved it but this time not so much  The room was strange because it had been updated but still looked old its hard to explain it  I think it was because even with all the lights on it was still on the darkish side  The floor was not flat   it had a few large bumps and dips under the carpet which was surprising and strange  And there was a large enough gap under my door into the hallway that I could clearly see daylight and shadows when people passed by  I would guess I could have fit my whole hand flat out the gap up to my wrist  These things made me wonder if there was a structural concern As I like my room cool I went immediately to the thermostat to crank it down low and I looked around and could not see any vents   there was though a large duct that went across the ceiling in front of the window they backlit the duct which was st otherwise it would have been unsightly but even backlit its pushing it and I have to say I had low expectations here but the room did cool off  If you are someone who likes quotwhite noisequot or the whirr of an AC unit dont expect that here   I have to say the climate unit was silent  Speaking of noise though you hear EVERYTHING here   doors slamming toilets flushing etc  I had to quickly shower and run out to a dinner and when I went into the bathroom that is where the problems began  The toilet was one of those industrial ones with no tank and just a lever  I dont care about that but I was surprised for a Hyatt Regency  Next there was no hot water  I let it run for a good  minutes and then since I was in a hurry I called the front desk and they seemed unconcerned they asked me if I had quotlet the water run   minutesquot and I said no I was hoping for immediate hot water  The lady was apologetic and said they could send someone up and I said fine but that I had to leave so they could come in and take a look in my absence wasnt crazy about that but what choice did I have  Then I went to grab a towel and take my luke warm at best shower  Well   the towel had a long black hair going down its entire length and I cringed  So I threw that one on the floor and grabbed another one and this one had part of a fake eyelash on it  I was beginning to freak out now being a germaphobe as it is  The last towel seemed acceptable and I had to use it but trust me I used it sparingly  I promptly called the front desk back this is SO unlike me but that was the last straw and the lady said they would have  sets of clean towels sent up she was very apologetic  If I had more time I would have just asked her to please get me a new room  Once those things were ironed out my stay was fine nothing great but no more issues arose  The water was hot the rest of my stay and I have to say the staff was very receptive and nice from check in to the above mentioned issues The only other thing is that I would have liked more outlets   I needed to iron each day and the only plug that I could find that was in easy reach was in the bathroom and it was very awkward ironing in the little foyer outside the bathroom  Beautiful flat screen TV   loved it  The beds were average   coworkers of mine also staying in the hotel said the sheets were not big enough for the bed and their feet were against mattress and hence they had to remake their beds  Luckily mine was not short sheeted I did not use any of the amenities of the hotel  The multi story lobby was OK  Overall I would say this hotel is in a great location but needs to be upgraded in a few major ways including bathrooms bedding and just general upkeep  I would stay again on business travel I suppose but certainly not on personal travel as it is pricey and I would certainly expect more for my money  
P => Needs a reation The service at the Hyatt is still very good  We called housekeeping a few times during our stay and they were always more than happy to oblige to our requests As for the room the bathroom definitely needs updating  The stone around the sink was cracked and the faucet was crooked and loose  The floor had spots on it and the grout was looking really old as well  There is barely any counterspace to place your toiletries as well The beds were comfortable and lots of pillow were provided which I liked  However the rooms are loud where you can hear water running through the pipes the TV on in the room next door and our toilet would randomly flush on its own  Also there was a mysterious pink spot on the carpet which was somewhat unappealing The location of the hotel is right by Michigan Avenue and all the shops as well as well known restaurants  This place is very very popular for meetings and conferences  During the later part of the week you have to wait a while for an elevator and oftentimes its full so you have to wait for another At  a night for the weekday I really think this hotel could use some updating  
P => Re design required Poor Value  Previous reviewers have used the words quottiredquot and quotolderquot for this property and I concur  However I was totally amazed at the appalling design of the place  Your limo taxi or bus drops you at the front entrance and then youre told that registration is on the next floor up the escalators  OK so they want to have shops and restaurant on the floor where you arrive but we had a room in the West Tower and every time we returned to the hotel it was to have to go up the escalator through the crowd at reception and then take the walkway to the West Tower  In the room the poor design continued   just two quot x quot drawers for my wife and I to unpack our belongings for a four day stay   I object to living out of my suitcase at the price they charge       the bathroom has a small shelf round the sink which does not have enough space for  washkits and a make up bag  It gets worse The toilet has a small shelf above it with the flush handle set back under the shelf   if you have a bad back as I do then expect to have to drop to your knees every time you want to flush     And worse still The container for the bathroom tissues is set into the side of the shelf above the toilet bowl so when the lid or seat is lifted they lean against the tissue box   obviously the bathroom designer was lacking in basic hygiene knowledgeWe were there for a convention and paying over  per night   NOT WORTH IT Previous reviewers talk of priceline and hotwire rooms around  to    thats probably the right range  You can get more space better layout free internet Hyatt is   per day at a great number of other hotel chains   well be staying somewhere other than the Hyatt Regency on our next trip to Chicago  
P => Mixed Feelings About a Tired Hotel We booked the hotel through a last minute travel offer via Northwest Airlines although the same deal was available through many other travel sites  The Hyatt Regency is huge and the majority of guests are there for conferences it seems  We were some of the only people there without nametags  We had a slight issue at checkin due to an upgraded room we ordered that was not available but it got straightened out eventually  The rooms really need refurbishing  The pictures Ive attached will show mildow in the bath but cant show the dust the dirty throw pillows and bad carpet  The bed was comfortable and the TV was fine but there was just a general quotoldquot feeling to the room  There was also too much noise from the halls and adjoining rooms but I think it was due to the more than  inch gap at the bottom of the doors  The location is excellent on E  Wacker between Michigan Av and Columbus  There is a grocery store  block south  The staff were friendly and competent  I might stay here again only if the price were really attractive but there are better hotels in Chicago for the price  
P => Great location Indeed its a huge corporate hotel but the location and hotwire rate  cant be beat Check in only took about  minutes so no complaints there The room was a bit small but fine for two people plus a great view of the Chicago River  It had all of the modern conveniences expected in a four star hotel  Shower temperature fluctuated a bit but nothing serious I didnt eat at the hotels restaurants  theres too many great restaurants in the city to eat at a hotel  but their offerings seemed ent from the menus My only complaint is the day parking fee expected for a big city but the city owned garage a few blocks south at Millennium Park is half the price and well worth it Above all if youre paying  for a night here you  be disappointed but for barely over  a night I was very happy  
P => Good for business not really for vacation I stayed at this hotel for a conference at McCormick Place  It was conveniently located but the parking was pricey good thing I didnt have a car and dining places are too  There are more relatively reasonable places nearby I just didnt realize it at first  It is a few blocks to the subwayelevated train station so that is convenient  There was also a taxi stand and shuttle available to the airports for a fee  The room itself was large and clean and the bathroom was ok the lack of a fan for moisture control and the buzzing of the only light were the minuses  I think it would be a little too busy of a hotel if I was looking for a place to crash while exploring Chicago  But for a nice place to chill during a business trip this is a great hotel  There is internet available a little area with internet access for a fee and a ton of other services that are probably too much for the casual traveller but are welcome during business trips  
P => Excellent service I just returned from staying at the Hyatt Regency for a convention and I was extremely impressed with the level of service displayed by every employee I encountered  From the employee at the snack bar who called me by name yes I was wearing a convention name badge but employees at other convention hotels rarely bother to notice to the room service attendant who walked me to the correct elevator when I asked how to get to the rooms in the West Tower to the maintenance man riding the elevator with me who asked if I was enjoying my stay I was treated like a valued guest at every turn  Management has clearly placed a priority on providing stellar service  The only downside was that a colleague of mine was placed in one of the smallest hotel rooms I have ever seen in a hotel of this type one double bed with a couple of feet of space around it and a shower stall with no bathtub  This was unfortunate as she was traveling with a large amount of equipment for the various presentations she gave at the conference  With all of her supplies unpacked amp spread out around the room she had to climb over the bed to get from one side of the room to the other  My room on the other hand was quite comfortably sized two double beds plenty of room to move around etc   So if you find yourself assigned to one of those shoebox sized rooms definitely ask if a larger room is available  Also be aware that if a convention is being held at the hotel the public areas of the hotel will be very busy and loud  Its great if you are one of the convention attendees because the Big Bar and other public areas are great spots for mingling with your cohorts but if you are traveling for leisure and looking for a relaxing experience try to avoid staying here when the hotel is hosting a convention  
P => Fine hotel great location We stayed at the Chicago Hyatt Regency for a week over Labor Day  It is a huge hotel but just follow the signs to get around  We used the CHECKIN service because we were arriving late evening  They gave us a room next to a service elevator which was noisy all night  We mentioned it to the front desk the next morning and they switched us to a very quiet room for the rest of the stay  The walls are quite thin and we could easily hear noise from the hallways but fortunately there was no activity in the hallways at night  The hotel is in a great location to get to the Mag Mile and to catch the El at StateLake and the  bus going to the Museums Science and Industry Field Shedd Aquarium etc  Were glad we didnt rent a car  parking fee is really high and its easy to get around if you dont mind walkingtaking public transit  There is a whole city in the Hyatt underground with barber fast casual eateries shoe repair even a florist  The free StayFit gym is open  hours and has a bunch of treadmills stair steppers and weightsresistance machines TIP Bockwinkels just  block south of the hotel has a nice deli and is good for groceries  
P => Above average stay  Great location  Stayed three nights for a conference  Gorgeous view of river and lake from West Tower  Very nice hotel with some subtle signs of aging in the rooms  Clean rooms and staff very friendly  Great location   lots of walkable attractions Recommend Volare for authentic italian food   walkable from the hotel Definetely would stay here again  
P => Will NEVER stay here again I stayed at this hotel for while in town for a conference  The first room I was assigned was a glorified conference room with a murphy bed and bad lighting  I switched rooms  The new room was fine although the bathroom was very small with little to no counter space and bad lighting again  What really makes this hotel bad are the doors to the rooms  There is no way to get them to shut quietly so throughout the night and early morning all I hear is doors slamming from people coming and going and they are not slamming their doors on purpose   they just make any incredibly loud noise  Plus the rooms are not well insulated for sound since I could hear convsersations running water etc  from all the surrounding rooms  
P => It Worked This was a good stay but nothing like what I might have expected  I used Hotwires Travel Ticker to book a room at  which comes to just under  after taxes  So for that amount of money be I shouldnt expect a lot  The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and beyond there being long lines at the elevator my boss and I always seemed to show up to get to our room when some conference was being released there was nothing negative about the stay  Still we usually stay at a Drury Inn whenever were on the road  I dont think anyones going to compare the Drury to the Hyatt but for  more there really wasnt much of a difference  Both the Drury and Hyatt have wonderful staffs and comfy beds and internet access  The difference is I get two free cocktails a night at the Drury along with some snacks a free hot breakfast free wireless and hard wired internet and parking  None of that for  more is included in the price at the Hyatt  Granted they are different hotels but for only staying one night I just didnt see much of a difference I didnt see what would make this Hyatt worth  more than the Drury in which I usually stay  Still it was comfortable  And I bet if I stayed longer than a night I wouldve noticed more about what was offered  
P => If you like drunks youll love the Hyatt Regency Chicago Heres some of what I witnessed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago during my three night stay A drunk woman vomiting in the middle of the lobby  A drunk woman yelling quotfirequot at  AM and slamming doors  This caused my neighbors to congregate in the hallway and talk loudly about calling security  A man essentially panhandling in the lobby  A drunk woman falling down on the escalator  Three drunk men pushing and showing each other in the elevator  They were Phillies fans so I assume this is just typical behavior for them lol Im no prude believe me but this was ridiculous  For whatever reason this hotel attracts people who cant hold their liquor and people who dont know how to behave in public  Honestly it was like something was in the water or the gin and this hotel became Ground Zero for the biggest congregations of drunks in Chicago Otherwise the hotel staff misquoted me on the price of the architectural boat tour that they helped book as well as the airport shuttle  In both cases staffers seriously under quoted the actual prices which caused me to unnecessarily question employees of other businesses  The room was very nice the location was great and the breakfast wasnt bad  Bar was expensive but what do you expect Hotel is huge so not great for people in a hurry or those who dont like long walks I wont stay here again because the vibe was too quotprom nightquot and the staffers cant get their info straight  
P => Good location very busy inside The Hyatt Regency is the largest hotel in Chicago and it definitely feels that way inside It has a true convention type of feel  Tons of people large crowds lots of hustle and bustle  However with all that said there was no line to check in to talk to concierge in the elevator or to check out  If youre just in and out of your room   the hotel is great  Location is wonderful next to Michigan Ave  Concierge was very helpful  The room was large and our view was beautiful  Id stay here again if we got the same good rate  
P => They will nickel and dime you til your pockets are empty Thank god I got this hotel through priceline  I cant imagine paying full price for this place The tub was moldy and dingy  The toilet didnt flush  Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least  Unless you wanted to pay  for a rerun of an NBC show Oh and internet Why that will set you back about  for the day And breakfast Thats about  for a cup of coffee a croissant and two slices of honeydew  This hotel is the pits  The customer service is    absent When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby ked out like some bad late s prom theres no one to direct you upstairs to the check in And once youre there check in is very fast ill grant them that This hotel is a big crummy rip off  I will never stay here and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe  
P => classy hotel good location I stayed at this hotel for one night after getting it through Priceline  The price I paid was excellent  We found as other reviewers that you can really hear a lot of noise from people in the hallway  This did not bother my sleep but I heard people in the evening and the morning  We were on the th floor of the West Tower at the end of the hall  It might be the doors more than the walls  We did not go into much of the hotel but enjoyed the room immensely  The beds were extremely comfortable and pillows too  The tv was a sizeable flat screen  I found the towels above average and very much enjoyed the soap shampoo  We had a great view out of the Wrigley tower and river area  Also our check in was the fastest I ever experienced  I barely got my last name out before he handed me the room key  I found the valet parking easy to work with too  Not cheap but you can drive back into the parking through the next day until  pm  I found out parking in Chicago is very expensive everywhere  It is  at the Hyatt  
P => Good Service Nice Room Yes this is priily a convention hotel and the busy noisy lobby attests to that but so what Our room was very nice and classy looking and the service at the front desk and by the concierge was very friendly and efficient  We were on one of the Regency Club levels which meant we received a complimentary buffet breakfast and late afternoon snacks  Its worth the extra  a day especially if theres more than two of you in the room  This is the quotcheaperquot of the two Hyatts in downtown Chicago  The big perk in the summertime is the free trolley service that stops right outside the front door and takes you to most of the attractions including Union Station  
P => Too Big Too Busy This is a convention hotel  It has its own large convention space underground so it is tailored around the conventioneers  As such during these times you have thousands of people conventioneers spouses business folks bustling around constantly  Even as a convention attendee I would have preferred staying at a quieter hotel in the area and there are certainly many to choose from The Hyatt is just plain big  Everything from the long queue for breakfast  to the over packed bar at night I found it overwhelmingly busy and crowded  The staff was very friendly and certainly tried to provide personal attention but the whole atmosphere lacks personality The room was fine  Mine was night  Everything was clean and modern  Flat panel TV was nice  Bed was comfortable bathroom was very good  The room had plenty of space with a small couch and seating area  On the th floor I had a terrific view  Internet access is day which always annoys me when expensive hotels charge and there is no wireless Location is excellent easy walk to Navy Pier Millennium Park Magnificent Mile and lots of restaurants If I had been on vacation I would never want to get cht up in such a convention atmosphere  If I was staying there when there wasnt a convention going on it might be more relaxing but Im still not a fan of giant hotels like this  There are lots of great hotels in Chicago  If you are part of the convention and dont mind bustling hotels then youll be fine  But if you are there on your own or you just like something a little more personable Id look around  You can do better  
P => Nice Hotel Stayed for a few nights on a late spring getaway with my wife  We were warmly greeted by the person checking us in and he was able to get us a room with a partial lake view  The room was nice comfortable bed large TV and a nice table with  chairs in front of the window  The view looked out over the river and Navy Pier which made for a nice place to take afternoon breaks  The bathroom was nice but nothing special    they could stand to update them with nicer counters sinks and tubs  Overall a great place to stay 
P => Didnt really care for this hotel overall I too was in town for a journalism conference and stayed at this hotel  It was one of six quotofficialquot hotels for the convention  I paid way too much per night for what I got and I am not happy about that  I most likely wont stay there again The lobby was busy from the jump but I expected that so that was no problem  There were other conventionsconferences in town so that was cool A woman who worked there helped me check into our room via the express check in kiosk which was very efficient  I appreciated her help  Check out was efficient too using that kiosk Before I even entered my room however I noticed chipped paint on the door which signaled a place in need of repair  I wasnt prepared for that since the pics on the Web site showed an updated maintained room  My suspicions about the room were confirmed upon walking in  Just want you to know that the rooms are old with feeble attempts to make them look modern  The view wasnt great and I wasnt feeling a number of things including the dim lighting in the bathroom which remained even after I complained to the front desk about it the lack of real counter space in the bathroom a lack of an exhaust fan in the bathroom a coffee maker that allows you to make a single cup of coffee or tea one at a time paper cups for the coffee or tea and the fact that you can hear way more noise from your neighbors than you really want to  My roommate complained that she heard way too much of a conversation between two women who were in their hotel room  So much for privacy The lamp shades were awful  One nightstand lamp was scratched up and paint was missing  The alarm clock held up the lamp shade before I moved it  And the lamp shade of the floor lamp near my roommates bed was old and caved in  It didnt even give off a good light  The drawer space was awful so dont bring a lot of clothes unless you plan on putting some of them on the floor or leaving them in your suitcase  The hair dryer was on the closet shelf as if it was an afterthought  Why wasnt it in the bathroom where it belonged is beyond me The cable stations seriously lack variety which I didnt expect  I should be able to at least watch HGTV and Bravo  Yes I expected that for what I paid to stay there Truly the highlights of the room were the iHome alarm clock that allowed me to dock my iPod the very comfortable beds and a nice powerful shower  I also enjoyed the coffee downstairs that I bought at Js  One good thing is that the hotel is close to many good restaurants Magnificent Mile the Navy Pier and so much more  Just a warning Avoid ordering room service if you can  I paid  dollars for two orders of wings and an order of fries  If you do order in count on paying taxes gratuity and a delivery service charge  My  or so order skyrocketed in no time with all those charges added  I dont have a problem with paying taxes or gratuity  But when folks start adding a service charge on top of the gratuity its just suspect  Case in point Eat out whenever you can and bring it back to your room This place is ok if you want a good shower a comfortable bed and access to the best that Chicago has to offer  But keep in mind that youre paying for all that perhaps more than you  want to  They arent doing you any favors If this were the Motel  it would have been great  Perfect even But at  a night for five nights I expected way more than I got  And  a night was the conference rate  Yeah  I wont be staying there again  
P => Mold in the bathroom lack of attention to details ruined the hotel Having stayed in the West Tower of this hotel  years ago I was shocked about the condition of my room in the East Tower this time  At first glance the hotel room was ent with a reasonable view overlooking the river  However the hotel has not paid attention to details resulting in a Hyatt Regency that felt more like a lower level chain hotel  Bad Qualities The most glaring issue is the extensive mold in the tubshower  In fact it was so disgusting that I didnt want to put the soap down in the bathroom  There was an outlet cover in the bathroom that was hanging on by a thread which immediately fell down when I closed the door  Spider webs covered the sprinklers  Multiple holes were in the wall  The beds were rather hard and uncomfortable  The toiletries were cheap  And the most annoying issue with the hotel was that we could not cool down the room While the digital scale would go to   it never actually got below ish on the best day  This seems to be a growing cost saving trend with high end hotels these days which in my opinion is eptive Good Qualities There were tons of pillows The food was reasonably priced  The sticky bun french toast was pretty good  The alarm clock has a docking station for iPods  The staff on all levels were very friendly and helpful  The location is ent between the park and the shopping district While this hotel is not horrible I dont plan on staying here again unless they considerable improve their attention to detail  Right now the hotel is more a night room instead of a night hotel  
P => Mixed Opinions on Hyatt on Wacker I was just there for a  day stay during a journalism convention Price of Room    Thank God I split the cost with a friend Room   It was small but cozy Beds    very comfortable Bathroom   Shampoos were cheap and not very good  Towels were fine  Bathroom had no fans so it became a sauna  View   It was fine  Bars   Uh can we say OVER PRICED drinks  Restaurants   I didnt try themWorkout Room   Horrible  They had about  machines treadmills etcs side by side and dinky little weight area  Lets just say it was no  star workout room  They dont care for us to workout because you can see they invest more in the bar that workout room  The worstFront Desk Personnel   Very friendly patient and helpful  I never saw anyone without a smile  They made it very pleasant Thats my rundown of the place  Would I go back Probably  The location was perfect  You can walk anywhere and feel safe  Great restaurants close by and a taxi can take you anywhere  The weather was perfect and the lake is nearby for a good walk  
P => Quite Happy With The Hotel We spent two nights in late y in the Hyatt  As stated this is a very big and very busy convention hotel and I suspect the main lobby is seldom quiet  However we found the hotel to be pleasant overall  We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning as our flight arrived early  The nice young man at the desk attempted to find us a room this was at am that was ready but was unable to do so  He advised that our cell phone would be called as soon as one was ready so we checked our bags with the bell stand and went out to have breakfast  Later in the morning about  our room was ready  As we were waiting on the elevator in the lobby the same desk clerk walked by remembered our names and asked which room we had been assigned  We told him our room and he was very pleased and said he had wanted to get us in that room which was a corner view room  Nice service and gave a food first impression of the hotel Our room was in the west tower on a high floor and had a great view of the river and downtown Chicago  The room had a king sized bed and was in good shape and seemed to be very clean  The housekeeping staff kept it that way our whole visit  The only thing I would fault the room for was the lack of a fridge we could use for own things  There is a mini bar but we were warned that if we moved anything to make room for our own items we would be charged for it electronic monitor of the goods  So we just left the mini bar alone and used ice from ice machine to ice down things  The room also had an electronic safe which is a nice touch  Overall we happy with the room the location and the housekeeping  Location of the hotel is good for access to all the attractions of downtown Chicago  We did not have a car so no parking fee issues for us but I would hate to pay the rates they wanted  We only had one meal in the hotel lunch one day at Bistro   We found the food to be good the service pretty good and the prices no worse than we had paid in other places we ate outside of the hotel  Overall we give this hotel a good rating as we felt the service was excellent and the room was nice  Again it is big busy and the main lobby is noisy and constantly in use  However that is to be expected in a big convention hotel such as this one  
P => Great view but otherwise unimpressive My husband attended a conference here and I tagged along with my college age dhter who attends school in the Chicago area  I think my dhter nailed it when she described the lobby as looking like an airport  It felt that way too   crowded poorly laid out and I felt like I was being processed  The front desk service was friendly but a couple of times we were steered in the wrong direction for services by the bell desk and whoever was manning the phones  The hotel or looks cheap and is poorly designed both aesthetically and ergonomically  Our room wasnt very clean to start with dust on the radio and woodwork but the daily maid service wasnt the greatest either   our beds were haphazardly thrown together with a pillow left on the floor  And the beds are doubles rather than queens  One of the beds linens had holes in it Valet parking is really expensive at  a day especially for a hotel of this caliber  Another annoyance is that you cant park your own car so you feel obligated to tip in addition to paying the daily rate  They nickle and dime you with internet charges and mini bar usage charges as other reviewers have noted  On the plus side the location is really convenient and the view from our room was beautiful overlooking the river with views to Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  I can think of no other reasons why I would want to stay at this hotel ever again  There are so many other lovely hotels in the area  I couldnt believe that this property had earned a  diamond award   perhaps thats why I found it hard to overlook things that I would be more forgiving of in a lesser property  My guess is that Hyatt feeds off their conference clients so they really dont give a rip about their guests because they basically have a steady stream of conference attendees instead of customers who would actually choose to stay there  
P => There is nothing elegant about this hotel  There is nothing elegant about this hotel  the lobby is less tasteful and more trammeled than the average shopping mall  In fairness other than the mega hotels in Las Vegas Hyatt Regency Chicago HRC is one of the biggest hotels in the country  You will wait in line for most things and calling the switchboard is like calling an airline  press  for X press  for Y  Rooms are small though the desk agent quotupgradedquot us to a room on the top floor with river skyline and lake views  still hard to believe some pay  a night for this room that gets swallowed up by the king bed  Positives  the beds are comfy and the soap is nice  LIke the curved shower rod  Then again internet is ridiculously priced at  per  hours     and it didnt even work well they rebated it for me  If youve got a car youll pay  plus tax to park per night     Location a block off Michigan Avenue is an asset as is the well maintained nicely appointed fitness center  free to guests  All the same only stay here if you get a great deal on Priceline  I got an  rate  or if you are staying for a convention     and then dont eat there  
P => Great Hotel I was very worried about staying at this hotel after reading many of the reviews on this website  However I was very impressed after staying here  The check in was simple and very helpful  The concierge helped us find our way to IKEA and was very pleasant  Whenever we passed an employee in the hallway they would smile and say hello  The location was perfect for shopping on Michigan Ave  We couldnt have gotten a better price than we received on priceline    MUCH below the asking price of the hotels website  We would stay here again anytime 
P => Hated this place Stayed in this hotel for work conference  Lots of conferences booked  this place is so big that it is overwhelming  yet there are very few employees to be found  Very long lines and wait at elevators  also waited more than  minutes on hold to book a wake up call  room very dark and air conditioning did not work well  I would never stay here again  
P => No Complaints I just stayed here as part of a conference and was very pleased  It is a large hotel with several options for eating and drinking including the quotBIG barquot with its great view and cool lighting  My room was very clean comfortable and modern  I had a great view of the river from the th floor  It is right across the street from thre RiverWalk and  block from Michigan Ave      a very easy walk  The theatre district is within walking distance as is Garretts Popcorn and Macys the former shalls Fields store  The staff seemed very helpful and willing to answer questions  I have no complaints and would stay here again  
P => ONLY ONE WAY TO STAY IN THIS HOTEL  I had a tough time iding where to stay in Chicago after going through all the numerous reviews here and looking at websites  This Hyatt was not in my top choices  Then I found a special deal for concierge floor  For   a night I got a th floor beautiful beautiful king bed room with a gorgeous gorgeous view of Lake Michigan  The room was beautifully orated and had upscale furnishings  I had all day access to the lounge plus a great free full buffet breakfast down in the lobby daily  This is the ONLY way to stay here  Your calls are answered immediately and everything is done to accomodate you  Plus you have free internet in the lounge  Other than that   the lobby is like Grand Central Station   the check in desks are swamped with lines and lines of people  The people responsible for our luggage lost track of where it was and out of frustration I went down and brought it up myself after an hour  The front of the hotel was as crowded as the lobby with very ill mannered loud and boisterous people  When we first pulled up we wanted to turn around and go elsewhere  It does cost   a day to park with in and out access  Quite a lot   even for Chicago  But on the th floor   it was peaceful quiet pretty and clean   we felt like we were in a completely different hotel  I would NEVER EVER stay in this hotel unless I was able to book a deal like this again  
P => Overall Great Value Had another great stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago this past y th Weekend I received a real good rate of  through hotwire com As always this Hyatt hotel is full of energy and excitement  I love the look and feel of the hotel and the contemporary or of the rooms  My room was nice and clean and the staff was always upbeat and friendly  Its a huge hotel consisting of two towers  The only drawbacks there is no complimentary internet access in the rooms and to purchase internet access will cost a whopping  per day  Valet parking is  per day but thats in step with the average going rate for that area Its located within walking distance of large selection of shopping venues and restaurants as well as a nice little convenience store just a few feet from the hotel  The bar Big Bar just off the lobby is a great hangout place at night One of my travel partners stayed at Hotel  just a few doors down from the Hyatt  The rooms in this hotel are also very nice with a contemporary or  However the overall feel of the hotel is a bit on the dreary side as hip as the place makes an attempt to be  The elevators are ridiculously extreeeeeeemly slow And there are nowhere near enough elevators to service that amount of floors  But they do have a complimentary business center for use by all of its customers and complimentary in room internet access as well  
P => Would Not Stay Again     While on convention with the American Federation Teachers I was booked at the Chicago Hyatt Regency  It was the pits  The problems are numerous  The problems began upon arrival when the keys for our room was not ready  I waited for several hours for the key to be ready after normal check in time   Once in the room I thought I would put my clothes in the drawers only to find that there really is no storage space for clothing if you are staying longer than a day  I was there for five days  Of course the small refrigerator is already full and is monitored by weight  Therefore if you happen to put something in and then take it out it registers as a purchase  There is one night stand that is taken up by the clock the phone and the notepad  Forget using it for personal items  There was also no mirror in the room   There is a mirror in the bathroom but if someone is using the bathroom then the other person has to wait  And the mirror that is in the bathroom is not full length  Forget trying to place personal toiletries on the vanity in the bathroom  There is no space for that either  While I am writing about the bathroom I cant leave out the horrible lighting  The only light source is above the sink  While I was in the shower I was practically in the dark   While relaxing in the evenings my roommate and I tried to find something entertaining to watch on TV  Our search was futile  There are two premium channels HBO and Disney  There is OnDemand      for a fee and even that is limited   The hotel is located in an area that is walking distance to some points of interest  I thought most of the the staff were friendly and accommodating  If I had my choice I would not stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel  
P => Great price   Great Value We booked this hotel via a Priceline bid and stayed here over the busy y th holiday weekend  Our rate was  a night so we got a great deal considering the date location and quality of the hotel  We stayed in the east tower and the room appeared to have been reated sometime recently as it was relatively modern and in great shape  We received great service from the folks at the front desk upon check in and found the valet folks to be extremely helpful and relatively quick throughout the stay  It was a good pick from us at a great location  
P => Loved it Went on a Chicago adventure with a group of friends and ended up at the Hyatt with a great rate through Hotwire  This is the most upscale hotel Ive stayed in and it was great  The front desk attendants were helpful in informing us on the local pizza places and bus transport  We intended on shopping on the Mag Mile so this was probably our best choice  Internet and TV is expensive as well as room service but we had a great busy weekend otherwise  I would love to stay here again  
P => Haunted plumbing I was there for a  person conference  I had to pay  hrs for internet access  In the lobby at the quotfreequot use computers it was  hr for internet access  There is a note on their site stating that there is a fee for access however its burried deep and the actual fee is not listed Parking was  night which I understand is the going rate downtown I still thought it was extreme The worst part  for me  was the banging pipes  They have a water hammer problem and whenever someone closed a water valve shower toilet sink the pipes would bang  I was hearing the rooms four floors above and four floors below me Many of my conference mates toilets wouldnt flush  Liquids would go down solids would not  
P => Nice but impersonal A friend and I stayed here when we were in Chicago to do some sightseeing and go to a concert  I got a room for  on Hotwire which I think was a great deal I got what I expected from such a large hotel  a clean comfortable room but a very busy staff who seemed in a hurry to move on to the next person  We ate elsewhere but I did like that there was a Starbucks right in the hotel The room was somewhat small but comfortable with modern furniture a very nice bathroom and a flat screen TV  I slept very well but my friend had problems because shes allergic to down and all the pillows and comforter were down  She did find a pillow she could use in the closet though The front desk clerk tried to talk me into paying an extra  for a room with a scenic view but our room overlooked the river and downtown anyway so dont be fooled into paying moreOverall the hotel is centrally located and comfortable but Im not sure Id pay full price for it  
P => Incredible View I absolutely adored my room at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago  The view was incredibly amazing  The hotel is in a very convenient location  Great choice when visiting the Chicago area  
P => Love the location of this Hyatt I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago for  nights while attending a professional conference in Chicago  I was very pleased overall and would stay there again  They have a great location on the Chicago river convenient to the Magnificent Mile and all of its wonderful shopping  The room was clean and the workspace was good with plenty of power outlets  The carpet needs updating and was a little grubby  The bathroom was clean but dimly lit  It included a lighted make up mirror which is always a nice touch  There was plenty of hot water  Housekeeping did a nice job  The bed was quite comfortable The staff was friendly and helpful  I totally goofed and locked my carry on bag in my room after I checked out  They were very quick to give me a temporary key when I told them my shuttle to OHare was leaving in  minutes I ate at one restaurant in the hotel Pronto Mamas and it was adequate  I wouldnt go back but it was a satisfying meal after a long day of delayed flights and shuttles stuck in traffic A couple of Chicago restaurant recommendations both by cab from the Hyatt Tavern on Rush and Bistro   
P => Spectacular view great location The Hyatt Regency in Chicago is in a great central location  The views from rooms facing the river and the Wrigley building are spectacular day and night  The beds at Hyatt hotels are always so very comfortable That said I was disappointed in this Hyatt from the moment we checked in  There was no welcome attitude or hint of a smile from Rachel working the front desk at check in  The concierge staff often gave us misinformation or were uninformed about sites and events in Chicago  We got our best info from cab drivers  But my biggest complaint is the hotel just seems run down  Chairs throughout the hotel are worn torn and stained  Brass railings in the lobby were very dirty  Big white billowy cloth or hanging over the Bistro were covered in layers of dust  There were quotstainedquot sheets on our bed  The rooms and bathrooms are darkly orated with low watt lighting  And the spiders inside and outside the window of room  were creepy  This hotel needs a good cleaning or remodel and turn up the lights for crying out loud  Be the  star hotel you advertiseDid I say the view was spectacular Get out and see the great City of Chicago there is so much to do  Just dont spend too much time in your room  We loved this city just not the Hyatt  
P => Plenty of Better Alternatives The location is great  Within walking distance of most attractions However the great thing is there are plenty of hotels in the same price range in this area with much better customer service The hotel staff is obnoxiously rude  The concierge was not well educated on local attractions  The first two nights I called to request a room change because the room above had a running toilet that I got to hear all night  Nothing was done about it until night   I was refused a room change due to quotwe are overbookedquot  They day of checkout I was told I would be required to pay  for a late checkout  I asked for the manager and explained the issues while I had stayed there and that I thought an extra charge for a few hours was not fair  After some debate he agreed The configuration of King room I had was odd and uncomfortable  The headboard was against the bathroom wall as you entered and the foot was toward the window  However the dresser was in the typical location  Try watching TV from bed with a quot flat screen  feet from your face on the left side of the bed  Very odd and uncomfortable The room service was great Fast and tasteful 
P => Loved the Hyatt We paid  a night through Priceline which is excellent for e  Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river  The room was large clean and had a couch easy chair and desk chair  The bedding was the newer non bedspread style the bed was comfortable the bathroom was large and well we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way We ate at the lobby restaurant which is attractively orated and was bustling with activity when we were there  We only got Cobb Salads so I dont know if the food in general is good or not  The Cobb was so so Our only complaint was the  fee to park your car over night and the  daily fee for the internet  Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept We hated to leave 
P => Great hotel busy during large events The hotel is in the area known as quotThe Loopquot  Its a fair distance away from most of the touristey attractions so plan on walking a lot or using bussescabstrainscars  Its not too far from the Navy Pier  Mellinium Park is only a few blocks away There are two buildings and three ways to get between them  The first and most obvious way is to cross the street Stetson  The second is via the skybridge  Third is underground  This underground connection is part of the Chicago Pedway  The Pedway is an invaluable resource to walking around Chicago The elevators get really slow when a lot of people use them  There are erate elevators for the housekeeping staff as well as for food staff room service  We used one of the food staff elevators almost exclusevly and never met another staff member The room was quite modern and comfortable even with  people in a double queen room  We were surprised to find an almost brand new quot plasma bolted to the front table  We discovered that the TV could change channels and also to the PC input  So bring a VGA cable not DVI though and you can use your laptop on the big screen  Very cool  We noticed that not all of the rooms had been upgraded yet many still had quot CRT televisions  Also iHome docks are standard in all rooms  The particular model they had features an auxilary input for non iPods  This can also plug directly into the headphone jack on your laptop which helps tremendously as most laptops have rather quiet speakers Wireless internet is terribly expensive  We got lucky though  We stayed in the East tower in the room to the most southeast  Just outside our room is a window which looks directly south  Directly south of the hotel is an apartment complex  Of the dozens of access points we could pick up one was open  We also walked around the hotel with a laptop and found a few other open access points mostly on the blue level  
P => Nice Location and Room I recently stayed at this hotel for a business conference  Although the hotel is not close to the convention center they did provide a shuttle that had a special route to the convention center  The location of the hotel is convenient to many of the downtown attractions  It is a little further out than the riott or Intercontinental but most everything was in walking distance as long as you dont mind walking a couple blocks The hotel is very big so service is not extremely personal  My room was on the nd floor and I had very nice views of the city  I liked the unique layout of my room  It was very clean and maid service was efficient and thorough The only issues would be slow elevators at peak times again very big hotel and slower response when I called the operator and front desk  I would stay here again but if possible would prefer to stay at a hotel right on Michigan avenue  
P => Service above expectations for such a large hotel From the moment we arrived the staff at the Hyatt Regency Chicago set the tone for a great weekend with their courtesy and friendliness We were greeted by name with each encounter and truly felt genuine warmth from each staff member  The lobby is very large but we were able to find a little nest at the Big Bar for a welcome cocktail  loved the atmosphere and the view  We had requested a room with a view but the certificates we redeemed were not for that room level  We were told it would be available for an extra   no problem and well worth it  The view of the river and the lake were spectacular from the st floor  Be sure to draw the curtains  that summer sun was up well before we wanted to beSince the room was so comfortable we opted for room service each morning  It was delivered within  minutes and was above expectations  We attended the Blues Festival and it was an easy walk to Grant and Millennium Parks from the hotel  There were many dining options within a few blocks so there was little need to take the car but when we did the valet service was fast and accommodating  At  per day with in and out privileges it was a bargain for this city  My only slight negative was that when we called the concierge at pm for a late night dinner recommendation nearby she drew a blank and referred us to room service  SO NOT TRUE Since I grew up in Chicago I knew there were options so we let the Net direct us instead  Smith amp Wolensky has service until am in their lower level Grill  a  block walk down Wacker Drive  Any cab driver can assist you as well if you feel adventurous  Since I like to read reviews before I make my choices and have enjoyed your comments here both good and bad I hope that this review will help you and I wish you a great stay in Chicago 
P => Very Nice Stay in Chicago We booked our  night stay through Hyatt com and got a rate of night  The location is great    we walked almost everywhere  We took a cab to Gibsons excellent mini sliders but walked back to the hotel  The hotel staff was very helpful and our room was very clean and comfortable  The day we checked out a convention at the hotel was beginning  The lobby and common areas of the hotel were a little congested but that really didnt bother us  One nice thing the Hyatt still does is hold your luggage at the bell stand for no additional cost except a tip  I have noticed that some hotels are now charging for this service  Easy access to public transportation so a car is not necessary  We loved our visit to Chicago and the hotel was definately a positive 
P => Nice place to stay if price is right I expected a little bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago   a bit more  Star and a little bit more from the rooms  It were the little things that made the difference Negatives   stayed on th floor of West Tower at the end of the hall but could easily hear people outside of the door gap under door of  quot  could make out the television program bathroom habits and discussions of the people in next room  happily they were not amorous  the toilet was very low flow and had to be flushed twice and the towels were thin not plush and no robe was in the room  cattle call check in and service in most areas it was very busyPositives  nice tv but not hi def  great location for sight seeing or business or both  comfortable bedsIf you can get a great HotwirePriceline deal I would recommend this hotel but at  convention rate it was not worth it  
P => Another pleasant stay Stayed in room  in early e for  nights  Stayed in the quotmainquot tower this trip but have stayed in the other on a previous trip  The room was very fresh with a partial view of the river  Has all the usual amenities and furnishings of a Hyatt  The staff was friendly and helpful  Agree with other posters that the eating options are high   a bagel was  at the self serve and   at Starbucks up the street  The conference rate was not a bargain but on previous stay got a great rate on Hotwire  Location is certainly great  I walked up the Magnificant Mile to  Michigan stores back down along the lake and then up the river walk  Had lunch at the Park Cafe looking straight up at the quotbeanquot and then walked down to the Art Institute  Bottom line great location comfortable room friendly staff and can be a good value I would stay again  
P => Its just a Hyatt The Hyatt is the Hyatt  I have been staying there on and off for more than  years  The hotel is well run clean and well managed but its nothing special when compared to other upscale hotels in Chicago I know  I commute to Chicago every week and have done so for the past year and a half  Ive stayed in dozens of different hotels My room was a queen and very small  The staff person who helped me use the kiosk check in devices knew that and mentionned it to me as soon as he saw the room number  quotYes its not the king you were hoping for and the room is smaller than most it does have a great view quotThe view was ent   a partial shot of the Chicago River and many other high rises   but not great I guess I shouldnt complain though  I booked through Hotwire and got a very reasonable price so its not unexpected that I wouldnt get an quotAquot room  On other trips I received rooms that were quite spectacular  I guess it depends on the occupancy The room was comfortable and clean  Only a stand up shower so if you are a bath person make sure you ask when you check in I do not eat or drink in any of the restaurants at the Hyatt  They are very expensive and the food is only average at best  There are many close by restaurants that guests can walk to that have better food and are more reasonably priced  I was only there for one night this trip so I didnt use any of the other ammenities The new check in kiosks actually took longer to use then stepping up to the counter but that could have been quotuser errorquot  Im guessing when the lines are long the kiosks will be a welcome opportunity to check in and as I get more proficcient the processing will be faster  As mentionned there was a staff person there assisting  he was very helpful and knowledgeable Two pet peeves about this hotel   no free wifi and they wont let you use your frequent stay number if you book through Hotwire  I get why they do that and dont expect credit for a discounted room but at least by using your number you could get a free paper in the morning and at least be recognized as a Gold Passport member  I always mention that to management but one person isnt going to change their business model Overall the hotel was fine and I would recommend it if you can get a good rate  Its close to Mag Mile nightlife and restaurants and shopping  Also convenienet to many modes of transportation   the quotLquot both airports and Metra trains to the Burbs as an example  
P => Hotel OK Service above average I have stayed at this hotel many years ago and I must say not too much has changed  One exception though the hotel has excellent service which can make up for its average design and looks  The hotel has several good restaurants with a great breakfast buffet and an awesome gym  
P => Excellent Hyatt I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago for  nights in   while attending a conference  I had a room on the th floor overlooking the hotel atrium facing E  Wacker  The room included a sofa and a comfortable chair as well as a desk chair  The bed was comfortable  Each room has a plasma TV  quot  Each room has an iPod dock  The room was a very nice size as was the bathroom  The hotel is in a very good location within walking distance to shopping museums and restaurants I tend to favor Hyatts and overall I was very pleased with my stay  
P => Excellent Location   But Is It Necessary This is a conference hotel priily  The property is huge so its easy to get lost  At  per night parking its far better to take public transportation or even taxis to get around town  I love Chicago and the hotels location was good for walking and shopping  However you can get around town fairly easily without having to shell out hundreds of dollars per night plus all the overpriced extras at this hotel  The hotel has a vibrant profit center from its conference facilities so unless youre here for a conference its not worth the money to stay here  
P => Bring earplugs to this beautiful hotel We stayed here on Saturday night the beginning of the National Restaurant Association convention which brings  people to Chicago  We had booked for two people on Priceline and I know from previous stays that some Hyatt Regencys wont put rollaways into some of their rooms  We solved the problem by using   CHECKIN  I think you  have to join their free Passport Club to use this service  You can call this number the day of your stay any time and get your room blocked out for you on the phone at that time  The woman on the phone assured me that this would get me a better room that using the front desk  They put us in a room with a pullout sofa in the East Tower with a beautiful view of the Park  The room was very clean and comfortable but the noise in the hall is all too clearly audible  I actually heard the person dropping the morning newspapers in front of doors  Alas this did not mean he was in front of my door  We were on a road trip and had a fan but without it it would have been a very noisy night as people in the hall and the above mentioned staffer were clearly audible even above the fan  The staff is incredibly polite and helpful just who I would want to have if I had a problem  Park elsewhere   the garage was  a night  
P => FILTHY and DIRTY I first noticed the filth when I went to turn on the airfan in the bedroom  The dust on the vent was  inch thick  There were crumbs in the dresser drawers  There was  inch of dust on the floor boards on the door stopper in the bathroom and on the sprinkler in the bathroom  The bathroom door was splattered with God only knows what There was mold in the bathroom and the bathroom wallpaper was stained and splattered   The remote control and TV were not working properly so I called for maintenance  The maintenance person arrive and asked me about my stay so far and I told him about the room  He called the quotExceptional Stayquot department who was to come and touch up the room while I was out for the evening  I arrived back to the room rather late and noticed that I had some new towels but that was about it  Nothing else looked as though it had been touched  The repairman had fixed the remote for the TV but by the next evening it no longer worked properly  I spoke to the manager at the front desk about my experiences and she offered to move me to another room and promised to have a bell hop up to my room in  minutes to help me with the move  Over a half hour later I moved myself because no one showed up  The new room wasnt much better only this one not only had mold on the ceiling in the shower but had mold on the shower curtain too  It was far too late at night to do anything about it so I was stuck there for a second night  I was disgusted  The next morning I secured a room at The Hard Rock Hotel before checking out    which was beautifully clean A collegue stayed at quotClub Quartersquot also nearby and said the prices were great and the rooms were clean  if a bit on the small side   I would never consider staying at that Hyatt again  The one upside was that the Hyatt only charged me for one of the two nights  But they should probably not have charged me at all  Im shocked at the housekeeping practices there  I was kicking myself for not bringing a camera on this trip  I noticed that others have reported good experiences at the Hyatt and Im just stunned  I am the director of a department where I work and from that perspective if I were the management at the Hyatt the entire housekeeping staff would be fired  All I can add is that I stayed in the East Tower and be the West Tower is nicer  I had a reduced rate because of an affiliation with the university and be thats the reason I was given two poor quality rooms  But for  per night I expect far more  
P => Fabulous Location My husband and I stayed here a week in il  We were travelling with work and the costs did not come out of our pocket  If they had we would have found some prices high  Wireless internet is day room service is   delivery fee plus   mandatory gratuity plus inflated meal prices If you are travelling for pleasure and can forego internet and room service I recommend the Hyatt Regency  Heres why  Fabulous location  It is right in between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop  Easy walk to Navy Pier Millenium Park Art Institute Macys waterfront river tours and TONS of restaurants   Comfortable and clean beds linens and rooms pictures already posted by others reflect our room and bathroom very well   Free gym  The gym is rather small but it has bikes ellipticals weights free and machine televisions and treadmills   Great concierge service   always friendly always available TIPS FOR TRAVELLERS  Ask for an upper floor room   you will get a good view of either downtown the Mag Mile the river or the lake   Ask for a fridge  They might give you one for free though their officlal policy is to charge   There is a huge grocery store called Dominicks very close to the hotel  Ask the concierge for directions   If travelling via air Take the quotGoquot Shuttle from OHare   it will bring you straight to hotel for  one way  round trip  Discounts for groups BOTTOM LINE if you can forego the small hotel feel and stay in a HUGE and impersonal complex this is a fabulous downtown location with a comfortable clean and good sized room good concierge service and lots of amenities nearby  
P => Perfect for the price Booked for  on Priceline  Room was King Bed Lobby was busy but there was a convention staying at the hotel  Staff was nice and courteous  The bathroom from other units was audible and the hallway wall seemed thin but it never woke me up We werent in the room much but the location was great if you are in town for a sightseeing weekend like we were  Few blocks from the StateLake L stop that put you on a few different lines  
P => Loved it This comes a little late as Im finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late ober  for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town  This hotel is perfect IMO  Easy check in and check out  Lovely clean comfortable rooms with great views of the city  I know this area pretty well and its very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions  We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St   We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and theres even public transportation right near by but we didnt bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel  Parking as is usual for Chicago was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly however we left on a Sunday morning not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day so a bit busier than usual I would think  No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of  through Hotwire a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel  
P => Great location great place to stay I just returned from a  night weekend stay at the Hyatt Regency  After reading all of the negatives that were previously posted I was skeptical  However we thoroughly enjoyed out stay  It is a large hotel and the lobby is busy but thats because they have lovely public areas with lots of room for lots of people  We were in the East Tower the main one on the rd floor with a view of the Chicago River and a peak at the lake  It was gorgeous and we enjoyed coming back to our room each night to enjoy the view when it was all lit up  We had a king room and while it was not very big it was certainly adequate for what we needed  The bathroom was a nice size with lovely amenities  Theres a coffee bar in the lobby that serves Starbucks and you can get pastry fruit etc  is youre on the run  If you walk out of the hotel and turn left and go about a block and a half straight theres a Corner Bakery that is great and inexpensive for breakfast  Anything from pastries to full breakfasts  The Hyatt Regency is in an excellent location for sightseeing  We were only about  blocks from the Mag Mile and we walked to the Art Institute Millenium Park and several other places  Cabs are easy to find so for   or so you can cab it if its too far to walk  My only criticism of the Hyatt is that there is virtually no drawer space in the room  They stuck a makeshift small chest in the closet but if you have a lot of clothes that you want to unpack theres almost no place to put them unless you hang them in the closet  We just hung up what we could and left the rest in our luggage  Not a big deal  All in all wed stay there again and recommend it  
P => Not bad for the price and location I stayed here recently to attend a conference at the hotel so it was convenient  The hotel itself is a little outdated in the lobby area but the room I had on the nd floor was mostly updated so was a pleasure to stay in  The layout with the desk area running behind the bed was an efficient and attractive design  The bed was very comfortable  My room had a great view of Lake Michigan The layout of the hotel was a bit sprawling with long corridors to get from the lobby to my tower  The location of the hotel on East Whacker was very nice  So stay here if the price is right for you and the location works but dont stay here for a premium hotel experience  Im sure there are better hotels for that  
P => Great staff excellent location but a bit worn around the edges     This big ole Hyatt is in a great location in the loop  I stayed on the st floor of the west tower  this hotel is BIG  over  rooms  the staff is excellent   they really went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable  here are some things i dont like about the property  old hotel and it feels it   way too big for its own good  nd floor of the west tower has a few barrestaurants that make you feel like your in penn station NYC    they charge  per nite for in room wifi   that is a rip off  they charge a  quotconnection feequot to dial a toll free number   that is a rip off  the minibar prices are a comedy     for a bottle of fiji water  the coffee bar on the ground floor charges  for a scone when starbux and any good bakery would charge less  this is not a ballpark or an airport   this is a rip off the room was clean there was a docking station for my ipod and there was a nice big flat panel tv  would i stay here again   NO  but you could do worse     
P => Great for the price ideal location  My husband and I booked a three night stay at this hotel through Priceline  We got it for  which I thought was pretty ent  The hotel is in a great location downtown very close to Navy Pier and right off Michigan Ave  We were able to walk everywhere   from the Sears Tower to the State Street shops to the Museum CampusOur check in and check out went very smoothly the staff was always polite and friendly  We didnt eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel or order room service as it was extremely overpriced   even for Chicago This hotel is huge and it was full of conference attendees but I never felt crowded and we never had trouble getting to or from our room on the st floor The room itself was pretty nice quite large  Ive stayed downtown for a similar price and the room was barely large enough to fit the bed The Hyatts room had a king bed two nightstands the TV stand  desk a couch and coffee table with plenty of room to move around  I did like the flat panel TV but agree with another reviewer who wishes the hotel would spring for HD Bed wasnt extremely comfortable but it wasnt too bad either  Bathroom was adequate although the toilet didnt flush properly and I wish there was more counter space Overall I am very satisfied with my stay at the Hyatt Regency and would do so again if I could get it for  or less  
P => Terrible This hotel has serious security problems  There are thieves brigands cutpurses roaming the entryway and the escalator leading up to the front desk even during the day  When my wifes wallet was stolen right in front of them the front desk people didnt much care  Security is definitely a concern here  The service is also subpar as our room service orders were consistently later than quoted or scheduled  The facilities are old and in need of reation  Overall for the price it is not a good deal  We have stayed at both Westins Michigan Ave  and River North and felt they were much much better  
P => Convenient but Busy Hotels location is quite convenient  Hotel or is modern although it was obvious the hotel is a bit older  ently maintained Room lighting could be better  Not a bad choice if booked at a discounted rate less than night  
P => We Loved It My husband suprised me with tickets to Wicked in Chicago as a Christmas gift and we stayed at the Hyatt Regency for the weekend  We flew in on Friday and out on Sunday  Check in was a breeze and the clerk took the time to explain the various views available and ended up placing us in a room that gave us a view of the river the lake and the city  The room was set up in a unique way with the bed in the center of the room with a deskworkarea behind the headboard and the large window behind that  It was a beautiful view both at night and during the day  The bathroom was clean and nice   not big but nice  The bathrobes were a nice touch The Theater was close enough to walk and the hotel concierge was very helpful to us providing area maps and recommendations  We ate at the restaurants within the hotel and although pricey they were GREAT We would definately return on a future trip  
P => Pros and cons My husband and I stayed here to just relax and get away  Our ior suite was very nice and clean  We had a great view of the river as well  The negatives were that the walls were very thin and we could hear a conversation some people were having in the next room so we just turned one of our two flat screen TVs up a little louder  Also room service was very expensive and the food wasnt even that great  Other than that good place to stay  
P => Great room great rate great service We stayed here     I booked them through Priceine at the fabulous rate of  night  We bid   on a  star hotel and amazingly it was accepted  Contrary to what other reviews said I found the customer service from ALL staff I encountered superior  Even staff that were not directly helping us were very friendly  As soon as we arrived which was only  in the morning we were helped by an extremely professional and friendly girl who found us a room even though it was many hours before check in  Someone made a comment on this site that they were treated poorly because they had booked thorugh Priceline  I felt like we were treated like wed paid full price  If any hotel treated us with less respect just because we got a great rate I also would be turned off by the hotel but this was definitely not the case for us  We also needed help from the concierge and he was great  I loved that we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for several hours the day we were leaving so we could walk around the city after check out  Our room was immaculate and large  And we only had a standard king room  Our bathroom was large  You could tell that the bathroom had been updated because the tub faucet and lever to turn it on were very outdated  I could have cared less but I know others who read this can be very particular and thought it would only be fair to point it out    The only thing quotwrongquot with the room was one of the closet doors was broken  It was off its hinges and basically leaning against the frame  Since we were only there for  days it didnt matter much to us  I just hoped we wouldnt be blamed for it Huge flat panel TV  Since we dont have one at home it was a treat  Large desk  Recliner and coffee table  We really didnt have much of a view except of the office building across the way but I didnt mind too much  For  I wasnt going to complain BUT from the way the East and West towers are situated I THINK if you check in at the East Tower you have a better chance of getting a view of the lake    We checked into the West Tower so I think thats why they put us in a room there    Oh yeah and the bed was SO comfortable Except for some late night partiers that woke us on Sunday morning about am in the hallway it was very quiet the rest of the time  In fact I found the room to be quieter than our room at home  And we dont live in a city I slept VERY well  
P => Great hotel Great hotel in a wonderful location  I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it  I couldnt recommend it highly enough  Evidently popular and busy the staff were still helpful The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean  Bathrooms were clean bright and spacious also Id definitely recommend this hotel too its close to the magnificant mile  
P => Very Nice Stay Ive stayed here at least four other times at this hotel but this stay was the best  I was wondering what type of room I would receive since I had booked this hotel through a discount hotel site for a FANTASTIC rate  Imagine my surprise when I got to my room and found gorgeous city views and very nice furnishings  The bathroom was nice and the linens were great  Yes   this is a HUGE  corporate hotel but if you get the right room it is very nice  The location is convenient to the MAG Mile and the loop  I was very happy with my room and my stay  
P => Good hotel excellent location The Hyatt Regency Park is an extremely corporate hotel   its massive so doesnt have much character  However the rooms were spacious and clean the facilities were good and the staff helpful I stayed there during a Christmas shopping trip to Chicago and its location couldnt have been better   its right at the top of the Magnificent Mile so is handy for when the shopping bags get a bit too heavyI would have preferred to stay at a more characterful hotel but the rate was so cheap I booked through expedia and there was nothing in our price range with any character  The hotel was perfectly adequate for what we wanted On booking I requested a room with a lake view and was given this for no extra charge which I thought for such a large hotel was good going  I would also request a room higher up the towers as the views are better I would recommend this to anyone who is travelling to Chicago but just be warned that the hotel doesnt have a personality of its own Luckily the city of Chicago makes up for this  
P => Kinda great    Ingore the naysayers I pricelined a couple of company rooms for  each    clearly the dead of winter is the off season so that  not work for you  But to be honest I was worried given some of the negative reviews on this board  I was surprised to find my room comfy reated and relatively perfect apparently the reation is done  The room service food had the whitefish was excellent the lobby grand  OK this isnt a four seasons so dont expect one but overall it was pretty damn nice and a hell of a bargain  
P => Nice Room I stayed here last ruary for a work related conference  The people at the front desk suggested we use the electronic check in kiosk but unfortunately it did not recognize the names of anyone in my company so we all ended up checking in at the desk anyway  The room was clean and I liked the modern or  Unfortunately the weather was terrible at the time sleetsnow so I couldnt take advantage of the nice location  I spent a lot of time watching TV in my hotel room so Im glad it was comfortable 
P => Great Place I stay here for work but its central for all tourist activities as well  Great place great location  
P => Great rate for a perfect location Excellent winter rate on the Hyatt website for a uary weekend in Chicago at  a night per room plus taxes   Travelzoo was showing other Chicago hotels running comparable rates in uary as well  I needed multiple rooms for a family trip  booked four rooms two with two double beds two kings via the Hyatt website  I had stayed in this hotel before for work the location is very central    on the river not far from Michigan AvenueArt Institute  We were visiting friends who live River North and friends in the South Loop so the Hyatt Regency was truly a central location  It was absolutely freezing the weekend we were in Chicago so walking to any sites was not happening    thankfully cabs were readily available at the hotel and rides were inexpensive  We also had rides from friends who live in Chicago and quickly realized that the driveway entrance to the hotel is a complete traffic jam  best to be picked up on the side streetThe rooms were clean comfortable beds spacious bathroom with ble floors  Suited our needs perfectly One note I had booked four rooms but at last mintue only needed three   Their cancellation policy is steadfast     hours notice required  I didnt have a problem with this since I knew about it in advance and seemed reasonable given how low the rate was   only reason I mention is to warn you that they really do have a cancellation policy 
P => Great Energy and Great Location made for a very nice stay  My best friend and I got a bargain on a package deal that included airfare and  nights at this hotel in mid uary of   I have seen a lot of negative reviews of this property recently and while some of them do have validity I feel most of them are overblown There were quite a few things I really liked about the property The hotel IS huge and while this  be a drawback for some I found it to give the property a great energy with people constantly around in the lobby and bar area  The location is excellent right by the Mag Mile  From our window on the rd floor we could see both the river and the Wrigley Building  There are several restaurants on the property and a Pedway you can use to link to several local businesses  The room was a tad small but immaculately clean  We had a big screen plasma TV as well  The wireless internet is very fast but a tad pricey  Beds were comfortable but nothing to go wild about There were also some things I didnt like of course  The front desk staff wasnt unfriendly but they were definitely all business  When I walked up to check in the first thing she said to me was quotLast namequot I found all the staff to be this way during the trip  All business no friendliness  Perhaps at a property this size it has to be that way but I still think a little quotWelcome to the Hyatt quot before quotLast Namequot would have been appropriate  The costs in the minibar while always expensive were outrageous here  A can of coke was over  Overall I enjoyed my time at the property and my weekend getaway to Chicago in general  My first time in the city I would be more than happy to stay at the Hyatt again  
P => Never again There are so many wonderful hotels in the Mag Mile area   from the Fairmont to even the riott So theres no reason to stay at the Hyatt unless you have to  My boyfriend and I were here for a conference and we found it lacking in many areas chief among which was the rude front desk people  The cleaning ladies and the repair staff which we had to contact to replace the lights in the bathroom were WONDERFUL The people working the front desk were incredibly rude especially when I called down to tell them about the lights in the bathroom  They made me feel like I was inconveniencing them  This is also the LOUDEST hotel Ive ever been in  We were on the th floor in the West tower and my guess is that these used to be suites that were turned into single rooms  The walls are so thin you can hear every conversation that goes on in the rooms beside you as well as in the hallway  You can also hear everything that happens in the bathrooms around you  It doesnt feel very private Honestly I think the hotel is just too big  The staff clearly cant handle the volume of people who come through here and it shows  All in all I wouldnt recommend this hotel  It is however clean and conveniently located  
P => Worst New Years Eve stay As a business person and frequent traveler I have to say that my stay for New Years Eve at the Chicago Hyatt was the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel   world wide From the over priced room  with a view  dirty windows looking at the river to the smoke smell to the messed up dinner reservations  the list goes on  We gladly paid the full  all access up graded room  cost trusting Hyatt for a great New Years and my wife and I were sadly disappointed to the point of checking out at am New Years Day to drive back home  
P => Consistantly acceptable I stay here whenever the hotel runs a special price  We are in Chicago often because our children attend college here  It seems like we are always in a different hotel with a couple places being our reliable fallbacks  This Hyatt falls in that category for us I wasnt in Chicago for the New Years celebration and glad this was not my motivation because the place was packed as was the entire city I checked in quickly being a gold member  Checked in again when the first room did not meet my standards  I think it was an afterthought on their part to see if I would complain  I did  I was moved swiftly into a better room but no view  This is a huge hotel but we get over it and enjoy the location being central to just about everything in downtown Chicago  Staffing and security was top priority it being New Years Eve and all  At AM there were several people continuing their party in the hall outside our room  But they were quickly dispersed and no additional problems  This said a lot to me given the security issues that MIGHT have been  At AM you could not tell there had been a massive party  All clean staff bright eyed and ready for a new day  Nicely done Hyatt especially with the security and getting us into a room with two doubles and a chair 
P => Best Thanksgiving Ever This hotel was great  We had access to all the major attractions  My dhters group were treated fairly good during the trip  The only problem was that some of the businesses were closed for the Thanksgivihg holiday  We made up with shopping on Black Friday down the Magnificent Mile  
P => Wonderful We booked through Travelocity for nt over  to   I was afraid wed get a less desirable room because of the cheap rate and was prepared for the worst  However we arrived in town about  am and were allowed to check in right away  I asked for a room with a view to see what would happen and we were given a room in the east tower on the rd floor facing the Hancock building  It was so nice The room was clean plenty of hot water very quiet  It is an excellent location  We walked everywhere State St shopping Mag  Mile Millenium Park etc    There were plenty of reasonable places to eat had one teenager with us  The Corner Bakery was the BEST for breakfast and so close  I really enjoyed Chicago and this hotel  
P => Good value at the Hyatt Regency We stayed at the Hyatt for a weekend away in early ember  The location is nice just one block from Michigan Ave  A  cab ride from Union Station  We found the check in easy and fast  Our room was ready before noon without any issues  The room itself was adequate with nice views of the river  Because this is a very large convention hotel do not expect some of the touches you find with the higher end properties in the city  Overall this is a good hotel for the money if you are planning to spend most of your time on Michigan Ave  
P => Best location in Chicago Loved the Hyatt  Check in was a  minute deal and we checked in early which was great Room was on the th floor which was great  Location is probably one of the best in Chicago free trolleys to Navy Pier Macys and other spots  Michigan Ave mag  Mile is  block away  Millenium Park also  block over  Great restaurants abound Catch  is FABULOUS also the CHOPHOUSE is also great  Also theres a free shuttle to an Indiana casino that leaves from the west tower every few hours  Also a great Italian bistro in the west tower that has great Italian food and sandwiches  Also had a party in the atrium with our group food was very good   Enjoyed our short stay and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
P => Ideal location to explore Chicago Stayed here for a long weekend in tember  The hotel is in an ideal location right in the middle of everything just a minute or two from the river  Hotel itself is standard Hyatt clean modern various bars etc  We booked a superior room which was on a high floor and looked directly over the Wrigley building   nice Bed was comfortable bathroom quite large and clean pretty much exactly what youd expect  I know some people have commented on the walls being thin and they  have a point but we certainly were not disturbed  For location and value it takes some beating  Id definitely stay here again  One thing to watch for   the cost of breakfast was extortionate  Go to a diner instead   there are plenty nearby  
P => Perfect Location I got a  rate at this hotel Thanksgiving week and loved the location  It is right at the beginning of the shops on Michigan Avenue and just two blocks from State Street Shopping  If you are in town to shop this is a great location  State Street looks much better now than what it was  The hotel is split between a quiet tower and one were all the meetings must be and the restaurants are at  It seems like two different hotels  
P => A very nice option I choosed the Hotel because the pictures in the homepage were very nice  In fact the hotel is conveniently located is big with a nice italian restaurant rooms are good sized and I feel satisfied with the choose but there are slightly better hotels if you want location Intercontinental Drake W or better ored on this area Sheraton I recomend you to go and drink to the bar of this hotel since the lobby and the bar are very nice and warm  
P => Very Good Choice Excellent location  We stayed for an extended girls shopping weekend  Price was adequate  night through the hotel reservation desk  We spent three nights at the hotel did extensive shopping took in two shows went to Greektown for dinner and never had to use the car or take a cab  The hotel is a very large complex but we found it easy to get around  We used the automated check in with the help of a desk clerk and had no problems with check in  We were done within minutes  We used the public underground parking facility where we unfortunately had to pay  per day for parking  Our room was nicely furnished  Appeared to have been updated within the past year or two  Very comfortable beds  Clean and neat  I would definitely consider staying here again when I next visit downtown Chicago  
P => TOP Notch The Hyatt Regency Chicago is AWESOME From the moment I arrived at the front door of this BEAUTIFUL property my EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED  From the polite professional Doormen who remembered my name on the way out    to the bubbly Front Desk clerk who asked if I was familiar to the city and then welcomed me to chicago and informed me of several of the key local attractions   to the happy HOUSEKEEPER who not only said hello in the hallway   but asked if everything in my room was to my satisfaction I dont know what the Hyatt is feeding these folks   but it seems to be a tall order of happiness  
P => No hot water We stayed at the Hyatt Regency   amd   The hotel was very busy with large numbers of people in and out of the lobby  There was always a cold draft from the constant opening of the doors  We had a room on the st floor facing the river  The view was better then the room  The floor lamp behind the chair had a one way low wattage light bulb  The internet connection for my lap top cost   per day  Friday morning the hot water quit just as my wife finished her shower  Saturday morning she showered first and when my turn came there wasnt any hot water at all  In fact no water came out of the hot water fawcet I finally got through to the front desk and the person offered a free breakfast to make up for no water  I asked why it just shut off and the person didnt have a clue  Since we already had breakfast plans and we were checking out we were offered   off of our bill which I agreed to  When I used the kiosk two hours later to check out there wasnt a credit  The managers representative took care of that  The Hyatt is an okay place if you like large crowds of people in the lobby  The location is good just off of Michigan Ave  Our room was in the East tower  This is the second time we have stayed there and probably will the last  There are too many very good hotels at the same price to select from  
P => High end but fustrating This is the second time we have stayed at the Hyatt for a conference and in both cases we have had mixed opinions on the the hotel  The good news on the hotel is that it has a large variety of well appointed rooms  Bad news is that you have no idea what room type you are going to get until you get there  This is fine if you get there early in the day and are flexible in the room type you can use however if you are particular this can drive you nuts  For us this was painful since we were there as a family and we really needed to have a room which we could have a roll away in  Last year everything went well and we actually got a king size bed wih a sleeper sofa the front desk didnt know that it was a sleeper sofa however what we found out from maid service is that most of the sofas are sleeper sofas even though the front desk doesnt know this  This year we arrived later and they offered us either a queen size bed or a king size bed without sleeper sofa  They suggested that we get the queen size bed since it would have more room for the roll away so we tried this  Unfortunately when we got up to the room we found a square table next to the bed which while nice if I was by myself completely blocked access for a roll away  After many conversations with the front desk and the assistant manager I was able to get this corrected and actually got a upgrade to a really nice room however it took forever and frankly I think we just got lucky  Others in our group didnt get this lucky  So     if room type matters definately get there early in the day or book at a different hotel which lets you select the room type Other big issue at this hotel is the elevators  Especially when the hotel is full getting a elevator is extremely painful Best advise is always give yourself  to  minutes to get a elevator press both the up and down arrows be willing to crush yourself into the elevator and if you are on a lower floor be ready to walk down the stairs Finally parking is expensive and hard to get garage has been full every time we are there so expect to park off site  Cheapest parking close by is at Millenium Park garage   just make sure to park at the farthest north point in the garage to minimze your walk  
P => Quite Disappointing I stayed at this hotel on  occasions last month   and had high expectations not only because of the excellent location of the hotel but also because I wrongly assumed that this would be a flagship Hyatt given that the Pritkzer family that owns the Hyatt chain is based in Chicago  Was I wrongLets start with the good Excellent locationvery nice views well appointed rooms nice large flat panel TV quick elevators its a big deal for a hotel with a LOT of floors Now the not so good The first thing that strikes you as you enter the hotel is the noise in the lobby   reminded me of a typical chain hotel in Times Square NYC  The next thing that hits you is the profile of the folks behind the check in counter   all of a particular racial profile etc  NO Im not being a racist   just find their hiring policies rather odd The first time i was there the check in was smooth  The nd time the woman checked me instopped short of handing me my keys and then asked me to wait a min and then disappeared for   mins  She returned to only say quotgive me another minquot and disappeared again  Finally I had to ask another woman from another counter to hand me my keys The rooms are ently appointed  The first time I was there I was expecting a typical small pokey Hyatt room   I was pleasantly surprised   nice King Sized bed rather spacious room for a Hyatt  The nd time I was expecting the same spacious room and was offered a Queen sized bed  Room turned out to be smaller than any other Hyatt room Ive stayed at     I guess since they gave me a room with an excellent view they  have felt justified in reducing the size of the room  Room service is frightfully expensive   again made me feel like I was back in NYC  And overall service in the hotel lacks graciousness   and quite impersonal  Overall a real disappointment Id only stay there if I cannot find alternate accommodations in Chicago  
P => A large convention hotel The Good first Conveniently located adjacent to Michigan Avenue shops and restaurants Millenium Park train stations and Wacker area business districts  Lots of available cabs My room was very nicely orated comfortable and spacious  Comfortable bed nice TV with lots of channels internet connection both wired and wireless for the usual fee The Not So Impressive quotImpersonalquot layout and service is an understatement  The place is huge  They even have quotself check in kiosksquot so if you dont want to speak to anyone at all throughout your stay it would actually be possible at this hotel  I did choose to check in with a human being  He couldnt have been less friendly and welcoming without being rude  A human check in kiosk I guess The property is laid out like an arena or convention hall  No charm and lots of ambient noise As another commented the walls in rooms are indeed quite thin There are so many choices in downtown Chicago that it is highly unlikely that Id choose to stay at this hotel again  
P => Nothing special  My family stayed two nights this summer  After waiting in the long unfriendly check in we got our room number  If you like walking and searching this is for you  Nothing impressive about room nice view of offices cubicles in building next door  Thank goodness for snack stand if you want a drink or apple  Expensive parking whoa  Good location but do some checking around  
P => Ill never stay at tthis hotel again  Stayed in the West Tower for a conference  The room was big the tub was dirty  Had to clean hair out of it to take a bath  No or very limited hot water and water pressure in the mornings  No free Internet access For over  bucks a night the least they could do is spring for for free Internet Even Super  does that  Hotel is big and noisy and extremely difficult to find your way around  Floors and levels have cryptic names like quotCrystal Ballroom purple level quot Where the heck it THAT I was constantly having to ask the staff where to go  I have a conference scheduled in il at this same Hotel and I will definitely stay somewhere elseLisa 
P => Large Impersonal Convention Hotel in Great Location I stayed here for  nights to attend a conference  I was given a room in the West Tower which has newer nicer rooms than those I have stayed in in the main building I liked my room enormously especially the great views of the Chicago River and Navy Pier and the clever office behind the bed set up  I had free Internet access However I disliked the rest of the hotel  Its huge and resulted in conference attendees running to cover the  minutes from one room to another  The restaurants are downket cheezy places  the best thing is the  hour deli below reception  The hotel is so huge it feels like they are feeding and tending to an army and I felt like I was being managed like in a Disney Park  My room was a refuge from this impersonal feel The dry cleaning service ruined a new cashmere sweater but they offered to pay for this  
P => Great Location  Not So Great Service I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference  The hotel is perfectly located only  blocks to Michigan Avenue where restaurants and shopping await  The hotel is huge   it has approximately  sleeping rooms and serveral restaurants and bars  While there I did eat at the restuarant on the main level of the hotel and found the service to be slow at best  Our waiter appeared overwhelmed and often forgot things that we requested of him  With a hotel is this size which often hosts conferences I expected the wait staff to be better prepared  The room was inviting and fairly clean  The bed was comfortable and the room offered a flat screen TV  I understand from colleagues that not every room was as nice  My only complaint was found in the bathroom  The tiles in the shower and the shower head appeared old and dirty and I also found a stain on one of the towels  The hotel offers wireless internet at day which is a bit pricey compared to other hotels  The hotel offers a great gym where there are approximately  tredmills that have invidivual TV screens several eliptical machines and free weights  Theres also a great runningwalking trail outside of the hotel that runs along Lake Michigan  I would consider returning to this hotel but would likely try another hotel on Michigan Avenue before staying here agin  
P => Luxury Hotel With No Charm I stayed at the HR  days from the th of ober for a conference for which the hotel is pretty optimal  For a private stay I would recommend to stay away from this hotel the lacks any form of charm The good   Good service  ent clean rooms  Good service  Good barThe bad   Too many people too much noise no charm  VERY noisy lobby area with some sort of jazz band playing music from a hidden spot   Boring rooms with low ceilings 
P => Disappointing Hyatt stay I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for  nights ober th   th   I was there for a conference that was being hosted by the Hyatt  The conference was held in the quotbasementquot of the hotel and the exhibitors were another escalator ride down to the quotsub basementquot  We were also served breakfast and lunch in the sub basement which was an unacceptable set up  But    back to the hotel   I think that the hotel has housekeeping issues  The entire hotel stinks of cigarette smoke and looks dated  The carpeting in my room had stains and the draperies looked like they hadnt been cleaned in a very long time  The room didnt convey a luxurious feeling at all and at  conference discount I would expect a lot more  The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful but I tried to spend as little time as possible in the room  The location was convenient however I would not recommend staying here again  
P => Hyatt I went there for the th of y the rates were amazing i got it for  dollars a nite for nights The hotel is nice the rooms are cool food is good and staff can be better but overall good location and nice place to stay in chicago but not as nice as the W lakeshore  
P => Great Location I booked this room using Hyatt Passport reward points so to be perfectly honest I expected a standard room  I was pleased to be given a deluxe King on the th floor of the West Tower with an absolutely stunning view of the river and the lake  The room size is what one would expect for an urban hotel but I must admit the designers were quite clever in making this room quotworkablequot  The headboard served as a low room divider with a nice desk area behind it near the window  I very much enjoyed sitting at this desk and watching the traffic along the river  There is a small table on coasters that slides beneath the desk allowing for additional work space  I also wheeled this table around and near the bed to hold room service while watching television There is a nice comfortable easy chair with ottoman an additional table and two very small extensions of the headboard that serve as bedside quottablesquot  The small round table by the easy chair held a living bamboo plant  The in room safe had problems and I complained to the front desk who connected me to security  A young man came up immediately and worked for a long time to fix the problem without success  He told me that someone would be up the next day and asked me for a convenient time  When no one had arrived a half hour after the desginated time I called again and someone immediately responded who worked a long while before calling for his supervisor  It was determinied that a new faceplate was needed  The repair was made and both gentlemen were extremely apologetic  I was able to store items in the safe  It is a bit small for storing an average size laptop however I had two breakfast meals and one late night dinner via room service  Each time the meals were delivered within the time promised  minutes  minutes and  minutes were times given but two meals arrived in  minutes and one   The meals were all very good  I also used the express take out coffee and pastry place and found the food fresh and convenient there As another author has mentioned there are a lot of choices for food near the hotel  In room dining is always expensive with the added fees that come with it but there are times when the convenience is worth the cost  The in room coffee maker would have allowed me to avoid the cost of the large pot of coffee I ordered with breakfast had I chosen to do that but I agree with the others who complained about the mini bar  I appreciated the fact that the front desk notified me that the mini bar was weight sensitive  Knowing that I did not even open the door  Normally I really enjoy having the bar and often do purchase items  Having had a weight sensitive fridge charge me for items I did not use which resulted in my having to argue with the front desk at another property  I avoided the bar  I think Hyatt would be better served replacing the mini bars than dealing with the ill will of so many  There are likely others like me who would welcome the bar and use it if they were not concerned about touching something and causing unwanted charges to be added to their bill And speaking of charges    I was charged a fee of  plus for receiving a fax at the hotel  It was listed as quotBusiness Servicesquot  i was told it was there upon check in and that I should go four flights down to pick it up  Before I got around to doing that it was slipped under my door so I dont know if the charge was for delivery or for receiving the fax but I did not attempt to argue over it upon check out  I have stayed at other urban hotels where I have not been charged for receiving faxes or packages and where free internet has been available  At the Hyatt one can purchase a Business Plan but the plan packages Internet service and a continental breakfast and newspaper as part of the plan  I did not purchase the plan but the newspaper arrived daily anyway and as far as I can tell I was not charged for it  I wish they would remove the breakfast from this plan  Actually what i wish is that they would provide free wi fi  I find myself frequenting coffee shops and other places that do provide this service and avoiding those who do not  It is increasingly difficult to find free internet connectivity at large hotels and is becoming much more easy to find it at budget properties  I woud rather buy my morning newspaper as I do at budget hotels and have free wi fi  Perhaps we can all collectively say this loudly and eventually be heard I was at the hotel for four nights and there were at least two different large convention groups at the hotel during my stay  The hotel is large but that fact did not interfere with my having a very pleasant stay at the hotel  The fact that this hotel is a convention destination really did not impact me at all The employees were all friendly and I found the location to be excellent  I have traveled to Chicago many times in the past both for work and pleasure  I often stay at the riott on Michigan and it has long been my favorite property in Chicago  This visit to the Hyatt is making me re think that though  The view from my room was just so wonderful  the Navy Pier lights and fireworks at night  the river and lake blues and greens of the day  that view really made this room stand out There was a robe in the room typical Hyatt amenities  Portico soaps etc I guess my only complaints would be the lack of drawer space and plumbing noise  There were a lot of hangers in the closet and there was a shallow and a deep drawer in the closet as well as the one by the bed  but I could have used another drawer  I was traveling lightly but I still would have liked one more drawer  Also the toilet flushed nosily and whenever the person in the room above flushed the toilet or used the shower the noise could he heard in my room  I heard noise in the hallway several times If you can get a reservation at the North Pond a restaurant located in Lincoln Park I highly recommend that while you are in Chicago  Lots of wonderful places to eat but North Pond is among the best  
P => Very enjoyable I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency and enjoyed myself very much  Check in was very simple and the room was well appointed with nice amenities like an iPod ready alarm clock and extra large shower  The bed was very comfy and the numerous throw pillows were a nice touch  Downsides the bathroom was a little dark and I didnt see anything to vent out the steam while showering so the place was really steamy when I stepped out  Also I was a little annoyed at their Draconian refrigerator policy not only can you not store anything of yours in there  fee if you do but you cant even move items around that the hotel put in the fridge  apparently the thing is weight sensitive so any change will automatically go on your bill  
P => Fine for Business This hotel is priily for business travelers and large groups  On the day I checked out the agent told me they had  convetion travelers checking out  The place is pretty standard Hyatt    The rooms and amenities are nice  Theres an Ipod player by the bed  The best thing about this hotel is the nice coffee amp breakfast pastry bar in the lower lobby  Its great when youre on the go  
P => Great location We stayed for  night t     We arrived at am and were able to check in which was nice because we wanted to drop our stuff and head for Michigan Ave  Beautiful room on the th floor with view of the Illinois Center and a sliver of Lake Michigan  Very nicely orated with white comforters a body pillow other throw pillows  Large flat screen t v  internet access large desk reclining chair  The bathroom had nice toiletries and a massaging shower head  Extra towels and pillows iron amp board in the closet  There was also a coffee maker that we didnt use  This is a very large hotel with  floors in the east tower we were in  Didnt go in the west tower  Very nice lobby area with restaurants and a gift shop  We didnt eat here though  Excellent location for sightseeing as the architecture river tours leave from just below the hotel  Fannie Mae candy on the corner of Michigan amp Wacker  Corner Bakery on the next corner  McDonalds behind the Wrigley buiding Billy Goat tavern below the Wrigley Building plenty of Starbucks around and a Walgreens nearby  Easy walk to Millennium Park and all the shops of Michigan Ave  Also walkable to Navy Pier although make sure you have your walking shoes on and if youre lucky youll get to ride one of their free trolleys  
P => 
P => This hotel was what Id expect from a Hyatt  in EASTERN EUROPE I didnt book this hotel a family member did as a bunch of us flew in for a wedding  If I had to spend more than  hours there I would have left for somewhere else  This hotel which I actually saw on some websites had  stars was a dump  It was more like staying in a college dorm than a hotel  The room smelled  The carpet was gross and old  There was no real closet  The worst part was they didnt have a fitted bedsheet for the mattress  they put a top sheet on for the bottom sheet which of course slid off anytime you moved  The room was just disgusting When we checked in Friday night about  we were hungry but the resaurant was closed except for the bar  We did eat at the restaurant for breakfast and it was actually good great pancakes  the only good part of the whole hotel The hotel is only close to the convention center  EVERYTHING else is a cab ride  They have a one way shuttle downtown but only leaves every hour  When I inquired about it the concierge didnt know the times it left and didnt tell me that I could make a reservation for it fortunately my family member found out and reserved us seats or that would have been another cab fare Overall for this same money Ive stayed in riott Courtyards and Hampton Inns x as nice  This place was just horrible  
P => I got stuck in a small corner room Just not a great location for Chicago  I moved hotels after two nights to a riott that was very central off of Michigan Ave for the same price  The room I got stuck in was pathetic for a Grand Hyatt Hotel  
P => Excellent convention hotel As many before me have mentioned this is a great hotel for the convention center   you dont even have to go outside  If the reason for your trip is a convention then I think its the best possible choice  I attended a conference in Chicago and stayed at this hotel as well as the Hyatt Regency on Wacker the Hyatt Regency Chicago  I think of the two the McCormick Place Hyatt is more modern and has probably been more recently updated  The room was very clean the room design was more current and the bathroom fixtures were newer  On the other hand I think the service at this hotel was perhaps not as serene as at the Hyatt on Wacker   I had longer waits to speak with the conciergefront desk at the McCormick Place Hyatt and I got some quotI dont knowsquot from the front desk in response to questions they should have been able to accommodate  One example was when we inquired regarding the Metra which is the closest public transportation option to our hotel   they didnt have any schedules on hand and could not tell us anything about using it  Another example   I left an item in my room when I checked out and one of my colleagues who was still in the room brought it down to be mailed to me and filled out a FedEx slip with my name and address  Due to a lack of communication between the front desk and the packing departments however calls to the front desk about my item the next day got a response that they didnt know anything about it  After calling back again and speaking to shipping where it turns out my item would have languished until I managed to get connected to someone who knew something about it they finally took my credit card information and sent my item which I have since received  I am inclined to attribute some of this confusion to the fact that many people were checking out the day I did and I had confidence that this issue would eventually be resolved satisfactorily but I think the front desk could strive to emulate the focus on service that the Hyatt on Wacker demonstrated to me during my stay there That said for attending a conference in Chicago I wouldnt stay anywhere else  
P => Great views great staff I showed up kind of tired at the desk last Friday night and the woman who checked me in somehow intuited that I needed a break  She was a lifesaver    gave me a gorgeous room  which was a corner suite with breathtaking views on three sides  I spent the first night just glued to the windows enjoying room service with a friend in an equally gorgeous room and and watched the world go by  I called the desk to thank the womderful agent who gave me this blissful room but she was gone by the time I did it    and now I forget her name  I fell badly about that  She was a fantastic employee Hyatt  People like this keep me coming back to your properties The hotel is like McCormick Place    big busy and self contained  I cant say enough about my room which was truly so lovely that I hated to leave it  I never even went into Chicago The hotel restaurant was okay    my meal was fair enough although perhaps not quite as good as it could have been  The waiter messed up the order for example noticed that he had brought the wrong things and then walked away without correcting it  That was odd  But this is to quibble when I could go back to the beautiful room and watch the fireworks over the Navy Pier  And the meeting rooms were good the food at the meetings very high quality and it was comfortable in every way  
P => Mediocre   not worth the price The good Housekeeping was superb  The clothes I accidently left on the bed were folded and placed on the desk  The hotel connects to the convention center  If youre attending a conference its nice to get to the conference in under  minutes  The lobby is pretty modernnice and full of extensive groups of comfortable couches  perfect for doing work or meeting with others  The bad the walls are SUPER THIN  my neighbors am shower sounded as if it were from my room  You can hear everything from the hallway  from people closing doors to full conversations  Good thing Im a sound sleeper The cable wasnt working for half of my trip likely due to rain satellite TV I assume  The fitness center which isnt as extensive as Hyatt boasts was completely packed each morning between  am  I couldnt get on any of the bikes elipticals or treadmills  Finally the rooms were just okay  Nothing spectacular great views from the top floors facing north  The ugly NOTHING IS INCLUDED and the ammenities are massively expensive  Internet which has cut out on me x since starting this review is  dollars per day if you want high speed cable internet it will cost you  dollars per day  Drinks at the bar were   dollars for well drinks watersoda is   tax and use of a computer or printer at the business center is about  dollars  Because nothing is around the hotel and the surroundings are a bit sketchy youre really stuck on paying for highly overpriced room service or ordering delivery  When you factor in a high price per night you can easily expect to pay  dollars per night to stay here  In all I would recommend this hotel for those who dont care about price and want to stay literally in the convention center  Keep in mind that a taxi here from downtown is   dollars each way and there is also METRA service and tons of bus service to the convention center  So if you dont mind   min travel time staying at a nicer and cheaper hotel downtown  be your best bet for the money  Hope this helps 
P => the hotel itself looks great but location and shuttle are horrible the hotel and room are clean and new and moden  no question about that  BUT its so faryou end up paying all the money you save on taxis buses and trains anyway the free shuttle they provide only drops you off in  locations  you have to find your own way back  and they dont start running until am who starts their day at am i ended up paying for taxi rides to downtown and back which ended up being about  per trip each way 
P => Good location for Bear game Good location to Bear game shed aquarium museum  No inout parking sucks  Overpriced for the room quality  
P => Nice hotel a little pricey but it is Chicago  Stayed here for  nights in ober  for a convention taking place at the McCormick place convention center connected to this hotel  Ill tell you its very convienent to be at this hotel for conventions but Im not sure why youd want to stay here for any other reason The hotel itself is nice clean and spacious  The lobby is beautiful  The rooms are well appointed with flat screens and good views if you get a room over the th floor or so  The bed was comfortable tons of soft pillows and there was the option to buy bottled water in the room for bottle oz  The same bottles were being sold down in the gift shop for  ea  One other thing I really liked was that the elevators were quick and efficient  What I didnt like was breakfast buffet at Shor with nothing special in it eggs bacon pankcakes sausage fruit etcday to park  w in and outI wish the room was a little more soundproof   could hear TV in the next room over and talking in the hallway Very expensive room rate when there are tons of deals close by on S  Michigan Ave Its also a little away from the action in Chicago with almost all bars restaurants etc being at least a  cab ride away each way Economy internet was day with a faster option available for slightly more These are the prices you can expect at all the major players in Chicago so I wont take off too many points for their prices  
P => Great benefits and View From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty It was easy to access the hotel from the highway and the parking garage was easily accessed for self parking  Check in went smoothly we had reserved as part of a Summer Package and received a room w a citylake view on the top floor Also as part of the package was free self park and free wireless internet  The concierge was very helpful and recommended a place for dinner  We did see a show quotThe Color Purplequot at the Arie Crown Center in McCormick Place and getting to and from the show was extremely easy and completely indoors  The hotel does offer a free shuttle to the Mag  Mile but it only leaves on the hour and only has  seats so it was booked for any time that we wanted to go  Taxi to the Mile depending on where you are going is   each way  The room was a fair size and clean  The or was slightly older but in good shape  Our view from  was AMAZING We could see Navy Pier the ina and several of downtowns buildings  The beds at the Hyatt hotels are wonderful and we never have a hard time sleeping I did use the Fitness Center and it was very nice and accessible  hours  The only downside of this hotel for me is that it is a little out of the way for what I am usually doing in Chicago  I would definetely stay here again though 
P => Clean and comfortable at a great price This is a great hotel and they frequently have great price discounts available through Priceline  The staff is very courteous and they go out of their way to help you enjoy your stay  The hotel is very clean from the lobbycheck in to the rooms  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were quite large for a standard hotel room  There were also great amenities like Aquafresh toothpaste and great shampooconditioner  I would have to say that this hotel is a bit out of the way  Its close to the convention center which is near Soldier Field  Its about a  cab ride into the city and believe me that cab ride is worth it for the deal you get here  The hotel also has an hourly shuttle to take you into the city  I would suggest to the hotel that this become a half hour shuttle as it can fill up quickly and also its easier to plan your day if you can leave on a more flexible schedule Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting Chicago  
P => Wonderful Anniversary Weekend At Hyatt Mccormack Place Chicago My wife and I recently celebrated our th wedding anniversary and what better a city to do that in than Chicago  We booked using Priceline and got a favourable rate  I contacted the hotel to advise them that this was a special occasion for us and inquired if an upgrade would be possible On check in we were greeted by quotHappy Anniversary   we have upgraded you to a suite quot Music to our ears  And what a suite   it had about  sq  ft  about the size of a small condo  The view of Chicagos shoreline was amazing  The staff   each and every one went out of their way to be helpful We used valet parking which was a bit steep at   per day but the valet service was both prompt and curteous  One last thing about the hotel   their bar on the main level was warm and welcoming for a nightcap Several days we did not use the car at all  No problem the   bus stops right in front of the hotel and runs right up Michigan Ave  to most key tourist attractions  During the week service is very frequent   less so on weekends  You can get a travel pass for unlimited Chicago Transit Authority travel for use on both busses and subway  Using the subway   red line involves a non user friendly walk tofrom the subway station  The   bus is a much better bet Two suggestions for visitors who  not have visited this wonderful city in a long time     Tave the Architectural River Cruise  great    Have dinner at Old Town Brasserie   the food service and piano player were all great  Super wine list as well Hope you enjoy as much as we did  
P => Hyatt Name WITHOUT Hyatt  Star Quality I stayed at this hotel for the Rock N Roll Chicago Half athon and although it was a somewhat nice enough hotel its definitely NOT hyatt  Star Quality  This hotel deserves a Star at best   is pushing it  There was sitting water in our bathtub the room was warm upon check in the pillows on the bed were stained and the reations mentioned on their site werent apparent the wall paper in our bath room was peeling off the wall  The bathrooms are EXTREMELY small  We requested another room and were told there were none available and after calling several times and going back to the front desk another room was provided for us which makes me feel like we were lied to because just mins before that there was quotnothing availablequot  I wouldnt suggest this hotel to anyone  Also it is far from all of the quotMichigan Avequot attractions youll need a cab or bus to get ANYWHERE except the convention center which is attached to the hotel  Its an optimal hotel for business travel but i wouldnt chose to stay here again otherwise  If youre a hyatt fan id opt for Hyatt Regency Chicago 
P => Checking in and parking are ridiculous but rooms are nice and comfortable We stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago with our three kids  We tried to secure our rooms an hour before check in   at most hotels you can check in secure your rooms but then simply wait until official check in to get your keys while the rooms are being prepared  At this hotel this is impossible  During a very busy day they made everyone wait around in the lobby until pm  It was packed with people  Why not just check everyone in and then have them wait to get the key only Then those who got there early have a better chance of getting the room type requested As it was for us we had kids with us and waiting in a packed space is trouble so we left to go to the aquarium  By the time we came back we were on ARATE FLOORS  We were told the next day they would automatically move us to new connected rooms  Nope  We had to come up and request it again making us wait to find new rooms and then wait for our luggage  On top of that people should know that parking is extremely high and if you want to use a car at all that you are forced to use valet for in and out privileges for  a day or your parking is  each and every time you leave  Thankfully the front desk people are kind its not their fault the check in system and parking is stupid but it was a hassle Contrary to a lot of reviews the hotels location isnt terrible at all depending on why you are there  If you want nightlife and downtown this is possible if you drive or take the bus but if you are there for museums like we were its good  Its within walking distance of The Field Museum Soldier Field Shedds Aquarium Adler Planetarium and th Street Beach next to public transportation the   bus pulls up right in front of the hotel and has many places to eat nearby within walking distance or a short drive  Chinatown is a few blocks down Cermak Street  Checking out didnt work via television so again we had to wait in line to check out  Also although they have three kiosks available for checking in and out none of them were ever working  Also no free internet  No wi fi at all  Only a for pay ethernet cable was available  The rooms are clean the beds are comfortable and our view was beautiful  The hotel is perpendicular to the lake so if you are on any of three sides of the hotel you get an awesome city AND lake view  I just wish it wasnt so much of a hassle to do simple things  
P => Perfect for the business traveler As I read the previous reviews I was a little concerned  I was going to be spending a week in this hotel for a conference  I was actually considering a different hotel  I contacted their customer service rep by e mail and outlined my concerns  I needed a reliable internet connection  I needed a no smoking room on a no smoking floor asthma I needed a refrigerator in the room medicine I needed enough space in the room or at the bell stand for a scooter  I was assured by an e mail response the next day that none of the above was a problem  I arrived early and was checked in immediately  The room was clean spacious and exactly what I needed  Some might quibble that it was not up to date but just give me a great bed a desk with a task chair a chair or couch for comfortable reading and be clean  A big plus was the state  of the art gym with plenty of treadmills and bicycles  and towelsThe housekeeping staff was generous with towels and de caf coffee for the in room machine  The place was packed with my compatriots and really it is perfect if you are going to be at the Convention Center just an elevator ride and an enclosed walkway away The service was consistent  The staff really got that those people were anxious to get to their meetings but also needed breakfast  The wait staff was friendly the food in the hotel restaurant was fresh and fast  The coffee came in a press and the tea was a premium brand with a pot So here we are the last night  Dropped stuff off at the package room  The person manning the room was efficient and keen on detail And yes the public bus for   picks up right in front of the hotel for a trip to the museum or downtown  If you are an experienced business traveller I pretty sure that you will be content with this choice as my friend who checked out this morning said this is a hotel that really gets what we need And yes a clean fast internet connection as I send this recommendation  
P => Great Hotel What can I say it is a Hyatt  We were on the th floor  on th of y and could see about  to  different fireworks shows put on by the smaller communities of Chicago  I liked that the hotel was away from the crowds  It costed about  to get to the Navy Pier by taxi  They also offer a shuttle service on the hour  You have to sign up for it ahead of time  It gets full quick so as soon as you check in you  want to get your name on the sheet  The room was beautiful and the bathroom was huge  I am very happy with my stay here  
P => Great Bargain I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for  night in e on a Saturday when I went to watch the USvHonduras World Cup Qualifier  PRICE plus tax on Priceline com was well worth it  there was three of us staying at the hotel so it helped even more ROOMRoom was crisp and clean  Neatly cut blue and white linens on the bed large flat screen TV  Pseudo bathroom where the sink was out side of the bathroom itself sort of like a large water closet where the toilet and shower was behind the door  Room wasnt huge but it came with a double bed  We didnt stay in the room very long just a place to clean up store our stuff and sleep for a couple of hours before an early morning flight LOCATIONAbout a  minute walk from soldier field couldnt ask for a better location to support events at the stadium  Easy access to downtown Chi Town AMENITIESDidnt see much in the way of newspapers or extras  We didnt eat at the hotel so I cant comment much on that  The one problem I had was I couldnt connect to the high speed internet or it wasnt available  SERVICEStaff was pleasant and efficient  Checked in and out with ease  Overall from my limited stay I would recommend this hotel  It definitely felt like a business hotel as it was attached to a convention center but for one night from Priceline its top notch in my book  
P => Thanks for making our first Chicago trip a good one  We got a great deal through Priceline on this hotel  We were a bit concerned at first because of the location on the quotSouth sidequot  Those fears are unwarranted as you probably wont be walking anywhere from this hotel  The location is a bit distant from downtown causing you to rely on public transportation a lot  However the hotel offers a free shuttle that takes you downtown  You are on your own getting back but just grab the   bus and it drops you off right in front of the hotel  The shuttle driver was awesome She even took us to the closest blue line station to get to the airport after we checked out so we wouldnt have to pay for a taxi or fool with dragging our luggage on a bus   I hope I dont get her in trouble for that as thats not one of the shuttle stops  But there were only a couple people on the shuttle and it was on the way to downtown   Thats indicative of the overall service we received while at the Hyatt  Thank you Hyatt The hotel has all the amenities you would need  room service onsite restaraunts pool fitness center concierge etc  Very nice or comfortable and clean My only complaint is the location but if you plan accordingly its not a big deal  It was our first trip to Chicago so we werent there to sit in a hotel  We got up and got going and didnt come back until the evening  We made sure to grab dinner before returning to the hotel as there isnt much nearby but we also ordered in from downtown restaraunts Giordanos and a chinese place and had it delivered with no problem  Hotel food is a bit expensive but what hotel isnt Theres a McDonalds within walking distance down a few blocks and theres even one in the McCormick Place convention center if you need a meal in a pinch We even got adventurous and walked back to the hotel one afternoonevening from the Grant ParkMuseum Campus area  It was only a couple miles but stopping to grab dinner on the way and admiring the scenery made it enjoyable  We myself wife and  boys  amp  safe the whole way to the hotel we took Michigan Ave to Ceremak  
P => When In Chicago Stay at the Hyatt at McCormick Place I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place and was very impressed  The suite was beautiful the views we outstanding  We were able to view a fireworks display at the Navy pier form our room on Saturday night   I wondered if Liz the Guest Experience Manager ordered that display for our party  Service was excellent the suite was excellent and very roomy  The view of downtown Chicago and the lake were awesome  The staff was great and helped us out by providing extra trash cans in the room  We had a get together at my suite after the graduation  people and tons of food fit easily  The staff helped us transport the supplies and food in and out of the hotel It was an excellent location as I was attending an event at UoC  Access to downtown was very easy  I would very much like to stay here again  As a matter of fact it was very hard to leave the room to head back home  LCD tv great walk in closet nice living room area and very highly recommendedI want to thank Liz and the staff for making my stay a memorable and enjoyable stay  
P => Wonderful hotel Had fabulous time We stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place and loved it Service was excellent rooms very nice the pool was warm and wonderful  Great finess center Very convenient to soldier field Would definitely stay here again  Highly recommended 
P => they care Lets just say the front desk cares what you think about the place  So   upper management is doing its job They take care of you when they mess up Part of me wishes that they didnt mess up The hotel plays the part however it is  ft from the main lobby of the convention center  Beats the hell out of waiting for a shuttle other stuff walls are waaaay too thin business center is clean but a rip off 
P => Almost Clean but great location If the first room I checked into was clean I would have been happier  the location couldnt be better for access to McCormick Place The business center was useful but I preferred the Kinkos in McCormick Place  I didnt take advantage of the Restaurants in the hotel  much prefer to check out some new places in Chicago Parking seemed a bit expensive and honestly why cant the staff read If the sign says entrance and exit to the parking structure    why would they block it off and allow people to almost get into accidents The room is modern but they should join the ranks of hotels providing free internet  
P => Clean but DEFINITELY not to Hyatt standards I attended the NRA trade show last weekend and stayed at this Hyatt for two nights  First let me say that the public areas were very nice  The employees we came into contact with were FANTASTIC especially at the front desk housekeeping and gift shopconvenience store  Definitely a typical Hyatt experience   UNTIL you walk into the room  OMG  If you blindfolded me took me into the room took the blindfold off and asked me what hotel chains room I was standing in I would have to say Holiday Inn  This is not to say that the Holiday Inn is in any way a terrible chain   but Hyatt standards are most definitely not met in these rooms  For the over  per night charged it doesnt even come close to being acceptable  The closet is even covered by a CURTAIN  There is no safe in the room for a business hotel no magnification mirror small annoyance the towels were so thin and dare I even mention the toilet paper Im sure some prisons use softer toilet paper  Forget the coffee too   ugh the room had the single serve piece of plastic k coffee maker that drips out one cup of horrible coffee at a time in about  minutes  Most of the hotels at this price range also offer WIRELESS internet access some without cost but I was tethered to the desk and had to pay an additional  for  hours of internet access or take my laptop over to the convention center where it is FREE  If you HAVE to stay here it is convenient to the convention center and the rooms are kept very clean by a wonderful housekeeping staff  Perhaps it is because I am used to our Florida Hyatts that are impeccable and luxurious that I am aghast at this particular location  I saw many hotels in the downtown area that would put this hotel to shame   and it would cost the same to take a cab out to the convention as it did to take a cab out of the convention area to downtown where there is absolutely nothing to do after the convention closes each day  If you have to pay more to stay downtown it would be well worth it   IMHO  Frankly this should not be called a Hyatt   nice standard hotel but not Hyatt  
P => Great Convention Hotel Stayed here for  nights during a tradeshow in ch  Booked a standard king room and was upgraded to a Corner Suite I am a Diamond member with Hyatt Check in was fast and efficient  The staff was friendly and very professional  For those attending a trade show at McCormick Place you cannot beat the convenience of a  minute walk from your hotel room to the exhibition area The rooms are very clean and up to date as far as modern furnishings go  LCD tv nice furniture orations  The bed is very soft and comfortable   perfect for resting after standing all day during a trade show  The bathroom is somewhat small but great nonetheless  Noise was not an issue although you could hear the occasional sound of doors closing in the hallway The hotel is located right next to McCormick Place which is situated south of the Chicago downtown area  If youre visiting as a tourist and have no business at McCormick I recommend staying elsewhere  Otherwise you will be spending money on taxi fare or spending   minutes walking to the downtownMagnificent Mile area I tried the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs and it had a wide selection of good food with great service  The barlounge was ok but service was poor most likely due to the large crowd of tradeshow visitors I would stay here again only if I had to visit McCormick Place  
P => Worth staying at if you have business at McCormick Place Just returned having attended a conference at McCormick Place  The hotel itself is clean and  star quality  There is a skywalk on the nd floor that leads right into McCormick Place so it made going back and forth very convenient  As other readers have pointed out as long as you have business at McCormick Place it is the place to stay at for sure  The only challenge is the hotel is not near anything else I did discover a McDonalds about a   min walk  I did make the use of the hotel shuttle into town but it only runs up to  pm   it dropped me off downtown and I managed to take the bus back the   bus by the way  Overall I had a very pleasant experience  
P => A good solid hotel if youre at McCormick Place The hotel is perfectly located for events at McCormick place  The rooms are clean and presentable if not a little stodgy in their or  The staff were perfectly helpful without being overbearing  The restaurant downstairs was good and the snack shop well stocked  No complaints there  The internet cable in the room is exceptionally short bring a spare if you can  Business center is good staff are again helpful  However it is a real trek to get downtown for any entertainment or food  If youre at the McCormick and need to get some work done its perfect  
P => Little details make all the annoying difference Id like to thank previous reviewers for all of their tips  I brought with me plenty of snacks and more importantly a  foot long ethernet cord  This has really helped me I was assigned to a beautiful suite they must have been out of standard rooms  An amazing view of downtown Chicago and the water  Wow  And more room than the lower floor of my house That being said I cant believe such a fabulous room is red by so many little annoyances  For one thing not only is there no wireless but the ethernet cable is short and located on the desk so if you want to work on your laptop from the bed bring a long ethernet cable of your own  Second there are no easily accessible power outlets next to the bed I generally like to plug in my iPhone and use it as a backup alarm in case the hotel one doesnt work Third the walls really are paper thin and Im pretty noise tolerant in generalFinally the sheets on the bed are weird   the bottom sheet is thin so thin you can see through to the mattress and doesnt tuck under the head of the bed and the sheets around the comforter dont seal  So while Im not one of those people who runs around with a UV light even I question whether this feels quotcleanquot On the bright side they did supply a tube of toothpaste in the room which is really nice  I like hotels that supply toothpaste and mouthwash this one didnt supply the mouthwash since bringing those  ounce bottles everywhere doesnt always work out for me And as I said the view at least from this room was unbelieveable  Too bad I was there for a conference and couldnt enjoy it for very long  
P => Not bad if youre exhibiting or attending a convention at McCormick The rooms are pretty solid and definitely for business travelers  If you are attending or exhibiting there the convenience is unbeaten  They just added a mini fridge which is good for those who like to stock their rooms during these trips  Do stock plenty of water since the air quality will dry you up like a prune during sleep  Unfortunately they have not upgraded their TVs yet and have a terrible channel selection  The sauna pool and gym is not bad at all for a business hotel  The concierge is pretty solid when they are around  They also have auto check in and check out but there is no flexibility with changing your room using the machine  The store at the hotel is a complete rip off  Unlike many other midwest hotel stores the k up is incredible   especially the booze and refreshments  The in hotel bar provides the best value for the food there  There are many TVs at the bar just in case you are a sports fan  About the convention center the food is slim pickins so be warned  For a normal lunch you will spend close to   They have a cafeteria with hot food which is the most expensive and a Connies and McDonalds on the lower level  Truthfully the McDonalds is the only food establishment there that is not a complete rip off  Tip   the taxi line is much shorter at the hotel entrance as opposed to the convention center entrance  
P => Good stay for McCormick Travelers We stayed here for a audition that my dhter had at the McCormick Place perfect for us for the night the rooms were nice and clean our veiw was not that great room  overlooking the water  The smoke stacks that came from just below our room took away from anything that would have been nice to see Food was good beds comfrontable and the overall stay was very nice  
P => Great Hotel but Overpriced  We stayed here over New Years  to visit with some family  The hotel itself was very nice excellent gym and pool very nice rooms overall with plenty of space to work  The staff at the restaurant downstairs and the doormen were very friendly and helpful and got to know us after a day or two  The internet was   day and you had to get on through an ethernet cable which was really frustrating since there were two of us who needed to work from the room  Theres really nothing nearby we walked  blocks to a McDonalds and thats the only thing at all close aside from the convention center which was pretty deserted while we were there over New Years eve day  If youre going to a conference at the McCormick Place this is probably a great place to stay though as its right by the convention center  Its really overpriced which again goes with the conference thing  Overall not a bad experience but for price and location reasons its clearly a hotel geared toward people attending conferences  
P => Great fo Convention Center Stayed at the hotel for the CFA Exam which was prored in McCormick Place on     I booked a quotwinter getawayquot package for  for a standard room that included free parking  When I told them I was sitting for an exam they automatically upgraded me to a large studio suite on the nd floor with views of the loop and the lake  I know the area this is not an area where most will want to roam around late at night so I didnt go outside much  But for the use of the convention center it was everything I could have hoped for  Great experience 
P => Be careful with your personal belongings they will steal it Make sure you never leave a cellphone visible in your room especially a blackberry as it will be stolen  Even a measly   bill lying around as it will be taken and the staff will explain to you that there is nothing that they can do about it as their professional lock down system shows that it is only you that had access to your room  It was a horrible experience when you know the housekeeping staff is keeping tabs on you  No consolation as you were looked at in the face that you were the liar in the situation  Staying at the Hyatt does not mean that you are staying at a  star hotel  The only convenience it has is the convention next door  
P => Nice Room Bad Service I guess I shouldnt complain much being that I paid night through priceline for the room at this hotel attached to the Chicago convention center and the room was clean and comfortable  Unfortunately service means a lot to me and the people I spoke to at this hotel just didnt seem to understand that they are in the business of hospitality  be it was because it was a slow weekend for them and they werent really on their A game but still the rudeness apathy and attitudes I received from the stuff was unneccessary  I wont stay there again if it can be avoided  
P => A mediocre convention hotel This is a pricey hotel in a dicey neighborhood with nothing nearby but the convention center and a cash only McDonalds  If it had a ent restaurant and a cafe that stayed opened later than  p m  then it might squeak by  But the cafe is very limited the restaurant expensive and so so and the hotel shop so limited in its selection it makes a newsstand look like a Walt If you are attending a conference at McCormick Place stay elsewhere and take a cab  Youll pay no less than at this hotel but you will at least be able to walk to places and enjoy a choice of restaurants  
P => Underwhelmed Im here right now for a recruiting event and supposedly getting a quotdealquot for   I am not impressed  The room has a bit of an odd layout wherein as you enter the room you immediately walk into an open bathroom vanity and closet quotdoorquot area  Actually its not a closet door but a essentially a closet shower curtain  There is a good sized hole in the carpet behind the entry door revealing the concrete subfloor beneath  The sleeping area and bathroom area are arated by a weird partial wall  Not architectually interesting  Just a kind of strange  The walls seem to be pretty thin too  Last night I was awakened by a some very loud lhing that seemed to be coming from the floor above me  I could hear sneezing in the room next to me  The halls and elevator area at least on the th floor are quite austere  Just carpet and walls  No furniture or oration to be found  Lastly the toiletry items  I groaned a little when I saw they were Portico products which are exclusive I think to Hyatt  For the uninitiated these have the scent of quotwhite ginger quot I am not perfume phobic but this scent is so cloyingly sweet that my nose is tingling just thinking about it  It might appeal to some women but Id be surprised if any man would want to use it  I would suggest you bring your own soap Ive got some from the hotel I stayed in the day before yes if you have issues with strong scents  
P => Good If you have business at McCormick Place Spent two nights here for a trade show  The upside first hotel is clean my room offered a pretty nice view of Lake Michigan the bed was quite comfy the staff was nice and it is attached to the convention center The downside there is nothing to do around this hotel and it is about a  to  minute cab ride from downtown depending on time of day the hotel is in a tough neighborhood if fact I advise people do not go outside at night except to get a cab  There is no need to go outside between the convention center and the hotel since they are attached and well secured  I was also pretty surprised to see a   per day fee to use the internet  In  you would think this would be included in the room rate especially at   per night  
P => Amazing stay in a so so neighborhood I was upgraded to a suite at the McCormick Place which was absolutely stunning  The view of downtown Chicago was phenomenal  Staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly always willing to help out and anticipate your next move  Location of the hotel is not at all central and public transportation to the hotel is nonexistent  Not the fault of the hotel but still a downside  Overall a superb stay 
P => Wont Be Back Unless Im At A Trade Show At McCormick Place I just finished spending three nights in this hotel for a trade show and I must say Im less than impressed  Not with the staff    service here is impeccable  Not with the view    on the north side of the hotel the view of the Loop is incredible  The rooms are small but scrupulously clean with nice furnishings and firm comfortable beds  The restaurants here are terrific as well But complaints Ive got a few  For one cheap fuzzy quot CRT TVs when flat panels are so inexpensive these days  Another No microwave or fridge  This is a  room here Another virtually nothing to buy at the hotel convenience store  You have to drive a mile north to a Jewel at Michigan and Roosevelt to lay in snacks booze etc  for the room  Another stupid tiny useless pool  Another virtually nothing to do in the immediate neighborhood  It used to be a total wasteland around McCormick Place but the area is gradually filling in with housing so hopefully soon shops and bars and restaurants will follow  I mean its sad when theres way more to do around the convention center in DETROIT than there is in CHICAGO   and I should know Im from Detroit  Its also weird that in a city with a really good mass transit system theres no mass transit at this hotel or the convention center    the only way out of here is expensive cabs All told the only reason to stay here is if youre hooked up with a trade show at McCormick as I was  For regular pleasure travel to Chicago go to the Loop theres only about  better locations  
P => most hassle free check in and check out ever I recently spent one night at the Regency Hyatt McCormick Place while attending the Windy City Open DanceSport Competition held there  I thought that the rate was a good value  The room was well appointed and comfortable with a spectacular view of the Chicago skyline  The automated check in through a computer terminal in the lobby and check out through the television screen in room were my most convenient and hassle free check in and check out ever  I had dinner at the Shor restaurant pricy but good  I was at the hotel less than  hours but wish I couldve stayed longer and experienced more of the amenities  
P => Inexpensive enjoyable hotel I stayed at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place over the Lollapalooza weekend ust    I was there for the concert priily and to tour the city  I have to say this hotel worked out quite well  The rooms were in good condition though not outstanding  Servicesprices were what I expect from a typical businessconvention hotel expensive and not worth my time  I didnt try the food it was also on the pricey side  The room itself was incredibly inexpensive especially considering the busy weekend  I paid under  a night thanks to PL which considering the other options was a great value So now as to the location  I had no issues with the location whatsoever  I used  different types of transportation to get from the hotel to different parts of Chicago  By bus  There is a bus stop just outside the Hyatt  Several buses run by the stop  The   bus will take you up Michigan Avenue north to the Mag Mile area  It takes probably about  minutes to get to Grant Park and   minutes to get up to near the Hancock Center the end point of the route  The   bus will take you west to Chinatown but more importantly it will take you to the EL Red line in about  minutes and from there you can easily go all over Chicago   By cab  Cab rides were fairly inexpensive and fast  I had no problem getting a cab either going to or from the hotel  A ride from Grant Park cost  including tip  Very reasonable   By foot  While I didnt walk around the area at night during the day I found it quite enjoyable on the lakeshore  The hotel is close to Soldier Field if you are coming to see the Bears this would be an excellent choice for location and probably took me  minutes on foot  Also nearby is the Museum Campus area so the Field Museum the Alder Planetarium and Shed Aquarium  These three are probably another   minutes past Soldier field  Finally walking to the Grant Park area would take roughly   minutes taking the scenic lakeshore route or probably   minutes less taking a more direct street route  I would probably say the largest issue I had with the hotel was the surrounding area lacked in any and all ameneties  There were no close  minute walk restaurants bars or any nightlife whatsoever  You would be looking at the Loop for that at least  Still for sightseeing Chicago if you are the kind of person that takes off in the morning and stays out all day I would say this hotel is an excellent fit  You will likely save a lot of money compared to downtown hotels and not miss a thing  If you plan on coming back to your hotel often to changerestetc I would suggest something closer to the downtown area  Overall though I was very pleased with my time here  
P => Great for conference guests We stayed here for  nights as part of a conference which was being held in the hotel If you get a room with view of the city great but we werent and we felt wed missed out The rooms are ok clean well furnished but a bit dull and the coffee making facilities are wierd  paper cups and a drip through machine I wanted a kettle and china cups The room was well serviced daily The facilities of the hotel were ok but expensive breakfast cost is astonomical although there is a small Starbucks style outlet which is reasonable  There isnt much info about what is available in the centre apparently there is a McDonalds somewhere but we never found it The gym was superbly equipped as was the pool There is NOTHING you can walk to easily in the area  no shops bars or restaurants you really are stuck out in the midde of nowhere and due to time constraints we always had to get a taxi into the centre of the city at  dollars at time each way  I would take this cost into consideration if the hotel is cheaper than others located closer to the city  There was a bus stop just outside the hotel I think it was the number  which took you right into the city Chicago is a fantastic city and we would reccommend anyone stay there go to the cocktail bar in the Hancock tower at sunset the architectural boat tour check on booking a free walking tour with Chicago Greeters fireworks shopping along the Golden Mile and Water Tower  Superb trip 
P => Substandard service I stayed here for  nights because of a conference in the adjacent conference center  The hotel is in an unsafe neighbourhood and one of my colleagues was mugged just outside the hotel  It is in general a nice property with a good sized swimming pool but not as nice as other Chicago hotels at this price  I was annoyed by the fact that there is an extra charge for the internet that you have to pay hefty extra charges for teacoffee juice toast etc  at the breakfast buffet and that the room does not have a safe so you have to carry all your valuables around with you a particular risk in this neighbourhood or spend your day waiting for someone at the front desk to let you access their safe boxes  
P => gorgeous downtown and lake front views We stayed at the Hyatt Regency on y th after we had ided at the last minute to stay in Chicago for  nights instead of   Although we only stayed at the hotel for  night out of the  we wished we could have stayed there all  nights From the moment we walked inside the hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome  Everyone we met was extremely helpful and friendly  We stayed in room  which had a gorgeous view of both downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan The room was clean and very comfortable the hotel was beautiful and for us this was a great location as we had brought our bicycles and spent the majority of our mini vacation cycling along the lake front  We also took the free shuttle to Navy Pier for the fireworks and although there was a mix up getting our names on the list the staff made sure we were able to get on board We will absolutely return to this great hotel 
P => Great views not so great service Fabulous views of the chicago skyline and lake Michigan make up for the poor service at this nicely orated hotel  If you stay here be sure to ask for a room on a high floor with great views of the city  I almost wanted to stay in my room and just stare out the window  Although this property is not on the loop it still is located convenient to buses and the red line  Unfortunately housekeeping in the rooms is poor as evidenced by dusty furniture  I returned from a day of sightseeing to find my room the same as I left it that afternoon  I requested cleaning and they sent someone quickly but it was not a good job  It was worth the low convention price I paid of   
P => Best Staff Weve Encountered With an unmatched view of the Chicago Skyline we were also impressed by the helpfulness of the staff  Their knowledge of the city ensured we had a safe and family friendly weekend  The room was well appointed with space for this family of  to move around and everything was immaculately clean  We were a little disappointed that there was only  chair in the room no table and we were on the south side of the city so walking adventures had to start with a cab ride shuttle service is only one way and was booked for our entire stay  Those items were the only reason we did not give this hotel an quotexcellentquot rating  
P => Great hotel at resonable price We stayed here to go to a fundraiser at McCormick Place  The rates were very reasonable and the location was perfect  the hotel room was large and had a fantastic view of the lake  The front desk was very helpful and accomodating upon arrival and let us check in way early  The restaurant and bar of the hotel was the only downfall  Neither were very classy  Overall loved the stay  
P => Just Okay    With the Hyatt chain one usually expects to pay a little more but get more in the way of amenities and service  Well Id say it was a toss up with this hotel Im currently staying here as I write this review  My wife is attending a convention and have to admit that being connected to the convention center is VERY convenient  For those that complain about the bad location the hotel is here mainly to accommodate the traveler that is attending conventions NOT for those that want convenience to downtown  There are the Park and Regency Hyatts for that The room is actually quite nice  Double sinks and nice beds  But heres my first gripe while some  love the beds for me they are incredibly too soft Theres a pillow top and I get up in the morning with a back ache  Not sure if they have other types of bed  My wife is sleeping on the ground for the past few days  I dont think its because of me LOLSecond gripe is that the concierge staff is pretty useless  Theyre okay for simple things but they are definitely not up to snuff for really complicated things  Third gripe and a major one to me the shuttle runs once an hour  Thats fine theyll stop at the Museum Campus GREAT MUSEUMS Get the City Pass and youre set for several days worth of entertainment Navy Pier and WaterTower  But heres the glitch they dont pick up Whats up with that How much of a hassle is it to stop on the way out to pick folks up Geez Such a small thing that can make the stay here much more pleasant  To me its almost illogical to offer the pick up  Oh well   Fourth gripe the wait help in the restaurant Shor is terrible  We ate at the breakfast buffet for three days and every single day we had to rely on the assistants to serve us  And the only time wed see the waiter is when the bill came Hows that ided to give the tip directly to the assistant than leave anything with the bill Heres the good stuffHouse cleaning folks are very nice  Bring them a little something from your hometown and theyll great care of you  I think that means more to them than the standard tip but dont forget that tooFront desk is fairly efficient and cordial Rooms are clean and fairly nice Only costs about   to town for a cab Check out how much youll be paying for a shuttle the cab  be cheaper from Midway at least In conclusion for the price one pays for this hotel there  be better deals to be had but if youre coming for a conference its kinda hard to beat the convenience of being right here  
P => Good Business Hotel But Difficult to Get Downtown The lobby areas are all very nice and the hotel staff is well trained just like most other Hyatt properties  It seems like the hotel was a conversion from an old Holiday Inn because the ceilings on the guest room floors are low and the hallways look dated  The guest rooms were average and somewhat on the small side  This is very picky but I didnt like the fact that there was no closet door but instead a curtain over the closet The bar and restaurants had been remodeled since the last time I had stayed here  The bar is very nice and has a great drink selection My biggest gripe with the hotel is its location because it is so far away from anything and somewhat difficult to get downtown  
P => Nice hotel  not the best location My husband I stayed here for three nights for a weekend getaway to Chicago  The hotel was very nice  Our room was clean and updated  with a beautiful view of the city  My only complaint is the location     we wished we had been closer to the heart of downtown  where the restaurants and shops are  
P => Ok Hotel for business travel I stayed here for  nights in tember due to a conference in the hotel  My hotel rate was neogtiated for the conference   so Im not sure how much a regular person would pay  I took a taxi from midway airport for about  it was cheaper than the shuttles and it took about  minutes The hotel is connected to the conference center which is a nice feature if that is your purpose   if you are a tourist   i wouldnt pick this hotel due to its location  There were no restuarantsshoppingactivities near by at all   a taxi or car would be required should you want to do anything The hotel rooms were a nice size and looked like they had been updated recently  The bed was very comfortable  My view was of the conference center   nothing exciting  Try to get a waterfront room  Internet cost is   per day   it would be nice to have wireless in the rooms and since the rooms are expensive   it would be nice to have internet included in the price instead of as an extra charge The walls between the room and hallway are quite thin  Every night I could here other guests go into their rooms  This was especially annoying after the Bears game Sunday night  Guests were quite loud after midnight which woke me up I ate in the restaurants twice   the food was good but typical expensive hotel food  The conference food was fine too  The coffee shop is expensive  A bottle of water costs  for  pint  Go to the vending machines near your room     for  oz    much better deal  I dont know how much coffee was since I dont drink it  Overall my experience was fine but if you are a tourist   try to pick something more centrally located  
P => Great view We were at a conference in the adjacent McCormick Place Which is absolutely huge so budget time to get from your room to the conference which be be literally   indoors blocks awayThe room we got was on the st floor facing north towards downtown  We had Chicago at our doorstep and the view is really worth it  It is kinda far to walk a couple miles but we did actually walk via Soldier Field waterfront to downtown and onto the Miracle Mile  The cab back was  The room was nice and the bed comfy  No complaints about the size or furniture  the walls and doors do seem a tad thin so several nights we heard a lot of noise from outside  Wired internet is  as is the norm in many a Hyatt or other high end places  How come the cheap places has free internetMy main complaint is the public spaces in the lobby are so small and when you are getting out of a conference with hundreds of other people the lobby and elevator bay is crowded  The lines for elevators can be real long  The food is very pricey and eateries minimal  We did room service and enjoyed the food pricey but not much worse than at a tableThey do not have a shuttle to Midway airport so we had to pay a third party shuttle If i was going back to Chicago for pleasure i might pick a closer in hotel to downtown but this was very serviceble  
P => The Good the Bad not much Ugly    In town for conference  First great facilities for having meetings well laid out and easy to get to  No complaints there The Room You have to pay extra for the City View but it was worth it Saw the Navy Pier and the fireworks watched the Bears Game at Soldier Field on the stadium Jumbo tron great night views of the skyline No frig in room and I cannot believe they charge for Internet access   per day The beds were soft and very comfortable and the rooms are quotsurface cleanquot  just dont drop anything behind the bed YIKES  Quiet and relaxing otherwise The Food Bring Fort Knox reserves with you if you eat here  Very pricey and not so great  My steak was tough and charred on one side and the other menu items I ordered were mediocre at best  The front desk will give the menus of restaurants that deliver and they are worth the   delivery charge  Guidannos sp and a Chinese place nearby are very tasty and the delivery was fast  There is a Starbucks there and a small bag of Chex mix is   Transportation The hotel has a shuttle that will take you to the Navy Pier the Watertower Area and downtown but wont bring you back  Cabs ranged from   to    Too far away to walk anywhere  Next time I will stay downtown Recreation Went to Shedd Aquarium  Buy your tickets online and avoid the HUGE lines of people wo tickets  Very nice and well worth the price  So was the Field Musuem  The Navy Pier was fun and be sure to take a spin in the Ferris Wheel  All in all a good hotel just hindered by its unfortunate locationoverpriced unfortunate food  Great for conferences though  
P => Very nice hotel  Go Bears  Stayed at the Hyatt last night to attend a Bears game and the proximity to Soldier Field is perfect we walked there  The hotel itself was very nice and exactly what I expected  Our room and bed was comfortable although they were unable to fulfill our request for a King bed and we ended up with  queens  Paid  on Hotwire for the room and it was quite nice for what we paid  
P => Nice beds and bathrooms bad location The hotel was beautiful the beds were very comfortable and the double sink was very nice  However the walls were very thin and we got in trouble for being too loud  The only other bad thing is the location so far away from where we wanted to go  The free shuttle service only takes you to a few locations but it doesnt bring you back  And it only goes one time at every hour  Make sure you check your bill  I got charged for movies I didnt watch  I would recommend this hotel for business use but not for vacation with friends  
P => Fine for a convention I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place for two nights at a convention in ust   Paid  a night for the business plan   I dont think it was worth the extra  for breakfast at the restaurant  The rooms are standard Hyatt ent bed and sheets but nothing fancy  No room safe and  a day for high speed internet   a day for parking  The public areas were bright airy and clean and seemed to handle our group well  Not so for the one line coffee stand and the one restaurant for breakfast  There are no other options close to McCormick Place so the food there is the only game in town unless you want to drive or take a cab elsewhere  The guest floor hall on my floor was dirty and was not cleaned during my stay  All in all fine for the purpose but I would not go back for any other reason  
P => Ok Experience I made the reservations through hotwire at a rate of    I learned later that I could have got it for   or lower on priceline com The rooms are comfortable nothing fancy  I expected a little more from a Hyatt  I did request a room with a city view instead my room faced the opposite direction with wonderful view of illinois  The staff informed the city view rooms have an additional fee  I was kind of disappointed about that  The hotel is located few minutes from downtown Chicago  If you plan to take cabs its about  each way  The hotel does offer complementary shuttle services every hour but it get filled quickly  I would spend a little more and get a hotel in the loop you ll save the money from your cab rides  You can also take the   bus right in front of the hotel  You can buy  day passes that you can use for both the buses and trains from the hotel concierge  Great location if you plan to attend a conference at the McCormick Convention Center  
P => Great Hotel   Acceptable location but not great for tourists I booked this hotel through Hotwire just a few days before a last minute trip that I planned with friends  I typically prefer to use Priceline however I was continually shut out even with what I considered high bids for Chicago  The price that I got the hotel for on Hotwire was a great deal all things considered The hotel was nice and the staff was helpful and friendly  The rooms were spacious and clean  Ive stayed in hotels in Chiago before where the room was large enough for just the bed and a small path on either side  Our room here was definitely big enough for us The only staff that I had to talk to after check in was the house keeping staff  The in room coffee makers are only for a single cup of coffee and this is all the coffee that is typically provided  Hearing the housekeeping staff in the hallway I popped my head out and asked if we could have a few extra packets  She said no problem and gave me a few  When she made up our room after we left she provided extra packs for the next day as well As many have noted this hotel is a bit far south of downtown to be easily walked  The hotel does provide a few shuttle for guests however the two times that we tried to use it the signup sheet was full  There is the public bus the   that goes directly in front of the hotel and takes you up Michigan Avenue to at least the river and gets you there in about  minutes  On our first day in Chicago we purchased CTA transit cards so that we could use the El trainsubway and these work on the buses as well  
P => Love this Hyatt I have to recommend this hotel as a choice for accommodations when visiting or simply getting away in Chicago  The rooms while not extremely fancy are most comfortable and some of the room views especially of the lake are gorgeousThe staff is very pleasant and the service overall was exceptional  The rates are also reasonable for a hotel in Chicago very close to downtown Because I am a regular once for my birthday I had a card cake and fruit basket waiting for me at check in    it made my dayTry this hotel I guarantee youll like it 
P => Good Choice If You Get a Deal on Rates The rooms are cool and modern the staff is friendly the service is efficient and effective  I got the hotel for  per night on Hotwire and I feel I got a bit more than my moneys worth  I loved the citris and lavender shampoos and soaps The location is not the best for a tourist unless you can navigate public transit  Here are my tips for getting to sites from this hotel  Start off with the Chicago Transit Authoritys website at         In the left gin on the home page is a link to a trip planner section  All you need to do is put in your starting and ending locations and it will map out a route  The trip times were accurate in my case  They also give walking directions to the station and from the station to your final destination with the routes  This was the best preparation I did for my trip   Buy a CTA Visitors Pass  I bought a  day visitors pass for  at the train station at the OHare airport  I booked around town for my whole trip and only took two cabs so I ended paying only  for all my transit for three days    Get to know the   bus    It stops just outside the hotel go out the door and left down King drive half a block and runs along Michigan Avenue to where Chicago Avenue crosses  Busses come about every ten minutes on weekdays every twenty on weekends  It is a half hour ride to Chicago where all the fabulous north Michigan Avenue Shopping is a fifteen minute ride to the Roosevelt Avenue stop where you get off for the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum or to walk two blocks to the red orange or green train lines and about  minutes to get off at Jackson for the Art Institute of Chicago  The bus was pretty full each time I rode so expect to do some standing   Avoid the walk from the Hyatt to the Red Line  The walk from the CermakChinatown stop on the red line took me fifteen minutes at a brisk pace  Kind of a long drag with luggage  I walked it once at midnight too and that was a bad choice  Nothing happened but the route was pretty deserted save a couple of panhandlers  The next night I took a cab from the Roosevelt station the stop right before the CermakChinatown on the red line  and felt a lot better   Pick Up a Train Map  The trains were great  The trip from OHare to the hotel took an hour and ten minutes of train time the trip to Midway only twenty five minutes  Other than a twenty minute wait for the orange line train back to midway my train just pulled out as I was coming up the steps I never waited more than seven minutes for a train  I was able to get within four blocks of all of my destinations by train  I travelled alone and felt safe using the trains even late at night   Use the hotels shuttle if its on the hour  Since I had the transit pass I only used the shuttle once when I just happened to be in the lobby on the hour  You sign in at the guest services desk the shuttle runs  am to about  pm and stops at the museum campus the Navy Pier and the Water Tower all stops on the bus   route  It doesnt pick up though so it didnt do much for me  
P => Great service cool relaxing vibe  We got this hotel for  a night through Hotwire  It would have been  if we had not added a Monday night to the reservation  Service was top notch and exceeded expectations even for a  star hotel  The hotel is done in a modern style but everything is warm and relaxing rather than sterile feeling  They have really cool relaxing modern jazznew age background music in the public areas of the hotel  All of the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly  The desk staff was great  I could not find the concierge but someone from the staff saw me walk away followed me and was very helpful in figuring out my destination  Others have commented on the location of the hotel  It is very far south of the action but honestly was not that bad of a location  The museums and waterfront are nearby  On the second day we were made aware that you could possibly get through the convention center to get over the train tracks and Lake Shore Drive to get to the lakefront and walk up to the museums  We did not check this for ourselves  There is also a second Starbucks in the convention center  The nearby neighborhood is in the process of being built up with high end townhouses to the north and west  South still looked a bit dicey  There is a coffee shop and convenience store in the lobby  They had a great array of breakfast items to go and Starbucks coffee  They do have espresso drinks and this was a big plus since I dont drink regular brewed and that is usually all you can get at most hotels  We had a room on the th floor with a great view of the lake downtown and navy pier  Rooms are extremely nice but a bit small  The only cons were that the pool is meant more for laps than for kids using it  There is no hot tub either  The rooms could have made better use of the space by making the large closet and bench near the door go away and use some of that space to put chairs or a couch near the window to check out the view  If you have a north view room check out the old gothic building directly next to the hotel to the north  I think it is the old naval observatory building  It has some interesting architecture  
P => Do consider this hotel in Chicago Since this hotel is right next to the McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago it is the ideal location for attending any meeting at the Center  When all the other delegates have to catch a bus in the monring you will just walk m   luxuryEven if you are not attending a convention this hotel is in my opinion quite a good choice for Chicago  The next door Convention Center has a Metra station underneath   so train to Chicagos downtown is simple and quick  The hotel itself has good facilities and is only m from the lake shore  Taxis into town cost little from here   and compared to some of the downtown Chicago hotels the McCormick Place Hyatt is modern and well fitted out  I walked around the local area during the day and felt safe but most of Chicagos attractions museums shops architecture are a short taxi ride away  
P => Nice Hotel Horrid Location Good hotel if  and only if  you are going to a convention in McCormick Place  The hotel is located a long distance from any other attractions except Solider Field  It is on the northern edge of one of the worst south Chicago neighborhoods  Dont walk any where  Drive or taxi even if only a short distance The hotel itself is clean and modern  The staff was adequate  Our room faced the lake and had a nice view of Navy Pier which would have been good in the summer when they have the fireworks Despite the hotels features we will never stay here again because it is simply too far south of the restaurants and activities we want and the surrounding neighborhood is a disaster The self park garage was attached to the hotel and safe  for  hours  The hotel offers breakfast but most of the dishes are  which is pricey for eggs and toast even in Chicago  
P => welcome to the Projects We have just returned from a weekend trip to Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt In all honesty the hotel is fine  We had a King size city view room and other than the fact there was no fridge there was little to fault it The problem lies in its location If you are the type that gets in a taxi to take you and bring you back from places then the location does not matter in the least A trip to downtown works out a liitle under  one way The hotel website provides distances to the main attractions    DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFORMATION Walking to downtown is over  miles and you pass an area which is classified A PROJECT AREA so be on your guardThere is the No bus that stops outside the hotel and that takes you straight to the main downtown area where you can change buses for other destinations  If you are like us  after you have done the sightseeing bit and all you want to do is shower and go out for drinks and a bite to eat then this hotel wont be for you You would be better off downtown and we regretted not choosing one in or near the magnificent mile As a final note a cab to Ohare cost  
P => Great Hotel I booked this hotel through priceline com  a night for a room with two double beds  We were on the st floor with a great view of the lake and the city We arrived by train around am on our check in day and were allowed to check in right away The room was very clean modern and spacious  The window in the room was huge The pool area was very nice and when we swam we were the only people in the pool area The hotel has a lounge MX Lounge which is a tini bar that serves some food also  The tinis were   each but they were very good   although the quotLava Lampquot tini tasted a bit like cough syrup just because of the ingredients obviously no fault of the bartender  The lounge seemed to be a bit under staffed for a Saturday night  servers working the entire room so the wait time was long  Overall the service was great except the Guest Services desk seemed to be a little confused about their Shuttle I was told by one person that it ran to the Science and Industry museum and then told by another that it did not If you get a great deal on the room this is a wonderful hotel to stay at but if you pay full price and expect to go downtown quite a bit expect a   cab ride each way  Overall a very nice hotel but a little out of the way if you plan to go downtown quite a bit  
P => Great hotel if not a little expensive When arrived the bell boy was polite and took our bags the valet drove our car away he was also very friendly and professional  The hotel is large modern and spotless  The elevators were clean and very fast  We stayed on the th floor and had a great view our room was pretty clean and well equipped  The air conditioner was quiet if not under powered  The restaurant listed on the website had been remodeled into  new ones  One of them had very weird combinations of food for low prices and the other had chicken breast for  in a really nice and modern atmosphere  We chose the second one and were surprised at how well the service was  Next to the expensive restaurant  shor or something like that  there was a large sitting area and  escalators that were very intimidating and fast  A bit loud and distracting the escalators were yet again spotless  Throughout the hotel was this new age ish music playing    its cool for a while but can get annoying  The exercise center has top of the line equipment and complimentary water   the pool is smallish and warm  Overall the hotel was really nice and empty when I was there and the staff would be very nice   depending on how nice the tip was  
P => Nice hotel We stayed at the Hyatt McCormick place for a trade show      We were there early and were checked in by  am the staff that helped us put us on the st floor facing the city we had a comanding view of the Chicago Skyline  Navy Pier Soldier Field Shedd aquarium and the planitaraium  We were given vouchers for full breakfast at the in house restaurant quotshorequot which was excellent food with the endless glass of fresh squeezed OJ     the restaurant is pricey so breakfast for two was at least   a day      Also ate at the adacent food place and food was casual but excellent dinner at shore was excellent also    Room was typical for this type of hotel as far a size goes    small bathroom arate sink area and nice linens on the beds   best part was the view     IT was cold so we didnt go out to dinner while there and there were only two places to order take out that would deliver to the hotel  one chinese passable but not great and one pizza  stuffed pizza was great     but other than than not many dining options on a cold snowy night unless you head to town in a  to  minute ride  The train runs through the McCormick Place and you could catch it into town also     All in all the stay was good  staff was very helpfull and food at hotel was excellent It is connected to the convention center so we didnt have to go outside during the show days     being from Hawaii and   in Chicago         that was a definate plus 
P => Nice business trip hotel Stayed at the Hyatt for a  day business trip  It is centrally located and is in close proximity to the lake  The fitness center was really nice but they wanted  to do a swim workout in the pool next door  The rooms are very nice and if you ask they will give you one with a view  The food inthe lobby restaurants and bars are ent and reasonably priced for a city hotel  I will definitely stay here again  
P => Ok for a business trip This is not a tourist hotel  The Hyatt McCormack is off the beaten path and you cannot walk to any shops or restaurants from the  I was staying at the Hyatt for a  day convention which the hotel was suited perfectly for  Rooms were clean service was good and the beds were comfortable  The reception offered automatic rooim key card kiosks for check in which was really convenient  The health club is mediocre not nearly as nice as other properties  The loungebar area is adequate with TV s for sports and basic pub food  Chicago is a wonderful destination   I would just recommend a more convenient location if you are going for a fun filled visit  
P => mixed bag Definitely a nice hotel with well appointed rooms but unfortunately a few negatives  Stayed there for the Chicago athon and the location as many others have noted is not ideal for visiting downtown although great for events at McCormick Place or Soldiers Field  Our room was large and comfortable  We were disappointed to find there was no hot tub although the lap pool was nice  The locker room for the pool and fitness center had only one shower which was less than adequate for a huge hotel filled to capacity with runners  Front desk personnel were all nice and helpful and the concierge was great at securing dinner reservations and providing bus and train info  Loved the kiosk in the lobby where you could print your airline boarding pass and check on the weather where you were going  The biggest drawback was the housekeeping staff  We had been out of our room since  am for the race and did not return until nearly  pm  The room had not yet been made up  We were exhausted and laid down for a nap after putting out the privacy notice  Shortly after the phone rang with housekeeping wanting to get in and clean the room  I did not appreciate being roused from sleep and ousted from my room  I did complain later and the customer service rep was most apologetic and promised to notify the manager of this  
P => What a relaxing weekend I am a travel agent and I just recently got a chance to get away on my own mini vacation as they are very far and few in between  I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick  I picked this location because I wanted to make sure to avoid the hustle and bustle everyday during my stay  I wanted to be close to the action but not right in the middle of it  This was the perfect place  When I got there it was right off the highway so you couldnt miss it  The lobby was very nice  It has great neutrals and plush carpets and high polished or  The staff was very courteous and very efficient  If there was a wait they made sure to let you know that this was not a common occurrence  I stayed on a weekend so I expected a crowd at this convention hotel but was pleasantly surprised  Anyway I had requested a room on a high floor since I planned to spend most of my time sightseeing from my room and was given a very nice room on the th floor  The rooms are clean and Im very very particular about where I sleep  I love the way the room has the divider wall that arates the  sink vanity from the rest of the room  The beds and linens are plush and the room is very relaxing yet will accommodate the business traveler without a problem  To my surprise the bathroom was great Normally you  see water stains or mildew or other signs of half cleaning but I didnt see any of that at this hotel  Breakfast was great as well  I ordered off the menu but my companion went to the buffet and got just as much as I did and probably even a better selection  The grounds were well manicured and there was always someone cleaning  Thats very big for me I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Almost perfect We stayed Hyatt Regency McCormick Place for two nights and didnt have any issues  The room was nice the lobby was nice the staff was helpful  The only complaint and its a minor one was the bathroom the counter was small which left little room for personal stuff and there wasnt a vent so the room got quite steamy and humid when taking showers  But of course that didnt ruin the stay at allAs others have said it is not downtown or really within walking distance of much  However the   CTA Bus will take you right down Michigan and the Metra will take you the other way  We took a cab home from Rush St one night and it only cost   We had no problem getting anywhere Overall I recommend the Hyatt McCormick  
P => This Hyatt is   McCormick Place so dont expect to be downtown if you stay here So many reviews of this hotel fault it by its location but excuse me but I thought you should at least know where your hotel is located before you book it No it is not downtown so dont stay here if you want to be in the Loop  This hotel is within in walking distance of Soldiers Field the Field Museum the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium  The hotel itself is clean the rooms are in good shape the staff was friendly and the food in the Networks restaurant was good at breakfast on the Sunday we ate there I would stay there again  
P => Would not intentionally stay here  Several coworkers and myself were attending a conference at the McCormick Center and put up at the hotel by our agency Upon entering the lobby it appears to be a beautiful hotel and checked in with an ease  I entered my room my smell senses were overpowered with some sort of carpet fresh fragrance  I am sensitive to smells more so than mostI called down to the lobby and they readily agreed to put me in a different room  The first room was on the th floor with a beautiful view  The second room was on the st floor with also great view  The second room smelled worse than the first  It had an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke as if the room next door was smoking and we were sharing the same air vent  It was not a nonsmoking floor This time I went down to the lobby  The staff was always extremely helpful during my stay  They never once acted agitated towards me  Explained to the desk clerk and he said that he would put me in a room on the th floor as the floor had been recently remodeled  It worked as the smells were neutral   Lost my view but I was happyBefore I had left home I had read the reviews on this site  Once I had settled in the room I could see why the hotel received such poor reviews My list  Mold in the shower and no fan in the bathroom clumps of hair on the hair dryer tooth paste looking salvia in the bottom of the water glass check those room glass it looks like they sometimes recycle them without washing them  dusty scuff ks on walls opened window and cigarette ashes flew in the room no safe paper cups for the coffee phones were old and dirty in the last two rooms the carpet was ripped and had snags to trip over But I was still happy with the room  I did phone the manager of house keeping and he came up to the room  I informed him of this site and pointed out the things mentioned above as they are almost all fixable He offered a bottle of wine and chocolates and I accepted The next morning I got up and put the dirty glasses including the one with white stuff on the bottom on the edge of the counter to show they had been used  I came back to the room in the afternoon and to my surprise the maid had turned the glasses upside down and placed them back to be used again  There sat that toothpaste salvia glass  I called two maids into the room and the maid who had clean the room tried pulling the glass out of my had  Told her I wanted to keep it  Called the manager and left a phone message about the glass Went for an hour conference in the afternoon and came back to the room  The maids had been in for the second time and had doused the bathroom with bleach  The whole room was overpowered with bleach smell and the glass was gone  I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and to be switched again because of the smell The next room smelled fine and was about in the same shape as the last one  The fiscal was over  Had dinner one night at the restaurant and the food was good would recommend the lobster bisque  Ate at the breakfast buffet and this was mediocre  Fresh coffee and orange juice but you pay   and   a glass or cup The location of the hotel is poor however public transportation and the hotel provide economical means to get downtown  Not everyone is comfortable taking the bus though  We did use public transportation and it was user friendly but took a cab one late evening for a cost of about   plus tip  It is a   cab ride to the airport Again the staff was all great  The conference center was excellent and user friendly On a scale of  to  I would rate it a   I would stay there again if I were going to a conference but not for any other reason  It is not a good value for your money  
P => Great Experience at a Convention Center Hotel Fantastic staff wonderful service great view of downtown Lake Michigan and Soldier Field As an exhibitor at a medical show in uary I had a Regency Suite for my  day stay  The suite was spacious and clean although the furniture in the livingdining area was a little dated and worn However the bedroom was a nice size comfortable betting and nice bathrooms  The staff was courteous and very helpful for my entire stay  Our company had a lot going on in the suite which served as a meeting room and hospitality area as well and the food was good and delivered timely  I was able to check in early and when checking out the complex billing split between two credit cards was handled with ease A special thanks to Jimmy in the package area who went beyond the call of duty to retrieve a mis shipped package  I ended up with over  packaged shipped to my attention at the hotel and Jimmy was incredibly helpful in alerting me and allowing me to keep some of the boxes in the holding area  
P => Hyatt is Good to Me I am currently staying in the Hyatt and the room I have on the  floor overlooking the lake  The room is nice service is good  Parking is expensive  Package Deal average of night  airfare good price priceline  Location not easily accessible to Michigan not in walking distance  Overall I would stay here again if the price is under  night  
P => A nice stay in a Convention Centre Hotel I stayed in the Hyatt with my husband for  nights last week  I was attending a Conference in the Hotel  We found the staff to be very efficient friendly and polite The room was clean and modern and we had a great view of the lake from our th floor room We ate in the hotel  nights  The first night my main course was cold so they took it back and when it re appeared it was still cold so I just abandoned it at that stage  Our waiter was very nice about it although it was a bit disappointing  The following night we ate in the bar and as a vegetarian they facilitated me with a lunch time dish of lentil chilli   highly recommended  Ray the waiter was also really pleasant amp efficient There was a little shop in the foyer that sold Starbucks coffee a great treat for those of us from overseas and their DanishespastriesBagels were really fresh and delicious My husband used the shuttle service into town to do his sightseeing and the found the driver to be really pleasant We took a taxi into town one night for dinner and it worked out at about dollars each way which was fine We paid c dollars a night for the hotel and while this sounds more expensive than a lot of the deals other guests obtained I felt it was a good price for the standard of the hotel  The hotel was also ideal for attending the Conference in the Convention centre and I would happily recommend this hotel if you are attending a Convention in McCormick Place  
P => good food and service except for maid scary spiders This hotel is OK for business customers who need to be at the Convention Center next door but not for pleasure or children  We were on the th floor with a great view of the White Sox field and saw a good fireworks display both nights that they won  The problem with the view was that there were a half dozen big live spiders hanging out in front of the window which was odd given that we were on the th floor Of course I was not about to open the window  You can open the windows although there is a sign not to open the window  But I would not like to have any children with me who just might actually open it  The service was good except for maid service  We started out with  towels  wash cloths and a bath mat  The next day we had  towels  wash cloths and a bath mat  The last day we had  towels  wash cloths and no bath mat  The other thing is that the bottom sheet is not fitted and kept coming off the bed  It was only tucked in at the top and sides and left about  feet of the bottom uncovered  So your feet were on the mattress pad or on the mattress itself  Very weird  There is a shuttle to downtown but the windows are painted over so you can barely see where you are going and the shock absorbers are non existent so the ride is very jarring  Also the shuttle will drop you off but not pick you back up so you need to find your own way back to the hotel  Cabs in Chicago are easier to find than any city I have ever been in so take cabs  Make sure you specify the Hyatt Regency quotat McCormick Placequot to the cab driver or you  end up at the wrong Hyatt The restaurant was too cold for my  year old mother so we usually had room service  The food was very good  There is smoking in the lounge which is only arated by the dining room by a partial wall  If you do not like smoke while eating ask for a table away from the lounge  
P => Great Value Booked this hotel through priceline roughly  with all the taxes this was way cheaper than booking off the hotel site  It is an upscale hotel that would be best for convention goers located right next to McCormick Place  But this was also very close for us as we were attending an event at Solidier Field and going to Shedd Aquarium The hotel was very clean and the service was very good the only complaint that we had was it was hard to reach the vallet via the phone in the room but when you went downstairs they were very prompt  The room also had a good view of the city skyline and you could see the lake  
P => Beautiful view great service We stayed at this hotel and we were very pleased with our visit  Our room was very clean and everyone at the hotel was incredibly helpful and nice  The food in the restaurant was excellent  We had an amazing view from the st floor that overlooked both the city skyline and the lake  While the hotel is a little away from the sights downtown or by the lake the lower price we paid for our room  compared to a downtown hotel made up for this inconvenience  And since the hotel is attached to the convention center you can walk across the pedestrian bridge and easily get to Lakeshore Drive  We ended up walking back from the aquarium to the hotel which was just a couple of miles and on a nice day isnt a bad walk  We will definitely stay at this hotel again The only drawback is the price of parking but we think the price of parking around any part of Chicago is outrageous We paid  to park in the hotel garage and then took a cab or walked to the places we visited  
P => Not too shabby I stayed at the Hyatt over Memorial Weekend  The hotel was beautiful Check in was pretty quick despite the large number of people checking in  The house keeping service was exceptional  I lost my purse within the first  minutes of being there  Of course I was frantic The housekeeping staff returned my purse   with everything in it  I was totally grateful to them  I thought the place was awesome  My only complaint is the location  It is not within walking distance of much  You have to take a shuttle city bus or taxi to get to the attractions  A bonus is that it is within walking distance of the lakefront which is gorgeous  It is close to the stadium and planetarium but you have to do a little walking  I liked the hotel but I would not stay there again simply because I like a hotel that is in the midst of everything  I love the hotel It is gorgeous and you couldnt ask for a better place  I highly recommend it to everyone except for the issue with location  Also parking is  for up to  hours and valet parking is   The city bus is     I cant quite remember  
P => Far away from the action but comfortable We stayed here for a visit after getting the reservation through Priceline  Although you are south of the attractions  this hotel is doable with the bus stop   that stops right in front of the hotel  Just takes a while to get to the loop   min drive and time to wait for the bus The hotel has a shuttle on the hour but doesnt leave until  am  We were long gone by then  Drop off only service to navy pier and loop  The hotel was comfortable beds spacious rooms and nice restaurant great shower starbucks right in the hotel  Clean and new  There was some noise in the hall but security came right up and we didnt hear another thing the whole night There are no metro stops within walking distance the closest one is through a seedy questionable area 
P => Just what we were looking for Im not sure why so many people have issues with this property  We stayed two nights during a show at the convention center next door very convenient and we found this hotel to be just fine  Check in was easy and friendly  Bags arrived at room promptly  Valet service for car was fast every time we needed it  Room was nice we had a corner and had all the usual amenities  A family we traveled with got stuck in the elevator and when they returned to their room that night they found wine muffins and an apology note  We were initially put in a room near an elevator  the next morning when I checked to see if we could switch to a different room the response was yes and that was that  Very easy  Are the walls thin be but thats often the case  Is the restaurant overpriced Yes  Is the coffee shop overpriced Yes  But thats typical of a big city hotel  No theres not much around the property  It wouldnt be my first choice if Im visiting the city to walk Michigan Avenue  But for an event at the convention center its just fine   
P => Works for Me In a very recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Mccormick place I found the hotel to be very bright and full of natural light  Our room was found to be nearly perfect and the staff all around the hotel actually smiled   something I am not used to very often  Location is about ten minutes from the hot spots downtown and perfect for our show at the convention center  All around the hotel   I was pleased with our choice and would make this hotel first on my list anytime traveling to downtown chicago  Thanks Hyatt  
P => Stayed here before   but disappointed this time Ive stayed at this property before and had good comments  I cant say the same this time around  While the food and service are always very good the housekeeping left much to be desired  I stayed a total of  days and had my sheets changed once  Yes I complained mid week  Nothing was done  Additionally I was given one bar of soap to use between the bath and the sink for the entire week  This is not acceptable from a Hyatt  However I must note that the staff in the Networks restaurant is outstanding  The host is very friendly and the wait staff did an excellent job  They are a  star group  Location is king for this property since it is connected to the McCormick Place  I would probably stay here again for this reason but I will make sure that housekeeping does a better job next time around  
P => A pleasent stay After reading the reviews of the hotel I was very hesitaint about staying here  My son had a two day volleyball tournment at McCormick Place  the hotel is attached to the convention center and it just made sense to stay at the hotel  I was told that a special rate was available for the tournment but when I made the reservation thru Haytt I was not able to get it  I had to reserve the room at a AAA rate that was not bad When we arrived I was pleasently suprised by the hotel  It had a nice lobby and the staff was very friendly and informend me that I received with my AAA rate a   day credit that could be used for meals  Our room was quite large and CLEAN and had one of the best views of the city that I have seen  We were on the th floor looking north up Michigan Ave  The bathroom was good size and the beds were not uncomfortable I was actualy looking for something wrong and the only thing I could find was the light on the desk did not work Waking up the next morning it was nice to be able to walk to the tournment without leaving the building At the tournment I found out from some of the other people staying at the hotel that the special rate was available and I should have been able to get the rate when I booked the room  I was on my way to the front desk expecting a hard time  When I informend them of the situation they were very nice apologized and made the changes to the rate  It was about   per night in savings The second day of the tournment had the chance of running late  I asked if it was possible to get a late check out  Again it was no problem and extended my ckeck out time with a smile I must say my stay was very nice I do agree that the hotel is not very convient to the city  It is not walkable to restaurants or any of the citys attractions  You have to take a cab about   downtown or use your own car  The hotel was designed for the convention center and it seems to serve that purpose well  
P => this is a Hyatt Our company booked rooms for us while we worked at the convention It took four tries to get me a room  First they quotlostquot my reservation then I was sent to a parlor room then to a smoked in non smoking room then on to a room next to a suite that was full of convention types then finally to a quiet room in a corner of the hotel  The front desk staff tried to make up for it and sent up a complimentary cheese and fruit spread  The cheese and fruit were dried and stale  Nice try The elevators What a joke we waited forever in line to get into the elevators  This hotel is a pit  Avoid it at all costs  The front desk staff is weak The best thing about this hotel   the bellman and the concierge I was also billed for   in additional costs after my checkoutand they cannot produce a receipt Stay the the Palmer House  
P => Never again       One of the worst hotels Ive experienced especially considering the price  The walls are paper thin and I could hear everything in the next room and hall despite my request for a quotquietquot room  The lobby is nice but no effort was put into the guest rooms  Furniture is old and well worn  The bed didnt have a mattress pad and the comforter had visible stains  I will never stay at this hotel again  
P => Used and abused Hotel  
P => Great view but out of the way location     
P => Nice Hotel Good Location for Conventions  otherwise a little far out  
P => It is a nice hotel   
P => loved the view  
P => Quiet  
P => Problems in hotel restaurant  
P => Buen hotel para asistir a ferias  
P => Odio el hyatt  
P => 
P => Great location but old and shows it Obviously Chicago hotels have a lot of turer due to conventions and general tourism  However this shouldnt stop hotels from updating their buildings  While my wife and I have stayed at the Inn at Lincoln Park several times over the past few years our last visit will probably be the last Despite the great location less than a mile from the water  cab ride to downtown bars and stores  including Starbucks  nearby the owners have let the place go  While it hasnt been quotnewquot by any stretch since weve started staying here on yearly visits to the city the quotold world charmquot as another reviewer mentioned is something of the past  Instead of old world its simply old  Our room granted only  for the city and parking is extra but we paid less for a MUCH better and newer room in the burbs had peeling wallpaper cracked walls and ceilings obvious poorly done patch jobs and water stains  The bed was horrible as well That being said the bathroom was immaculate  which is nice  Additionally the front desk staff was pleasant to deal with If youre looking for a place to spend an hour a day in then this could be your hotel  I would give it a try if you can get a room for   Otherwise try to check other area hotels  I know we will  
P => If youre looking for comfort and some modern conveniences THIS IS NOT IT If you like a hotel that you spend almost  to be comfortable DO NOT STAY HERE Just stayed for one night t    Most of the hotels in town were booked and we thought for  and discovering a new neighborhood for us in Lincoln par would be fun  I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night  Yes its old but apparently that also means dumpy  Postage stamp for an elevator narrow dark hallways and dark old rooms with an old TV and an outdated bathroom that really needs some bleach Our room was a smoking tried to save  and boy did it stink Our air conditioner didnt actually cool very well and made a funny noise ALL night  The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs  The staff were not friendly saw them give attitude to another guest who did not want to stay once he actually saw the rooms  Next time stay at the Club Quarters in the loop for the same price  
P => We keep returning This older hotel is not for you if cookie cutter predictable rooms are what you need to feel comfortable  For an extra night you can have  hour in and out parking  provided there is a space in their enclosed lot  Otherwise you park just for overnight in a garage somewhere down the block  Breakfast cold cereals yogurt pastries microwaveable cooked eggs sausages bacon is included in the price  We generally come here in uary for a conference at Northwestern and the radiator heat is sometimes inadequate  If you are feeling cold call the desk and they can bring a portable electric radiator  Nice big old tub cable TV plenty of restaurants in walking distance  A good deal for a reasonable price  
P => Great Stay Hotel room was large and clean with a wonderful old time atmosphere  Perfect location  One review mentioned quotDont expect a hot shower in the morning quot We had no troubles with the shower getting very hot  Front desk girls were very nice   fresh fruit cookies coffee and tea available in the lobby   Full breakfast   waffles french toast yogurt sausage patties egg patties bacon hard boiled eggs cereal donuts pastries bagels muffins with a variety of beverages and condiments  Several of the items were presented cold and needed to be warmed in the microwave   this was not an issue  Check out Matisse just down the street between the brown line stop and the hotel   great food and cozy atmosphere  Would definitely stay here again  Price was  per night  Higher than we wanted to pay but the best deal for the money and a good deal for the location  
P => Old Hotel Charm What a charming old hotel  While the king sized bed filled up most of the room my wife and I loved the old style beauty including the porcelain pedestal sink  The location allowed us to to travel on foot to Wrigley Field and the Lincoln Park zoo  We definitely plan to return again next year  
P => Charming clean and in an unbeatable location I have to admit I wasnt expecting much due to all of the negative reviews but not only was I pleasantly surprised I fell in love with the Inn For all of you who are hesitant due to previous reviews and their lack of a fancy website dont be put off and reserve yor room now  The Inn isnt your cookie cutter Hilton but a charming Parisian like jewel in a trendyfun neighborhood  It has the feel of a European hotel with a very friendly staff a nice complimentary breakfast each morning complimentary cookies amp coffee in the lobby  hours a day and antique light fixtures throughout  We got the last room at the Inn and when I was making my reservation she warned me that the room was small so I anticipated tiny but it was just fine  There was a large closet for our bags and everything was clean which is important  Some reviews said quotold and dirtyquot well it  be older but nowhere did I see dirty and I am a clean fanatic  Some folks just mistake old for dirty and I guess in that case old homes and old brownstones and old furniture are all dirty  If you dont like charming and prefer cold and bland then stay elsewhere but if you want to feel comfort amp quaintness and be in an amazing location thats just a short walk to Wrigley Field then this is the place to be 
P => LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION I was a little hesitant to book a room here after reading the reviews but ided that the location would make up for any problems  A year ago I stayed downtown and was very unimpressed with one of the five stars The reception I received was very nice  The staff at the desk were very helpful and answered all of my many questions pleasantly  They even did some investigation for me when I asked about a specific church where my parents were ried  years ago  My blind father and I were given a rather nice room and the bathroom was HUGE We had a small coffee maker and a refrigerator  The room was clean  The or is definitely old but charming  The beds were comfortable and clean  I was very pleased not to have feathers in the room allergy which I made note of on my reservation  We had many channels on the TV to choose from  We did not need to use the window air conditioner Breakfast was FREE       and considering not bad  It is a self serve style buffet  If you want eggs bacon waffles etc  they were available but you had to microwave them yourself  Bagels muffins donuts cereal coffee tea juices etc  were all there for you  The breakfast room was very pleasant and clean  The attending staff were pleasant  I accidentally dropped a whole cup of juice       they rushed over to clean up my spill and just would not hear of it when I tried to clean it up myself Fresh fruit was available in the lobby  hoursday along with coffee and tea  Cookies were available in the afternoon Internet access was available       free connection in the lobby a free computer also available  I dont understand why internet access in the rooms incurred a charge All staff were aware that my dad was blind and they were very kind and helpful when he was navigating the hotel alone Parking was right outside the lobby door and a back up garage was available if the parking lot was full  I did not need to use the garage  Sadly this hotel is scheduled for demolition in three or four years and will probably be replaced with something outrageously expensive  Overall this hotel was just what we needed  Not fancy but nice people clean surroundings safe and in an excellent location  
P => Great little hotel in the heart of LakeviewLincoln Park area This is an older hotel but we thought it was great  The staff was always cordial and greeted us each time we returned  We had a nonsmoking room with  double beds room  and we had  full bathrooms   unheard of in any hotel Ive stayed in  The bathrooms were small but having two is a luxury when traveling with a teen  We did not have a car this hotel was a short walk from the Diversey Station El from Midway  The continental breakfast was great eggs bagels muffins donuts yogurt fruit hot and cold cereal sausage and bacon  They had a nice lobby and a secure door that always required a key to access the hallway leading to the rooms  We chose this hotel because our dhter lives within  blocks  It is in a wonderful area surrounded by restaurants shops and residential areas  I was pleasantly surprised and I would definitely stay there again  
P => Dont expect a hot shower in the morning My fiance and I recently stayed at this hotel and our experience was less than satisfactory  Our room including  for parking came to US for a Saturday night which I deemed reasonable for this location in Chicago  The hotel is walking distance to shopping and restaurants the lakefront El and not too far from Wrigley Field or the downtown loop  We chose the hotel based on location and availability  When we got to our room it had an awful stale smell to it and the carpet had a worn gummy feel to it  The room was far from spacious and the or is quite dated   The problems arose when my fiance tried to shower in the morning  There wasnt any hot water at  am so i called down to the front desk  They sent maintenance to check for any cause but none was found  We were told to let the water run for a couple of minutes which we did  My fiance attempted to shower anyway and did actually get some lukewarm water for a couple of seconds before the water pressure reduced to a dribble  My second call to the front desk garnered an offer for a shower in another room on the same floor which we lined  My fiance used the cold water in the bathroom sink to wash  I tested the water in the shower several times while she readied herself and never did warm water run   I spoke with the on duty manager in person about the situation and our displeasure  I stated that when we choose a hotel we are expecting to receive similar ammenities that we enjoy in our own home and that includes a warm shower  She said that she could understand our situation and assured us that we would receive a partial refund on checkout  When the time arrived we were offered a  refund on the parking fee not by the on duty manager that I had spoken to earlier but another member of the front desk staff  I then proceeded to explain the situation calmly to her and my wishes to speak with the on duty manager  She called the manager and relayed her message to me that the parking fee would be the only gesture we would receive for our inconvenience  I feel the price this hotel charges for its rooms can only be justified in times of desperation  The manager that I dealt with represented this establishment poorly and I would not recommend The Inn at Lincoln Park to anyone with expectations greater than a second rate hostel  
P => OK We stayed one night because it was near our dhter who has an apt  in Lincoln Park  The hotel is old not in a charming way just a sort of worn out way  The carpet curtains bedspread furniture etc  are kind of worn and dated  Our room was small and very tight for the two of us there was only around  inches between the end of the bed and the bureau the TV was perched on so we had to walk sideways in that spot  The bed was small and lumpy  However the room was clean and the bathroom was fairly large  The staff was friendly and they had a continental breakfast included  I probably wouldnt stay here again and would only recommend it if you have a reason for wanting to be in that area  It wasnt bad but there are better choices in that price range  Try the Essex Inn on Michigan Ave  
P => Great Place I went to Chicago on an extended weekend and stayed at the Inn  I loved it The lobby has such a warm feel to it and its walking distance to several shops restaurants the El ect  The room size was extremely accomodating with two beds and eate area for the desk and clothes and a bathroom with a full size tub and orated in a way that reminded me of the s s  It felt more like an apt than a hotel room  The staff were amazing and helped me with soooo much while in the city  They had parking available at a cheaper rate than paying for a garage which is extremely convenient in Chicago  Well be back there again   and soon 
P => Clean pleasant cheap great location This place was great It was charming and spotlessly clean and the women at the front desk were awesome going out of their way to give us directions and recommendations of sights to see  If you like the sterility of a chain hotel this is not the place for you  But if you enjoy the charm of an old building check it out  We were in Room  which had two small bathrooms and two double beds  TV worked fine and had cable  The bathrooms are tiny and the shower was tricky alternating from very hot to very cold  But it was worth it to be in the heart of Lincoln Park  Easy walk to Wrigley Field  The continental breakfast was excellent with cereal yogurt bagels donuts juice and coffee  Plus there were carnations on the table which was a nice touch  Wed definitely stay there again  
P => Nice Clean Place My husband amp I stayed  nights in y   We had a very nice room the size was plenty for  people  The bathroom was spacious also  Everything was clean  It has an older atmospheric look but well kept  The continential breakfast was very nice  Location is excellent with plenty of restaurants shopping and things to do  We would definately go back again  
P => Ehhhhhhh  Stay somewhere else  We stayed at the hotel for  nights on a guys weekend to catch a few baseball games  So needless to say we picked a cheap hotel for our trip  And this was a cheap hotel  And as soon as you walked in the door you saw it was cheap  I know Chicago is expensive for hotels but this was a dumpy looking place I cant really say there was anything horribly wrong with it but I felt like I was in a very sub prime hotel that hasnt had anything fixed since the s  I do not think it was been updated in  years so everything is very old  Not old in the good way but old in the way of nothing runs easy RoomsWe were in room  which had  bathrooms  That was helpful with a room full of guys  The room was longer and narrow so there wasnt a lot of room at the end of the beds to walk  They has window AC units and ours sucked  It ran full tilt the whole time and it was barely enough BathroomsIt was strange  The doors hit the toilets so you can guess how much room was in there  The showers were worse  I could never get consistent pressure from day to day so one day it was a nice stream then the next a drip  Oh and it would totally lose all hot water some times  Plus the knobs were so old it was a production to get the shower on TVIt was circa   It did have digital cable with a box but it was old and small BreakfastFree with donuts cereal yogurt apples and a few other things  This was the skimpiest continental breakfast I have every had at a hotel in the US  It wasnt stale or anything just very few choices  Front deskNot overly helpful  They did give us the wrong directions once OverallThey try to make it look nice by saying its a s building well it was easy to tell that when I got there and looked around for  minutes  Everything is worn in this place  Even the couches in the lobby are in bad shape  Like worse then college apartment shape The area is great with a lot of eat and get places  Its  blocks for the train stop and on the Diversy bus line This hopefully will be my last time at this hotel  There is a Days Inn half a block up and I think it had the same rates  Id stay there next time Oh I forgot there were bare wires in our room  They were telephone wires but they were still bare and sticking out of the wall  
P => Good Hotel We had a very nice stay at the Inn at Lincoln Park in y  My mother  year old dhter and I were in town for a few days while I was looking for an apartment  I used to live in Chicago so I know the area and understand what a deal we got for  a night When we arrived a few hours earlier than the check in time the friendly staff said no problem and let us check in  We found a spot to park in the attached lot which isnt difficult during the day but near impossible after pm  When a parking spot isnt available in the lot you then need to park in a garage about  block away not bad  The parking is  whether youre in the lot or garage  When unloading our stuff we were given a luggage cart which was invaluable with all the crap you need to bring for a  year old child When we opened the door to our room we were pleasently surprised with a large room a erate area containing a desk and a fridge  The bathroom was clean linen fresh bed comfortable and TV worked great  The air conditioner took a while to cool the room down once we turned it on but it was a steamy  degrees outside  The continental breakfast served from am am was fantastic  It contained cereal muffins bagels w cream cheese fantastic doughnuts yogurt fruit and best of all fresh coffee As if that wasnt enough there was a Panera directly accross the street and a Starbucks next door We took about a  minute walk to the lake and had access to public transportation to go anywhere in Chicago Above all its a clean slightly outdated friendly and well priced place to stay when exploring Chicago  
P => Neighborhood Is Great Hotel Is Fair As an former Chicagoan who lived rather near this hotel which btw is technically in the Lake View neighborhood not Lincoln Park we stayed over for one night while taking our high school dhter on a campus visit to the University of Chicago  Once in our room my husband reminded me wed actually stayed in the same room some   years ago    and I dont believe the management has changed a single thing in all that time Other reviewers have complained about this hotels distinct quotold buildingquot feel while still other reviewers have praised it for that very reason  We are a family that very much appreciates the quirky charm of old buildings and are happy to make allowances accordingly    but thats not the same as saying we appreciate  unkempt  old buildings We stayed in Room  a nonsmoking room that looked out over the small parking lot off Diversey Pkwy  Alas we were neither lucky nor early enough to score a space there and instead had to put our car in the nearby Century Shopping Mall garage at the hotels  overnight rate    a good price I grant you  This room is indeed quirky It features two double beds in a smallish space flanked on both sides by two full if quite compact private bathrooms and closets  Personally I was grateful no one had ever come around in the s to swap out the lovely s era bath fixtures or tiles  Of course quotnew construction lovingquot folks might very well wish for just the opposite What we didnt particularly care for staying in this hotel was the overall sense that our room wasnt quite completely clean  Oh the beds were made up nicely enough even if the bedspreads were dingy old and the bathrooms actually appeared quite clean indeed But the room itself had grimy windows  The window sills were a bit too dusty  The carpeting was a bit too much on the worn side  We had two windows and only one had a pull down blackout shade the other required us to draw curtains that werent especially opaque and which let the evening streetlights and morning sun in more than wed like  Also the air conditioning is a window unit that is o l d huffs out stale smelling air and doesnt cool all that well  I wondered more than once just how moldy the AC filter might be   Overall this is a hotel thats OK    and only that    for the time being but it wont be for much longer unless the management takes the necessary steps to freshen up and clean up Finally we paid  plus the reasonable parking fee for a family of three which included a continental breakfast that was sustaining enough if spartan  That would have been a bargain in a hotel more toward the Mag Mile but I didnt find the price especially great for a northside neighborhood hotel of lining standards  There is a possibility however that we perhaps paid a bit more than the normal rack rate since the Cubs were not only playing in town that night but were also    sit down please    on a winning streak of sorts     
P => What a Deal Considering the absurd prices most Chicago hotels are demanding these days this was a deal  Yes a walk down the corridors did confirm the observation that the walls are indeed thin  Yes you could hear everything going on inside each room  Luckily I scored room  that while on the street was arated from the remaining rooms by a fire door  And yes the beds are a bit tired and the rooms a bit out of date but they were clean  Neighborhood entertaining and the area felt safe  Direct buses to the Loop three blocks East  Got best rate by calling the hotel directly  In all a great value for Chicago  
P => Good place to stay We stayed here in e  for three nights We booked a kingsize room and had plenty of space in the room  The room was clean and neat the bed was in good condition airconditioning worked but the bathroom couldve been a bit cleaner  The TV didnt really work but who needs that when they are staying in Chicago There was plenty of food for breakfast and great coffee  Staff is friendly and very helpfull  Never had a problem The area where the hotel in is good and feels safe  There isnt a lot of noise at night  Lake Michigan isnt too far of a walk neither is the metrostation on Diversy  There are plenty of cafes restaurants and shops in the direct area  The hotel is one of the better ones Ive stayed in with the same rating  I would stay here again especially since its affordable compared to other hotels in Chicago  
P => Cant beat the price but    On the positive side this hotel is incredibly cheap for being in a very trendy neighborhood  The Brown line CRT train to downtown is within walking distance and the staff is friendly and attentive However be prepared for the hotel that time forgot  clanking radiator pipes furniture that appears to be rec room castaways and not the best upkeep cracked plaster and peeling wallpaper  Also rooms are tiny even by Chicago standards  Nonetheless I would stay here again  On a business trip for which I needed only a place to sleep it was a great value  
P => This place is really bad The size of the room was fine and the location in Chicago great  most everything is in walking distance  Here were the major problemsBed horribly uncomfortable and undoubtedly ades old The air conditioner barely kept the room at a tolerable temperature even on high and I slept fully unclothed on top of the sheets so as not to sweat to death The street noise was so loud  even after purchasing a pair of earplugs on night   I was awakened constantly by sirens horns and the likes No outlet in the bathroom  Only available outlet was at floor level by the bed and nowhere near a mirror  So I used a blowdryer and straightening iron crouched on the floor with no mirror to refer to  Outlets so old they didnt grip the cord  I finally had to duct tape my dryer cord into the outlet so it would function Lack of water pressure in the shower is beyond an understatement  Water came out of exactly TWO of the sixty holes in the shower head  I couldnt get the shampoo out of my hair I complained that I had a broken shower head to the front desk but they assured me that every shower in the hotel was the same way  Greaaat  So I had to spend  minutes waiting for the tub to fill with water at a trickle and I proceeded to take a hot bath on  degree days in Chicago  This really sucked To add to a horrible nights sleep there are none of those wonderful hotel quotblackoutquot drapes that every other inn on the planet has so sunlight is beaming into your room at  a m  Dont stay here unless you can function happily on oh about  to  hours sleep per night and dont feel the need for a rejuvenating shower at the end of a  degree Chicago day  I visit Chicago frequently and will never EVER stay at this dump again especially at  per night  
P => Great value funky charm Very clean spacious great location great service great value  Too bad so many dont quotgetquot the charm of an older hotel  Id much rather stay here than some generic place  Its an old building with lots of great details  The room was spacious not fancy but with character  Great original tiling and glass brick in the bathroom  High ceilings old transom over the door old fashioned radiators AC in window  Everything was very clean The Inn is only a few blocks from the Brown Line to downtown  The neighborhood is very busy and safe lots of shops and people walking around even late at night The complimentary Continental breakfast is very generous  The front desk service is excellent and extremely accomodating  When we asked for a hair dryer an iron more shampoo an extra towel    each time it arrived within  minutes  But we never asked for something in the middle of the night as Im sure the bachelorette party below did To those who object to having an quotoldquot TV or carpet    this matters how Reception was good and the carpet was clean   but Hello you should always wear slippers in a hotel And to those who complained about cracked plaster    again so what Yes if it were built in  with wallboard it wouldnt be cracked  Perhaps youd be happier at a Motel  with wallboard but no character  
P => Um I vote no I live in Chicago and stayed here for a bachelorette party  It has a fantastic location because it is by so many restaurants bars etc  One major problem is that when the reservation was made we requested a cot  It wasnt in the room so we called down to the front desk and the said that it wasnt noted on the reservation and that we couldnt have one  At that time we asked if we could get some extra pillows and blankets and we were told that if we wanted those that wed have to come down and get our own  If Im paying well over  for a hotel room for one night I better be getting that kind of thing brought to me  
P => Room and location fine My husband and I stayed here since we had an event at Wrigley Field  mile walk  The non smoking room on the first floor was satisfactory  Its in an old building in a neighborhood but the room was very clean and larger than what I had been reading about  We faced the road but were there in a weekend so perhaps thats why we didnt have noise issues  Front desk was helpful  Most were bilingual in Polish  Safe area for walking around  Parking lot fits about  cars   nightly fee imposed   whether you park there or the backup location on Clark Street at the mall  Plenty of food choices in neighborhood  Great spot if youre heading to Wrigley or want out of the traffic flow downtown  Continental breakfast served  Lobby has coffee cookies and apples  hours  Good value  
P => yuck I knew I was in trouble when I called for driving directions and the front desk had no idea what to tell me  I asked for an Exit number from the main highway and he repeatedly said he didnt know it and didnt think anyone else there did either  The room was small with chipped cheap furniture and a cable TV with poor reception  I slept with a light on and one eye open because it was just that filthy  I have seen cleaner park benches with more ammenities    
P => Good Value I spent  nights in this hotel and here are my impressionsPOSITIVES Good bargain for the location Excellent neighbood surrounding with lots of restaurants shops pubs etc  Good desk service and cleanliness Secure and safeNEGATIVES I reserved the standard room and it was TINY  Bedroom and bathroom were very cramped  OK for one person but thats about it  AC TV and lighting are very old  The TV in particular did not work very well Because its an old building it has that musty old building smell mostly in the corridors and stairwellsBasically this is a very adequate hotel if youre looking to mostly be out and about which I was  The location and price are very good  And despite the age of the place it is very well kept clean and safe  If you are not travelling alone do yourself a favor and reserve a larger room  Otherwise you and your companion will be uncomfortable  
P => Very Dissapointed The Inn At Lincoln Park ChicagoIL I was a walk in and had no problem with the price but when the clerk said there parking lot was full and I could park in a lot a block away that would have been o k  until I was informed it would cost me twelve dollars  The hotel and the room was clean and looked very nice   The bed on the other hand was TERRIBLE every time we moved there was such a loud screeching squeaking noise from the bed springs  Didnt get much sleep  There was no shampoo in the room only two bottles of hair conditioner  
P => Always enjoy this hotel This is a nice out of the way place not many rooms and each room is different some very small some with jacuzzi tubs or claw tubs etc  very old hotel  nothing fancy  its in a residentual area with a grocery store next door and Yak Zees restaurant pub across the street starbucks a drug store etc          walking distance to lake Michigan and a few miles walk to down town  
P => Great Place to stay on the Northside A group of friends and I ided to randomly visit Chicago one weekend   we reserved a two double bed room  The room was perfect in size for four people the bathroom was a great size   overall the space was just fine  The location is perfect   being originally from the area its a perfect retreat that is close to the Lincoln ParkLakeview spots  The staff was friendly the housekeeping staff was very accomodating   overall very plesant The breakfast in the morning was perfect for hungover gentlemen Great place to stay if you need a room on the northside of town   will visit again in the future 
P => Clean and convenient I just returned from Chicago and I spent  nights in this hotel  Other reviewers have commented on the size of the rooms and theyre right  The rooms are small and theres not much shelf space in the bathroom  However I found the place to be clean and comfortable and very convenient to shopping the park theaters and restaurants  I didnt spend much time in the hotel    just needed a place to sleep    but I felt very safe there and the street noise wasnt all that bad  I was on the first floor so I dont know about the elevator but everything in my room was in good repair and the housekeeping staff was very friendly and accommodating  The desk staff wasnt as friendly but I didnt have any real problems with them  The continental breakfast was pretty good and theres free coffee and tea in the lobby all day  My only complaint was that they kept the place too warm I had to run the air conditioner on high the whole time  All in all it was a good deal for the price which was about night LESS than the Days Inn across the street  
P => Not as expected I was disappointed with the hotel because the room was very small  I felt cramped  The bathroom is so small that you must close the door to use the facilities and there is no where to place bathroom items The reason that I chose the hotel is that its in an area with park etc  close by  But as it turned out he most annoying part was the noise from the street  I visited in ust and with the window air conditioner installed I could not close the window so listened to the traffic and city noise until about am  
P => Beware  Have stayed here three times in the lat year when the less expensive Days Inn lincoln park was booked  First stay was okay  Last two where horrible  The elevator is not well maintained and the rooms are worse  Burnt out lightbulbs ancient bedframes and a lamp cord that shocked me are enough to keep me away  If youre looking for a little old school Chicago flavor stay here  If youre looking for comfort walk across the street  I must say though I recently saw a remodeling permit in the window so perhaps things will improve  The only really good thing about the property is its easy in and out parking lot  But its  bucks too and youre not guaranteed a spot  Days Inn Lincoln has valets for  and the room in cheaper so stay there  That is unless youre really into hotels that remind you of those in the s   
P => Clean  My husband and I stayed here during Memorial Day Weekend and found the hotel to be quite pleasant  This hotel was great for the price and location  Its almost on the corner where Diversey N  Clark and Broadway meet  Just up the street from the El Train and bus stops are a hop skip and a jump away  The hotel staff was very nice and always helpful  Also their continental breakfast was pretty good  They served coffee juice donuts bagels my husband really liked the bagel slicer cereal and milk  Best of all they have their own parking lot with a reasonable day fee but get their early in the day cause they go fast  This fee was a lot better than paying day at one of the garages  The rooms are small and could use a little more lighting  But who wants to stay in their room all day when you have Chicago to see Also watch out for that step in front of the bathroom  
P => Comfortable and clean hotel in the near north  I have stayed at this hotel at least twice an year for the last  years last in e   Located in an old converted building the rooms are quaint and  although some of the fixtures are antique the Hotel is kept very clean by the excellent mostly Polish staff  The rooms vary greatly in size and correspondingly in price   the cheapest room normally in the   day range is very small but the price is extremely competitive for the area  The Confort Inn has a small parking area in the hotel   a rarity and you can always unload your car off the street  There are parking charges for the small parking lot in the hotel and for a commercial lot nearby with which they have an agreement  Free continemtal breakfast in the morning is excellent in clean sorroundings  The location is good   a reasonable taxi ride from downtown and within walking distance of the lake good restaurants and shops  The hotel clientele is generally high level  
P => 
P => Love this hotel This was my first time in Chicago and my friend and I were a little uncertain about this hotel before we got there  It was amazing  The staff especially LaTonya and Dan the bartender could not have been more helpful  Everything was taken care of for us and the location is perfect  The value of this hotel far exceeds the others I checked out  We were so sad to leave 
P => Far and Away the Best Customer Service EVER My family and I ided to meet in Chicago for a weekend together  My future brother in law had ided to propose to my sister at the hotel on their terrace  The concierge LaTonya and manager Alyn did EVERYTHING in their power including staying past their work hours to help us make this the most amazing proposal ever  I have NEVER experienced such help and kindness from a hotel staff in my life  Words cant even begin to express the wonderful things they did for us  In addition they helped with dinner reservations special touches tours etc  Staff is hands down the best out there The rooms are simple clean and just enough room to be comfortable  The hotel just had such a cozy family feel to it that I dont ever plan on staying anywhere else in Chicago  You wont be disappointed  Not to mention the rates are absolutely unbeatable I would recommend this place to anyone  
P => What was all the complaining about     Wow   the folks out there had me so scared about this hotel that I tried to change hotels an hour before my plane left for my business trip to Chicago What was all the huffing and puffing about Hands down this hotel is in an amazing location Staff was friendly an accomodating  I asked for a room upgrade and got the ior Suite   a cute little quotapartmentquot with a living room area plasma tv a wet bar bathroom and bedroom bed was SUPER COZY  The room was clean and any request for additional toiletries was granted with a smile The only reason I would say that the room was a  was due to the lack of complimentary internet in the room The lobby has access to free Wi Fi and is a cozy little hang out spot Im actually in the lobby area writing this review while I wait for my shuttle to the airport So   dont listen to the negative reviews  Youre in a great location fun hangout spots are at abundance and they are quick to accomodate for upgrade requests  
P => You are on your own here I stayed at this hotel from tember  to   On my last night while packing I found that my iPod was missing  I went downstairs to report this at about  pm and I was asked to fill some papers with a guy that never identified himself beyond being a security guard and no copy of the forms were offered to me  At one time this security guy told me that he needed to file a police report and even when there was a phone on the desk he went to another office and made the call so I was told  He promised to give me the number of the report but today almost  weeks after the event I still don t have it I left the next morning at  am so there was no more information about this issue the next day  I had to make no less than  calls from Mexico City in order to find out that be an answer was due for the following week  Another series of calls followed all by myself none by the hotel  Eventually they told me that the cleaning maid reported that se had never saw the iPod and that was it  The hotel I was informed had no responsability at all for the goods of their guests  So if you are planning to go there keep in mind that you are on your own  I guess that this might be the case for a   per night place in some forgotten part of the country but surely is not to be expected for a respectable business hotel in Chicago Magnificent Mile Or be it has to be with the fact that I am not American and live in mexico  Trying to follow upo a claim like this is so frustrating and time consuming that in the end nothing happens at all In short if you spend some nights there the advice is to carry with you all your valuables as they will be safer with you in the streets than in the room and the hotel takes no responsability  
P => Good value great location We stayed in this hotel for  nights  Very pleased with location and quality although we did book on a discount site and paid about   below original hotel price which is probably why we thought it was such a good deal  Coffee shop downstairs with great cappucinos excellent service at front desk one block away from Mag Mile  Walking distance to underground and to Navy Pier  Beautiful rooftop patio and despite the signs hotel staff dont mind if you buy a bevvie at the  eleven across the street and bring upstairs to the patio  Rooms are quite small as are bathrooms but clean  Cleaning staff are a bit loud in the morning and have a tendency to ignore the quotdo not disturbquot on the door and walk right in   be sure to use the chain lock Elevators are tiny and you  have to wait a few minutes to get up to your floor but really not an issue  
P => Right off the Magnificent Mile Three friends and I stayed in a double double room at this hotel for one night  You cant beat the price for this location  The rooms are small but the space is used well so I didnt feel like we were tripping over each other  Two complaints would be that the air conditioner was a bit noisy and dont even think about spending time in the room watching TV as the picture quality was terrible and there was a humming noise coming from it  On the positive side the nd floor terrace has really nice views Parking was very expensive but I guess thats to be expected if you stay downtown  We did self park instead of valet and paid  for parking from  a m  to  the next morning  When going out at night we had no trouble getting a taxi as there were plenty waiting right out front  
P => Cant beat the location As with the title you just cant beat the location and the convenience but you also get what you paid for  This is a basic services hotel and while it had been reated it is showing its age  My bathroom was reated but I dont understand how you can put the sink beside the door     I guess if the space is tight you just have to make do  The room had a musty smell but since I was only there for a day and they were sold out I stayed out for the most part  The bed was comfortable and beddings nice and clean but the fabric on the desk chair was stained as well the carpet  I used my flip flops and didnt use the chair at all  The corridors also had a somewhat musty smell that I would think a dehumidifier should be able to take care of  The lobby is spacious and since you have to pay for Internet Access in your room everyone just took advantage of the free internet in the lobby and used it from there so the lobby was rather busy with people and their laptops me included It was a toss up whether or not I would recommend this hotel but ided I could because you couldnt beat the location but know what youre getting and that this is a   star property  
P => Not as pictured We selected the Inn of Chicago based on the web site it looked contemporary and convenient  The Hotel lobby looked like one of those   makeover shows  Very cheaply done  There was an odd smell in the entire hotel and they tried to mask it with Flower freshener which made it worse  The furniture in the lobby and halls were covered with lint and stains  The rooms were small which is fine but they were FILTHY  We went straight to the lobby to get out  back and move on  After a battle with the manager he finally stated he would let us out of our reservation  Which left us on the street in uary with our luggage  Horrible experience  
P => Great location downtown by Michigan Avennue Very central location off Michigan Avenue near shopping and restaurants and  min to nearest train station  
P => Still the Most Convenient for a Place to Sleep As a tourist in Chicago one is usually too busy with the sightseeing attractions visiting the nightlife or sampling fantastic restaurants  With that sort of agenda all you need is a safe comfortable place to sleep so that you can do it again the next day  The Inn of Chicago continues to fit that bill of convenient location reasonable price and no frills necessary accommodations Located a block away from Michigan Ave  the streets around the hotel the corner of Ohio and St  Clair are quiet with relatively low foot traffic  Navy Pier is within a   minute walk and all of the Magnificent Mile is even closer  Just within blocks of the hotel are restaurants of various cuisines Italian Armenian tapas Mexican Asian casual bars and the obligatory national chain donut shops and coffee shops  A  Eleven sits on the corner across the street for any late night snack or beverage needs The Inn of Chicago does tout its Innbar a small lounge on the main level  However as the crowds or lack thereof in the bar indicated over this Labor Day weekend it is not the priy attraction of the hotel  There were at most be three or four patrons having a cocktail or beer at any given time so the poor lonely bartender  be distracted by any human contact  Therefore dont expect table service  Just go up to the bar yourself and order a drink there The fitness center was described by hotel staff as having recently been reated with new equipment  This consists of a series of new dumbbells ranging from pairs of  to  lbs  a vertical machine weight system with pull up bars and weight bench a recumbent stationary bike two treadmills an eliptical balance ball and yoga mat  A water cooler and flat panel TV are also available in the room but bring your own towels from your room  
P => excellent location comfortable bed I was sent to a conference in Chicago downtown  This hotel is just  block away  I am satisfied about the location  I was a little disappointed when I stepped in the room  The room is kinda small and the dark blue patten carpet didnt look clean  However the bed is very comfortable  After staying there for three nights I didnt feel the room was that small any more and I found they use space very efficiently   the tiny bathroom has everything  But I still feel that they need to clean the carpet and it would be much more convenient if they have free internet in each room so people wont have to go to the lobby and check their emails  
P => Excellent everything excellent except the hotel interior design bit old  but lobby design is good 
P => Great Location Great Stay I must say location location location  This hotel has one of the best locations  We were able to walk get the bus or jump on the city tour bus and get around the city without a hitch  This is not the Ritz Carlton so if that is what you are looking for don t book this hotel  Yes the bathrooms are very small but we don t base our stay or enjoyment on the size of the bathroom It was very clean updated and great water temperature  We found the bed very comfortable  We paid less than  dollars a night through easyclicktravel com so we felt it was a bargain  It afforded us the ability to get two rooms one for my husband and I and one for our teenagers  The lobby and bar were also great  I have no complaints  Yes I would recommend this hotel for a friend and we will stay again  
P => Inn of Chicago   perfect We stayed for  nights and were given a corner room  We had a great time  The room was a good size and while the bathroom was small it was not a problem for us  The Inn is within walking distance of so many attractions   its the perfect location  Usually when renting a room there is always something wrong  be the coffee maker doesnt work  be the bed is uncomfortable  be no one answers when you call the front desk  be you cant get the water in the shower to the right temp  There was absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel  It even smelled good  We will not only stay again we would recommend it to anyone going for sight seeing  Lovely place  
P => small rooms  ridiculuosly small old bathroomsslow hot elevatorshot hallwayssecurity people bothering you while your having cocktails and just lhing  
P => Hire a new staff My brothers and I traveled to Chicago for the CubsReds game this past weekend and unfortunately we stayed at the historic Inn of Chicago  We were able to overlook the small rooms closet sized bathrooms and elevators lack of room safes etc  Not a huge deal  As is often the case though PEOPLE are the true indicators of a good business and this establishment gets two thumbs down  Day  Following our arrival Friday afternoon  I realized I had left my camera in the car  Since the car was valet parked for day I kindly requested an employee retrieve my camera for me  This slight request was answered with a furrowed brow and huffy response from the door man  Frankly I was taken aback with such a response  This guy works here right Only after I repeated the request did the man get on his walkie talkie with the valet  The camera was then delivered to me  minutes later  I was slightly irritated but let it go      Day  After an exhausting day on the town my brothers and I made our way to the hotel terrace for a cigarette and to enjoy the night air  It was midnight and we soon learned that the terrace closes at  pm    for some people   Although a group of ladies and an older man were out there having a wonderful time when WE sat down at a table and chairs security appeared  The security guard walked right past the other patrons and told us the terrace was closed  Again I was shocked and irritated  I realize that my brothers are large men and for people who do not know them they  appear threatening  In reality however they are respectful and respectable men and do not deserve to be discriminated against  I was angry but again I let it go       Day  I was ready to go  Unfortunately when my vehicle was pulled around by the valet I immediately noticed that the clock face was damaged  I pointed the damage out to the valet who basically ignored me then told me to talk to the man working at the garage across the street  He was obviously no help either  I filed a vandalism claim with my insurance and am out   Would I return to this hotel No  Would I fire the staff and rehire new Absolutely  
P => Location a plus room was a bust First off I am not the type of person that generally leaves a review but this hotel definately deserved it  First off the location is amazing  As everyone has said it is a block from the magnificent mile  My husband and I drove to Chicago but had the valet staff park our car for  a day and walked or took a cab everywhere  It is a  cab ride to most every place we went and it isnt a bad walk if you want to do that instead  Now on the down side  These rooms were rediculously small  Im not saying it was a little cramped it was TERRIBLE The bathroom is the worst   there isnt a vanity and the shower is smaller than my kitchen sink  I was so disapointed  Chicago was just one of our stops on our  day road trip and with all of our luggage there wasnt any place to move throughout the room  I believe we paid  a night booked it online and this hotel was a terrible deal for the amount of space you are given  We looked at other hotels in the area and if we are to go back to Chicago on vacation we will most defnately stay at the riott on Michigan avenue  This hotel is a block from the Inn of Chicago is very ently priced and even their smallest room has to outmatch the Inn of Chicago  
P => Great Location Within walking distance of all main attractions  Try ys Cafe for breakfast not West Egg that the hotel staff recommend Staff were extremely helpful with all enquiries  Only small criticism would be the size of the bathroom  
P => amazing hotel and friendly staff ok yes i agree with everyone the bathroom was extremely small but other than that i thought everything was wonderful i love the patio on the nd floor because everyone could go there you could bring mcdonalds up there if you wanted it wasnt a pricey restruant that only a few could afford so everyone got to enjoy the beautiful view 
P => All talk no action  I was very disappointed by this hotel  In the pictures it looked cute and trendy looking but when we got there we found that all of that trendiness was all for show and that there is no comfort The room was small  the lamps made a weird noise the AC made a really loud noise and half the channels on the TV were blurry  The bathroom was TINY and the closet minuscule As for the location it was ok but I will not stay in Magnificent Mile next time Im in Chicago   too many tourists with white sneakers it reminded me of Times Square Just annoyingly touristy The price was right for the location and quotlookquot of this hotel but its basically all its got going for it  
P => Great Location Great Hotel We spent three days here for the taste of chicago we would definitely return again the room was great the bed are comfortable we was on the  floor the sky k was beautiful the lobby was spacious moderm and well appointed this location is walking distance to michigan ave where there is great shopping and resturants love this place would definitely return this is one of the most professional deskconcierge host doorman and housekeeping staffs kathleen you was the best to joe of security who was a great person and  our stay great thank you 
P => Great location big room excellent value I booked this hotel online and got an amazing deal despite it being over y th weekend  Because of that I was expecting to turn up and get some tiny box room so I was very pleasantly surprised to get a really big room   most impressive It was well furbished comfortable bed nicely orated  No complaints at all  The location of the hotel is as good as it gets half a block from the southern end of Mag Mile  Means you can walk anywhere central in the loop Grant Park Millennium Park Mag Mile River North Streeterville Gold Cost neighborhoods as well as Navy Pier  And public transport is close for the rest busses on N  Michigan and the red line El just a few blocks way  The hotel itself is a pretty cool older building the lobby is nice there is a very modern minimalist looking bar there too but I didnt go in  Also a coffee place attached  Yep the lifts can be a bit slow being an older building they are smaller  But it wasnt that bad really didnt have to wait to long ever  I guess people can be impatient on vacation There is also a roof terrace with a good view  Wireless internet is available for free in the lobby but not in rooms Any downsides The only thing I can say I thought a bit shoddy was the room servicing  Just things like towels not being replaced one day  or  days when the coffee pot was left uncleaned and coffee sachets not replaced bathroom floor not swept  Nothing major but just a bit slack  
P => Convenient The hotel is right in the middle of things so makes an excellent place to stay  We walked to Grant Park Navy Pier North Michigan avenue shops and the Gold coast  The hotel is old but clean and nice  Check in was fast and the man couldnt have been friendlier  All staff was extremely pleasant and friendly  It was an excellent buy because we got the rooms at lower than any other on or near Michigan Avenue  The best part of the hotel is the Terrace on the nd floor  It overlooks the city and is a wonderful place to sit and visit with friends read newspapers see city lights after dark whatever  Coffee shops are attached and two are right across the street  I would definitely stay again  
P => Great Location small rooms I stayed at the Inn of Chicago during the weekend of e    I booked the room the same day for  at Hotwire and it was a fine deal  The hotel is centrally located one block west of the Magnificent Mile but its not noisy at all  I arrived around am and quickly checked into my room which was very small but clean and comfortable with an excellent shower and nicely appointed bathroom  The day that I checked out I received a mistaken wake up call at am but I called the front desk and asked if I could check out a little later to catch up on the interrupted sleep and I was able to stay until pm  All in all I enjoyed staying in this hotel and I would stay again with my husband    but not with anyone else too little space 
P => Good hotel great location horrible customer service My wife and two young boys stayed at this hotel for  days and  nights in e of   As many others have stated the location of this hotel cannot be beat  Walking distance to the Magnificent Mile if you like shopping to the Navy Pier and many other attractions  Just a short train ride will get you to Wrigley Field for a Cubs game I take one or two business trips a year and usually stay at the riot or Hilton  This hotel is not up to their standards but it is not bad  The elevators are the smallest I have seen anywhere but that isnt really that big of a deal  The rooms were good size except for the bathroom  Dont even think of trying to get more than one person ready at a time in these bathrooms  They are extremely small in space and size Also the outside noises are not kept out very well at all  I was woken up many times due to noises going on outside As with most places I visit these days the customer service had much room for improvement  Have you ever gone somewhere that is supposed to serve you and when you ask them questions or ask them for help you feel like you are bothering them or taking up their precious time Well thats how we felt more than once here  I asked a lady at the front desk if it would be possible for me to print something off that I needed to print  She tried to answer my question while she was busy walking bath and forth trying to do some of her own work  She then finally told me that yes they could help me print something but their printer doesnt work most of the time  She then told me to I should go to another business to print something for    She was just rude and very unhelpful Would I recommend someone to stay at this hotel  Well yes and no  Dont even think about paying regular rates for this hotel  Find a deal on hotels com hotwire or somewhere else  Once you get the price down to half of what you pay for a top of the line hotel then stay  
P => Location was great but thats about it      The first room we got smelled like a bunch of cats had lived in it  We told the front desk and they got us in a new room right away  The first lady when we checked in was like a robot with her answers she didnt listen to what we were saying  The rest of the staff was nice  The rooms werent very nice at all  Although the beds were very comfortable The sheets were wonderful The nicest part of the hotel is the lobby we didnt spend any time in there but it looked nice and the bathrooms LOOKED nice VERY small The view was wonderful as well  We rented a movie and had to almost sit on the t v to hear it  The volume was set to a certain point but you couldnt hear it while sitting on the bed  That was disappointing  The location was nice  We got a double standard room at almost    Next time I think we will stay at the chain hotel next door for less Parking was very pricey be thats the norm in chicago that was our first trip  Took us by surprise  
P => Budget with a View Pros Location  off Michigian Ave   TrendyModern furnishings  Price given location   block max from several major bus routes feels like we spent most of our trip on   Rooftop Terrace Great view of city Llghts at night  Huge showerhead  Large flatscreen that swivels bw couch amp bed we didnt watch any TV though  Lavazza Coffee Shop attached to lobbyCons  Old Building   Tiny Elevators  WiFi isnt free in rooms you see lots of guests with their laptops in the lobby  The WiFi is provided by WayPoint so if you have an acct wthem or ATampT youll be ok otherwise factor that in   No Parking but thats the norm for the area 
P => Great Location Great Value Amazing Rooftop Terrace Available to Everyone Weather Permitting Great Hotel and great location  Main drawback is that the hotel does not have room service  We found out when we called to have a wine corkscrew brought up to our room  Instead we had to go to the lobby bar where the bartender glady opened our bottle up for us  We then took our bottle up to the rooftop terrace to enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sun set over the city  Although no room service they do have a coffeshopcafe attached to the hotel at the lobby level which came in very handy to grab a coffee and muffin on the go  Upon check in we told the staff member that it was our st anniversary and he upgraded our room for us and gave us a voucher for  free drinks at the bar That kind of treatment alone will make me go stay there again  You couldnt ask for a better location to stay at as well  The hotel is very centrally located in the Mag Mile and is a short walk to the River North area and Navy Pier  The concierge was also very informative and helpful  Lastly what I thought was very cool was that the hotel lobby had a computer kiosk where you could get your real time flight info check in and print your boarding pass from   all for free Overall a wonderul stay 
P => Nice room and staff budget price Central location This was a great room at a GREAT price   right in the center of the city  It was right on Miracle Mile close to the main deep dish pizza places and a short walk to Navy Pier  I have stayed several times in the Chicago city center and believe this hotel is a terrific value  The only drawbacks were that the bathroom was small and directly off the bedroommain room wall and no free wireless in rooms  
P => Exactly what we were looking for We went to Chicago for the weekend and wanted a place that was affordable and in a good location  We were right off Michigan Avenue for shopping and able to walk to Navy Pier for drinks at night  The hotel was great and the staff were very helpful as well  The room was spacious and this might have been the best hotel shower I have ever used  I would return to this property without question if my travels take me back to chicago  There are also a lot of good restaurant choices within walking distance both casual and nicer places  
P => Ehh mixed opinion  The room was a pretty ent size  I stayed with  kiddos  I was in a standard double room and we were not cramped The room was clean and the bedding and pillows were WONDERFUL  I have seriously NEVER had a bed so comfortable The bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen  You really do have to sit on the toilet sideways  Turn the sink on slowly so as not to be drenched Some of the staff were wonderful There was a younger probably early s black lady and a middle aged white woman probably  that were both rude and acted very put out with any request for help or directions  The other  ladies were wonderful and very helpful I purchased through lastminutetravel and got the room for  a night for  nights  I will stay again  With this hotel being in a nice area accomidations wonderful and just a few steps from Michigan Ave  It is well worth a few snotty front desk ladies and a tiny bathroom Also be aware that they charge a  per day hold to your card upon check in for a deposit I complained and they took it off through   not matter to some but a family on a tight budget  not be able to lose  of their vacation funds  
P => Great location great value Although the standard rooms were quite nice the small bathrooms were fitted with a large sink and a bulky wooden support which obstructs your seat  Youll need to sit sideways in order for things to work out  My colleagues room  reeked of cigarette smoke which was attempted to be covered by an air freshener  The emotionless elderly receptionist coldly offered another room  The signs in the hotel indicate the fitness center is on the rd floor but the rooms directory black binder indicated its on the th floor  The center consists of a couple of treadmills and  sets of small weights that I didnt see  If you want wireless internet you must spend time in the lobby or spend   per day  
P => Great Stay at the Inn of Chicago I absolutely loved this hotel  I was a bit afraid when I booked it because of the extremely low nightly rate of  which I acquired through the hotels website but it proved to be a wise isionAfter reading some reviews on TripAdvisor I thought the rooms would be incredibly small and cramped  I was actually very surprised and satisfied when I walked into my Queen Deluxe room on the th floor It was more than adequate for my budget trip to Chicago  The room was larger than I expected and even had a desk area to plan out my daily activities which was a plus  The room was spacious and I did not feel claustrophobic once over my three night stay The queen bed was comfortable and had nice clean white linens  The mattress was a bit firm for my liking but they cant please everyone when it comes to firmness or softness I had also read some reviews on TripAdvisor about the quotawkwardquot bathrooms  My bathroom was fine  It was on the small side but big enough for one to use  It had a lovely faucet sink and a typical showerbath setup  The only thing I can critique about my room was the TV  The picture was incredible fuzzy but I suppose I wasnt in Chicago to watch TV anyways  All in all the Queen Deluxe room their most basic room proved to be a comforting and welcoming space with enough room for the solo traveler or intimate couple  It has all the amenities a hotel should have and came at a price that couldnt be beat  The location was awesome too one block off the Magnificent Mile and in a central and safe area with a hr Dunkin Donuts right beside the hotel  Will I stay at this hotel again Most definitely  The friendly staff safe and welcoming rooms plus affordable prices make this hotel a no brainer Thanks Inn of Chicago for the awesome stay in your city 
P => Nice lobby tiny rooms lots of BED BUGS Bed bugs  Stay away  I am pretty forgiving when it comes to hotels  I always stay at chains with my rewards points but this was cheap looked very nice on the website and had the perfect location  Since i was staying one night i fugred what the heck take a chance  The hotel looks like the spent a lot of mone ymaking it look like a boutique in the lobby but what they do spend on lobby ore they dont spend on cleaning staff or the room upkeep  The room was tiny and the bathroom in this non smoking room reeked of smoke  All of this i could forgive becayse it was one night and i wasnt spending much time in the room  The next morning i woke up with over  bed bug bites  They found the bugs after i left and say they have corrected the problem but you dont get  bed bug bites unless its ben a problem for a very long time  It is one month later and I still have people asking me what all those red dots are on my arms  
P => Loved the Location My wife and I stay there in    and enjoyed our  night stay  The location is great   a short block from Michigan Ave  We viewed  rooms before selecting a deluxe queen room  on the th floor overlooking Ohio amp St  Clair Streets  The room was a clean x with a x bathroom  The hotel staff was extremely helpful and generally courteous  We opted for the inout privileges of valet parking for  vs  the  park it yourself and leave it option  My main room complaint was no real seating except for a desk chair  We spend time sitting reading and people watching in the lobby areas  There are multiple eating options nearby and within short walking distances  The location is one of the main strong points because almost everything downtown is minutes away on foot  I would opt to stay there again during my next Chicago visit  
P => Gets the Job Done This hotel is a no frills place to make your base on a business trip to Chicago  Clean room comfortable bed and a great shower means all the boxes are ticked  However there are no restaurant or breakfast facilities theres a small coffee shop adjacent though which serves great croissant and no room service Staff are friendly and very helpful and the hotel is conveniently placed to get around town on foot or via the quotLquot or Metra trains  
P => I adore this place This place is amazing Its wonderfully central I dont think it took longer than  minutes to walk anywhere I wanted to go  I went with a friend of mine to visit some of our Chicago friends and I have to say we booked it because it was cheap given the location   per night roughlyWe had a double double room which came with the usual TV iron ironing board hairdryer phone and a coffee maker  The beds were more comfortable than mine at home They were lovely and clean and the bathroom had a real designer feel to it  We were on the th floor and even from there the views were pretty amazingThe staff were amazing Victor who works on the transportbell boy desk was so friendly and knowledgeable  Lindsey the concierge seriously couldnt do enough for you and Simeon the receptionist recommended so many nice places to eat You could just say the word breakfast to him and hed list off half a dozen places to goIt was freezing in Chicago when we visited got down to a positively siberian   celcius but the hotel was always so warm and the fully adjustable heatingair con in the room was a god send Theres a lovely little coffee shop attatched to the hotel that serves snacks and as for the bar well lets just say between us we sampled a lot of the cocktail menu and Id recommend most of themAll in all Id recommend this hotel to everyone Great for girly weekends couples great for everyone in fact 
P => cant see what the fuss is about We stayed at the Inn of Chicago for  nights in    We found this hotel to be perfectly acceptable considering the much higher charges of other hotels in the surrounding area  We stayed in the city for just over a week where we spent the first  nights in a different hotel just around the corner as we were on business there  When we enquired as to the cost of staying in our present hotel we were quoted a price of   Considering the Inn of Chicago was approximately one third of the price there wasnt that much difference  Agreed the bathroom is quite small but who spends their holidays in the bathroom  The heating in the room is quite old but was considerably quieter than the one in our previous hotel  Overall the room was a ent sizestaff were finebed comfortable and all in a fantastic location  
P => Cant understand why everyone is slagging this hotel off   its great I have never posted a hotel review before but felt compelled to defend this one in the light of some of the terrible things people have posted about it I do note that most folk who are being negative are Americans so be you guys are just never happy with hotels unless its   and with a  a night price tagAnyway we first stayed here in ember  and loved everything about Chicago  This is in my opinion the best city on the planet so all we wanted was a good location to stay in Downtown and a nice clean hotel We loved the hotel first time due to its location the friendly staff comfy bed clean room etc etc  I couldnt really comment on the bathroom which people seem so put out about because it was just that a bathroom It was clean and it did what it said on the tin  This is really all I look for in a bathroom in a hotel where I fully intend spending every waking moment outside sightseeing and not examining the soft furnishings or sinkthe lack of restaurant is known when booking so dont really see what peoples issue is We ided to return to Chicago for our hoenymoon in ember  and reseved this hotel again with no hesitation  I booked it direct and had no issues checking in  The room was lovely again and once more we had an awesome time in Chicago  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend and I suggest the Brits on here dont get put off by some of the other reviews as youd be doing yourself out of a great place to stay  
P => Great Location Tiny Bathroom The Location of the Hotel cant be better if you want to be yards from Magnificient Mile and its Designer Shops  Check In was painless and quick  The only part I dont like is where the Hotel takes a swipe of your Credit Card for Incidentals  We went up to our room which was on the th floor which I had requested  On entering the room the one thing you notice is lack of Storage space which my wife always gets first lol  The Bathroom is tiny even smaller than rooms I have stayed in Europe and not been thought out properly but hey who stays in the Bathroom on Holiday Noise in the Hotel was minimal only the sound of sirens on the busy streets of Chicago down below  Another thing that got my goat was you had to wear wristbands on New Years Eve to get back into the Hotel which I have never had to do anywhere else apart from when doing All Inclusive strange Nearby is a good Thai restaurant although they can be a bit pushy for tips  Also there is a brill Cafe just round the corner which does ace breakfasts its called the West Egg Cafe also around the corner is Potbellys that do fantastic sandwiches The Rooms in the Hotel are a bit tired and the Carpet could do with repairing but overall not a bad Hotel  Would I stay here again probably not but for first time visitors its not a bad option because of its location Happy TravelingThe Ogre 
P => Great locationFriendly Staff I stayed at the Inn of Chicago from ember st ember th  and found my stay rather pleasant The Inn couldnt be positioned in a better location and is right off of Michigan avenue whilst also within a very short walking distance to Navy PierGrant and Milenium Park and all of the loop and downtown attractions Directly outside of the hotel there is a new tea room called The Argo and a Seven ElevenDunkin Doughnuts and a few burrito places which are open  as well as a Popeyes and a Subway so its very handy if you want to pop out for some food in the evenings after the main resturants are closed down for the night The nearest CTA line is the red line which is only a few minutes walk along E Ohio Street to the GrandState station which serves Union Station and the southern areas The hotel has a few coffeefood vendors in the lobby as well as a cool Inn Bar and lots of areas to sit and use the wireless internet and relax in the evenings which is niceI never got try the rooftop seating area as it was closed for construction during my stay but from the sounds of it im sure it would be a very nice view of the city and Michigan avenue I found my room to be basic but clean and spaciouswith a nice work area desk for my laptop which was good as my room was included with free wireless internet coupons that were given to me upon check in as well as the teacoffee facilitiesironironing boardhairdryer etc and lots of cable tv channels The bathroom was clean and spacious with a large bathshower combination as well as a large old fashioned looking sink which was a nice boutique touch to the roomalso included were the usual hotel amenities such as shower gelsoapsconditioner etc I managed to get quite a reasonable rate for this hotel and i couldnt of asked for a better location especially since i was only walking distance to the Barack Obama election rally in grant park which was incredible to attend and it served as a major hub for all of the citys attractions with the option to walk to all of the major transport links and usual Coach USAGray LineGreyhound and trolley tours of the city My final view on the Inn of Chicago is basically that if you are looking for a cleanbasicreasonably priced hotel that is in a perfect location for all of the citys attractions and has enough in room facilities to keep you ticking over on a rainy day with lots of options for eating nearby as well as being family friendly then im sure you will love staying here  
P => So so Stayed two nights for a professional conference  Check in took awhile and the receptionist was harried and kept asking people behind us in line if she could help them throughout our check in  The bathroom was tiny   hardly any space for toiletries  The towel rack was on the wall at the foot of the bathtub inside the shower curtain  The bathtub drained slowly and there was no vent fan in the bathroom  The bed was comfy enough  We had a corner room   the room itself was big but lacked ample table space which wouldve been nice with the already too small bathroom  After reading the other reviews we ided to bring a fan to help block noise at night which really helped since the ice machine was right outside our door  Our TV remote didnt work properly  I agree that the saving grace of this hotel is its great location to Michigan Ave  The room was OK but the major issue was with the bathroom   which Im sure is a result of it being a historic inn  Next time well stay elsewhere especially if were on our own tab  We ate at the West Egg Cafe around the corner which was pretty good diner type food and there is a Starbucks next door to the hotel  
P => Great location average hotel  Recently stayed at the Inn of Chicago while attending a conference and it was listed as one of the conferences  host  hotels  At the time of booking our hotel there was not a lot of choices so we picked the Inn of Chicago as the location looked great just off of Michigan Ave  Having read reviews here I was not expecting too much  Upon arrival the bell men who was standing outside just stood there and looked at me no offer to help with my bags or open the door for me to help me in  The lady at the front desk was able to check me in early  She was professional but not overly welcoming or friendly  My room  was small and had a window facing the hotel behind ours and a wall  The air conditioners are old window units that are loud and hard to regulate either too warm or too cool  The curtains hang right above the unit and partially cover the vents and allow light to come in under them  There was no closet in my room just a narrow armoire with a few hangers and also held an ironing board and iron  There was a nice sized desk but have to pay   per  hour period to use the wireless internet  free in the lobby area  The bed was comfy and the room clean  Yes the bathrooms are extremely small  I have had larger bathrooms on a cruise ship But what made it worse was the ridicules  attempt an being hip  sink which takes up what little space there is and makes setting on the toilet a tricky maneuver There is no restaurant at the hotel just a little coffer shop connected to the lobby  There is a Dunkin Donut and a Starbucks right around the corner and a   across the street  I never found a place to eat a real breakfast near the hotel until my last day West Egg Cafe a few blocks away on Fairbanks  No vending machines in the hotel and ice machines are hidden at the end of the hall the one on my floor not working  There was a concierge in the lobby during the day to suggest local restaurants and sightseeing tours  The hotel is fine if looking for a good priced hotel in a central location on a leisure trip and just using the hotel as a place to sleep  I would not recommend it for business travel  
P => idedly  eh  would stay elsewhere next time I stayed here when I attended a conference in Chicago  The location is hard to beat and thats about all I can say about this hotel  Amenities and service were almost non existent  No breakfast no restaurant even no free in room internet no fitness facility for that you need to pay day and walk three blocks to the Doubletree  I couldnt even find an ice machine I had to go to the hotel bar for ice  The bartender begrudgingly fulfilled my request for a wineglass quotOnce I give these out they never come back quot There was supposedly a part time concierge but one never seemed to be at the desk My bed was comfortable and the room clean and basic  No complaints there  The air conditioner however was horribly loud and cycled on and off every  minutes  I could not run it at night and sleep  The bathroom was ridiculously small and the sink placed so that it partially blocked the doorway  There was also mold on the wall and ceiling I didnt have any problems with the check in staff and I found the bellhops to be very helpful All in all I wouldnt stay here again  
P => Everything was great The location is great close to the central shopping district and a short walk to Old Town Near North and Millennium Park  The hotel service was friendly and helpful and check in was fine  The rooms are standard size we had a double bed room with super comfy beds  Also   they have a GREAT rooftop k with seating to take in the views of the city  This was a beautiful view especially at night Overall a great hotel for someone who is looking for an above average but not luxury hotel for a fun easy stay in Chicago  
P => VERY disappointing     I came to Chicago with one of my staff for a trade show at the Navy Pier  This hotel was listed in the hotel package had great pictures of their rooms and talked about their million dollar reation  I thought it would be a nice change to stay at a boutique hotel instead of the usual Sheraton Hyatt etc  Boy was I surprised when I arrived The location is awesome but the check in staff were terribly rude what happened to customer service training  There appeared to be a lot of people just hanging around in the lobby who were friends of the staff  I got on the elevator and felt claustrophobic and wondered if Id ever reach the th floor  When I got to my room I wondered where the million dollars had been spent be the prisms in the front windows were diamonds  The room and bathroom were the smallest Id ever seen   made European ones look huge The window air conditioner was noisy yes a window air conditioner windows hadnt been washed in a l o o o o n g time and the lock on the adjoining door didnt work properly  I immediately called downstairs after trying to find another hotel in the area that could take us and checked out  What a surprise   I was met with a very friendly voice who apologized for the inconvenience and wished me a good stay in Chicago  We left and went up the street to the  Points Sheridan on Rush Street  The staff were awesome hotel exactly what I would expect for downtown Chicago but expensive  
P => Fantastic Hotel for a Weekend Get Away My friend and I checked into the Inn of Chicago on a Friday evening for a one night stay  We loved the hotelWe checked in around  p m  The lobby is gorgeous and very chic and fun  Check in was fast and the two gentlemen who checked us in were efficient and very friendly  We had a couple good lhs with them  Im pretty sure they gave us an upgrade to a lovely corner room with an excellent view of the city  One side was a city view the other sides view was of the pool level of the hotel next door  Our room was very nice simple and stylish or and much roomier than we thought would be according to the reviews  This  have been because we had a corner room  The bed was comfortable and the bedding and pillows were soft and comfy  No complaints at all there  The bathroom was admittedly small but its not the smallest Ive been in   and it was really cute And my tall friend did not come close to having her knees hit the sink vanity from the toilet contrary to other reviews  The terrace on the nd floor is very cool it gives you a great view of Michigan Ave  Although it closes at  which I sort of understand but I really think it should be open  hours  And while it says it closes at  my friend and I were up there at about  a m  and the doors were not locked  Just FYIThe location is just excellent You really feel youre right in the heart of the action  Youre a half block from Michigan Ave  and about three or four blocks from the els red line  There are lots of great restaurants and stores very nearby  We ate breakfast at West Egg Cafe close by and it was very yummy  And Navy Pier is very much within walking distance  We sort of ran into it by accident so Im not sure how many blocks   but it didnt seem like a long walk at all  One week here might have pushed my endurance of the small bathroom but I think the location would probably help make up for it  And granted we were there to hit the city so didnt spend a great deal of time in our room  But for a weekend youd have a hard time beating the price location and quality  
P => Great location Awful front desk service We planned a Red Sox weekend in Chicago with  other couples and all  rooms were paid in full months ago  The first  couples did not have a problem checking in however when the third arrived at PM they were told that their paid in full guaranteed room had been given away and they were being sent to another hotel about  miles away  The desk help was rude unfriendly and could not have cared less that the room had been confirmed  Fortunately another guest overheard the conversation and helped them out by offering one of the  rooms that he had and wasnt using that night  That was great and the next night the hotel was able to accomodate them and find them a room  They did refund the one night but it was an aggravating experience The other staff including the bartenders and bell staff were great The rooms are rather small and the elevators are small slow and always crowded but the place is clean and the location is fantastic  
P => OK hotel We stayed at this hotel for  nights from th   My first impression of the check in staff was that they were off hand as previous reviewers have said  The room was clean and comfortable  The location is great being in the heart of the city and we were able to walk everywhere  Because of staff attitude I would hesitate to stay there again 
P => Great HotelRude front desk The hotel is very nice and is in a great location  I thought that the price was fair for what you get  The valet service and bag handlers were very good and courteous  The only problem I had with this hotel was the pompous attitude and rude behavior from the people at the front desk  They were not welcoming or friendly at all  So much to the point that I will not be staying there again  
P => Excellent Hotel My family and I stayed at the Inn of Chicago during Christmas and New Years  When we checked in we had multiple reservations but the lady at the check in was very kind and helpful and we were given the same room for our entire stay  As it was Christmas not many food places were open but the front desk had a list with phone numbers and hours of open restaurants  They were very good with giving directions  The maid was very good and always had enough towels  There is a  Eleven adjacent to the front door which is very convenient  There is also a sub shopice cream shop across from the side doors which are open  hours  There is also a Jewels about  or  blocks from the hotel ask for directions which had a very nice hot deli selection  Overall the hotel and staff was excellent and very clean  We booked our rate through hotels com but orbitz also has better deals sometimes  The prices  be high but the excellent downtown location is well worth it 
P => OK for the Location The location is wonderful  Close to shopping and restaurants just steps from the Mag Mile  The lobby was very nice and inviting with cozy modernist chairs and conversation areas  The rooms were average and the one I stayed in could use some reorating  It was very small but clean  The air conditioner was great at cooling the room and drowning out possible noise from of the neighbors  The bathroom had modern updated fixtures and a trendy vanity but the room was one of the smallest bathrooms of any hotel Ive ever stayed in  My knees hit the vanity when I used the toilet Still   if you can get a fair price the location  make up for some of the cosmetic issues  
P => Worked for this trip but    I was in Chicago for business and stayed at the Inn due to a discount offered by the seminar I was attending  The hotel is actually pretty nice with modern or in the common areas and comfortable furnishings  The desk staff was friendly and they were able to check me in to my room at  am  The concierge was also friendly and helpful when asked about getting to my seminar The room was on the small side but for a single person it was comfortable  The ac did a great job of keeping the humidity out it was warm amp rainy while I was in town and the fan was enough to drown out most of the street noise  However the walls are VERY thin I could hear entire conversations from next door and could hear the alarm clocks from across the hall This area of downtown is also pretty noisy with lots of sirens at all hours  As others have noted the bathrooms are tiny  The sink is a mod looking tablepedastel style and is too big for the bathroom  To be blunt anyone with hips wider than be quot will have a problem manuevering without banging into it  There is a shelf under the sink and a small glass shelf on the wall  I keep my toiletries in a hanging kit so the storage wasnt an issue for me but if you have a different type of kit you  have a problem finding a place to put it  The room was quite clean although I dont know why some hotels insist on using white coverlets  There were some ink stains on it but nothing nasty  The hotel has a quotreuse your towels amp linensquot program but apparently the cleaning staff has not been trained in it because I had new sheets and towels the second day even though I had not put the sign on my bed and I had hung up my towels The best aspect of this hotel would be the location   a block from Michigan Ave  with good dining amp awesome shopping  It is also a short walk from Navy Pier  
P => Was skeptical at first but it turned out OK Booking through Hotwire which I do every week sometimesyou get a surprise  It can be a good surprise in that you have a  or  star hotel for a great rate or a bad surprise in that you get a quotnot so nicequot experience  After booking this hotel I went to TripAdvisor and was a litle worried   there were good reviews and some not so good ones  But after checking in I was not disappointed especially for the price  Yes the rooms are small and the bathroom is very tiny but what do you need I found the room to be clean the bed and pillows comfortable and the desk chair didnt break my back like some do And as for location its close to everything on Michigan Avenue and in Streeterville  Many restaurants and shops well within walking distance and cabs and trains are close and plentiful There is no restaurant in the hotel  There is a bar in the lobby and a branded coffeeespresso shop off the lobby but thats not a problem with many other options near by The staff was knowledgeable and helpful but not overly enthusiastic For my purposes this was a good deal and I would stay there again  
P => Excellent for the price We stayed at Inn of Chicago and can only state very positive comments  The room was clean and comfortable and the help was very nice and accommodating  It is convenient to many sites and it is perfectly safe to walk around the area  
P => DANGEROUS THEY DAMAGED MY LAPTOP I stayed there as a European travelling to the US for attending an international meeting American Academy of Neurology On the last day of my stay I asked people at the desk to quotkeep my luggage safequot as I would take a stroll in town before going to the airport  Of course I warned the employees that my laptop was inside the backpack Leaving for OHare I took my luggage without checking how naive At the airport past the check in when I took my laptop to work   surprise Evidently they had dropped the backpack with the laptop inside as this was half open on its bottom screen out of its placeThe management simply stated that quotno one recalls any problem occurringquot and the insurance company of course refuses to pay My stay at the Inn of Chicago ended up costing me  dollars repair two half days of work lost and I dont know yet how many further problems with this laptop  
P => location is the ONLY thing going for this joke Upon arrival the receptionist woman was one of the worst service industry people that I have ever dealt with  Its not that she was rude its that she was probably one of the most unfriendly miserable people that I have talked to in a long time   robotic no personality it was shocking how cold this woman was  The rooms are average like ones that you would get at a budget hotel for  but since they are located so close to downtown they somehow get away with  rates during the week  There is no free wireless in your room they only offer it free access in the lobby I guess the highest level rooms have internet I stayed in a King Deluxe   no internet here you have to pay a ridiculous rate of  per day for it  Of course the nd floor was closed for construction so who knows about that space but chances are its just as crappy as the rest of the place  The TV program menu set up is the worst most unreliable set up I think I have ever seen anywhere  The movie menus never work and you cant turn off the volume or even lower it to a reasonable level on local channels  The quotServicequot selection on the menu brings you to a white screen with computer file names listed  The worst part is is that no one in the place seems to know how to fix the problem with their system   they all say quotweve been having problems with Comcast latelyquot  Who knows how long this quotlatelyquot is since in the entire week that I was there the movie option on the TV never worked   only local channels are available with a constant high voltage hum in the background  The room itself is not too bad and the cleaning staff does a good job  The cards for the doors constantly die or get wiped my colleague had to get a new card every night of the week   Ive never seen this problem before  The staff attributes this problem to keeping the card near your cell phone or credit card you know typical things that you have in your pocket or wallet   I guess you are supposed to carry the card around in your sock or something  The self parking situation is equally as atrocious  Now it  be a common practice but I have never seen this system before   you park you car in the garage but then you have to surrender YOUR keys to the parking garage attendant  The explanation for this is that in case of fire they would have to move your car  If there was a fire who in their right mind would attempt to drive over  vehicles out of a burning structure  Any attempts at resisting giving the attendant YOUR keys are met with them basically arguing and fighting with you about this ludicrous policy  There is no complimentary coffee   you have to buy the stuff for   cup and dont even think about continental breakfast  The bar looked nice but one can only imagine how inflated their prices would be  The chair in the corner of your room is very uncomfortable   its impossible to sit on it for any length of time  There are barely any receptacles for plugs in the rooms so plugging in your phone or laptop is challenge   unless you use the built in receptacle in the desk lamp  Trying to give out the telephone number of the place to someone from your room is not easy either since it is not written down on the phone or anywhere else for that matter  Oh and to use the gym you have to leave the building walk a block and a half and then pay  per usage  The only thing that gave me comfort about the whole experience was that I wasnt paying for the room   luckily my company did I normally dont complain about accomodations in destinations I have been to Ive been perfectly fine sleepin in hostels in large bunkrooms with  other people but this experience was certainly one to remember 
P => Average not boutique This is a solid hotel  It bills itself as boutique hotel  it is not  It is however an average hotel with a fabulous location  just one block off of Michigan Avenue  The or is nothing spectacular  The room itself was a ent size but with very few frills highly uncomfortable desk chair no easy chair  As others have noted the bathrooms are tiny  but they are serviceable and clean  The towels are a little skimpy The front desk staff were diffident and not particularly friendly  The concierge was very helpful let us print boarding passes told us the exact location of a branch of our bank etc  The doorman hooked us up with a good deal on a cab to the airport Really its the location that sells this place  Youre within easy striking distance of River North and Magnificent Mile destinations  Sites and restaurants down in the Loop are also within easy walking distance  
P => Really good location Unlike some of the other reviewers we did not get a fantastic rate we paid  per night  having said that the Hotel is in a fantastic position just around the corner from quotThe Milequotand this hotel was really clean with rooms being cleaned and towels replaced daily  We stayed for  nights from a Thursday through to the Monday and did not find the hotel unduly noisy  The Coffee shop beside reception was superb and the staff of the hotel were excellent  would I stay there again yes but would ask for a bigger room at the price we paid  
P => OK hotel near Magnificent Mile Recently stayed at the Inn of Chicago for a business meeting  The facility is listed as a boutique hotel  Check in was with a frazzled person at the front desk who was rather inefficient but friendly enough  The concierge staff and the bar staff was friendly  The hotel has no food facility of its own  It has a bar and an adjacent coffee shop  The neighborhood is rich with restaurants so the lack of that facility in house affects only room service  The room was smallish and cheap motel level  The floor of the bathroom was stained there was minimal room for stuff in the bathroom  The room did have a heaterairconditioner which worked adequately  There was a hair dryer and in room coffee maker and clothes iron  There was wireless internet in the room though with very weak signal  Outside noise began at about AM and made early AM wake up easy  The towels were adequate but of skimpy quality  All in all this facility was adequate but I doubt it would rate among the nicer rooms in Chicago  I didnt have the opportunity to compare pricing with its neighbors  It would need a significant price advantage for me to consider booking it again  
P => Party Hearty All Night Long I paid  a night which was a good deal  The location is great  a block from the Magnificent Mile  However the prior Trip Advisor reviewers were right  This is a noisy place The room was relatively clean and the staff was very accommodating  I dont mind a small room either  However I went to Chicago on business and it was like trying to work in a bar on Bourbon Street in New Orleans during di Gras  This a party hotel for quot  somethings quot Party Central  The parties spilled out into the hallways too  Different  year olds each night  I cant blame the staff  Some hotels are just party places  This might be a great pick up place for all I know  There is always lhter and partying until the wee hours of the morning  If you have kids it would work too I guess  No one would notice their crying even if they screamed at the top of their lungs    and the young adults dont make out in the hallways at least  Sadly I am a light sleeper and I needed to rest up before a work conference  I was old and tired enough to be everyones mom  It was just a mismatch So while this place is OK and the location is great just know that the rooms are tiny and the hotel is PARTY CENTRAL for quot somethings quot And after all the quotyoung unsquot need their kinds of hotels too So if you are a quot somethingquot this is a place where you might have a good time  Have funLove quotMomquot 
P => A Little Gem Another great Hotwire find  I booked this hotel for one night for  The location is perfect  The rooms are tiny but extremely comfortable  I was impressed for being a  star hotel The lobby is nicely orated My only complaint was that the windows didnt open and it went from hot to cold in minutes and I was never really comfortable when I was sleeping  
P => You get what you pay for Good weekend rate  Good location downtown  But  not  the boutique hotel it claims to be  Stayed in one of the updated rooms   paint on walls stylish sink couple of pictures exactly what you see in the room photos  However other than that it was still the same old Best Western  A bit noisy in the hallways lobby and front desk always seemed crowded  No real complaints but if youre looking for a hidden jewel this isnt the place  
P => Friendly service fun atmosphere great rate Could not ask for more from our stay  For where the hotel is located you just cannot beat the rate  The staff was incredibly accommodating and helpful  The rooms arent huge but they were clean and nicely put together  Also the bar downstairs adds to the fun atmosphere  Will definitely stay here again  
P => Great Location The best thing is the location  The hotel seems a little worn carpets could all use a good cleaning but otherwise our room was very clean  We had a plugged sink that was fixed within  minutes of me calling on a Saturday evening  Bathroom is very tiny  The few staff people we came in contact with were all very friendly  
P => Absolutely Excellent Value Just returned from a weekend at the Inn of Chicago and we were absolutely thrilled with the property and the price  We paid under  per night including tax for the Executive Queen in Room   The location is PERFECT for exploring Chicago    a half block from the Mag Mile  Rooms are NY style small but nicely orated in modernish furniture one might find at West Elm  The bathroom was quite small but spotless with plenty of towels  Nice products from Gilchrist amp Soames  Only downside was that noise from the hallway carried into the room and our next door neighbors were part of a group that liked to visit each other i e  open and close doors frequently  The hallways reflect the buildings age    theyre narrow and not fancy  Elevators are also on the small size but come frequently and are modernspotless  A group had checked in when we returned from sightseeing    we avoided the long line for the lifts and took the stairs  Although we did not use the hotel lobby bar it did attract a nice number of guests  The cleaning staff use scented products liberally    the lobby smelled of green apples and our room of reeze but as ours was a nonsmoking there was no odor of cigarettes they were trying to mask  I guess it was just their quotthing quot Didnt mind it but if you are sensitive to such products be sure to ask the cleaning staff not use them  I would not recommend this for visitors staying for a long time or for those who need lots of closet space because the smallness of the room  However for weekend visitors I would highly recommend it  
P => Nice Place to Stay My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and booked a great rate  a night through the hotels website  It was a winter weekday special but it did not include parking which was  a night at a nearby lot  The hotel also offered valet parking for a little more  Internet was free in the lobby but   for  hours of access in the room I was a little worried after reading other reviews but we had a nice stay here  The bell staff was extremely helpful with unloading our car  The room was clean  It was a little small once we brought in all our luggage but it was what I expected for a hotel room in a big city  The bathroom was clean and nice  The hotels location was nice  We didnt do too much around the hotel because it seemed like it was mostly chain stores and restaurants  Instead we walked about four blocks to get on the train and explored other areas of Chicago  I would stay here again especially at this price  Even with the added costs of parking and in room internet access it still seemed like a good deal  
P => Pleasantly surprised Stayed with  friends over Thanksgiving and was a little worried after reading some reviews on TA about the quality of the hotel and about them honouring reservations for rooms with  double beds through external websites which we had  However there was no problem with this upon arrival  Lobby is nice looks recently reorated and the lady at the check in desk was friendly enough  The concierge was also helpful with good recommendations for restaurants and clubs  Room was basic clean and comfortable with the  double beds and the bathroom was of a good size   complimentary toiletries also included  Room was cleaned daily to a good standard  We had probs with our hot water and heating which we complained about and maintenance came straight away to fix  Hallways and lifts are run down but this didnt bother us lifts are quite small though  Bar wasnt much but drinks were generous and the barman also recommended some places for us to try  Best thing about the hotel was the location literally round the corner from the Magnificent Mile which was fab for us as we were there to shop And sightsee  Was also near to Navy Pier  Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel based on our experience was so cheap for a really central hotel  If you want luxury then this isnt the place for you but otherwise its great  
P => Better than expected  News Flash  This is not a five star hotel nor does it pretend to be  With that out of the way I will now write my review   I have stayed at this property for years since back in the days it was a Best Western  It has always been a no frills hotel offering great rates for a location one block from Michigan Avenue  It now advertises itsefl as a boutique hotelquot which I think is a bit of a stretch but there have been improvemnents since the Best Western Days   We booked a standard room with a king size bed for  a night  The room was recently reated with a brand new bed furnishings and or  The bed was very comfortable and the room very soundproof  Yes the bathroom was small but it served the purpose   As for the help the front desk concierge and housekeeping were all very helpful and friendly  One evening I aked the concierge about reservations at the Grand Lux  She told me they do not take reservations but gave me her business card  She said present the card to the hostess at the Grand Lux and I would receive preferred seating  We went over for dinner and upon presenting the card we were seated within  minutes for what appeared to be an hour wait for everyone else   In conclusion there are better hotels in the area if you are willing to pay the price  There is no indoor pool here nor restaurant but you get a nice room and great location in downtown Chicago for around a  a night  That is enough for us  
P => No need to read any more reviews My boyfriend and I stayed at the Inn of Chicago for  night based on getting a deal on online  That said Im glad I didnt pay more than I did for the room  The location is GREAT  Whether youre a tourist or a native like us who just needs a room for the night its a great spot right in the middle of everything  The lobby is small but everything was orated very nicely and check in was quick and painless  The front desk attendant was courteous and the bellman wasnt too pushy  The elevators are rather slow but keep in mind this is an old building  Our queen room was clean with minimal but tastful orations  The bed was very comfortable just enough pillows and blankets the tv worked the heat worked the carpet was clean as was the bathroom  My only issue is with the sink in the bathroom  The design is such that it juts out taking up  the doorway  You  bump your hip on it  Also there isnt a lot of counter space so if you have a lot of toiletries you will have no place to put them  In my opinion that is a really small gripe  This hotel is definitely a no frills kind of place but its clean affordable cute and I had a great nights sleep at a place that is right in the heart of the city  I didnt hear any noise from the outside and I was on floor   Its a great place to sleep for a night or two but not a great hotel if youre looking for onsite amenities andor a posh room  
P => Great Location Stayed the weekend at the Inn  I read alot about the unfriendly staff and the long waits for a room  I sent my wife in while I waited at the unloading zone she was out in about three minutes with no trouble at all  The room was small but very clean  The beds were be the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever been on  Very close to everything  block to Michigan Ave  The bathrooms were small had a hard time getting hot water and very little pressure but was fine  Parking  block away no in and out and  a day  Overall very good for the money will definately book again for my next Chicago trip  
P => Excellent Location    North Michigan Ave This hotel is in a great location  seconds to N  Michigan Ave  seconds to Nordstroms  Great cafes and restaurants within one or two blocks  Lake Michigan and Navy Pier about five blocks east  The hotel itself  Ok so it was built in the s  The bedrooms are small and so are the bathrooms  For anyone who has stayed in a hotel in Europe this will be very familiar  Just how big of a bathroom does anyone need More room would have been nice but not necessary  Some rooms are bigger than others  I think we were a little fortunate to get a corner king room that had windows on two sides and great views and was a little bigger and more comfortable  So if more room is what you need ask for room  or other corner rooms Condition of the room  Average to above average but not outstanding  Certainly clean but a little worn  Nothing that a little money wont cure Front desk  Below standard  Friendly but not knowledgeable about their own hotels policies and practices  Three different people gave me three different stores on the parking fees  One said that the self park was part of the room rate which I found out was wrong  The bellhops and valets were very helpful and knowledgeable  The front desk staff definately needs training Id guess your opinion of the hotel would also vary depending on the prices paid for the room  In just looking at ember  the prices for a deluxe gueen room will vary from  a night to   At  it is an absolute and amazing bargain  At  a night you are still doing very well  At  its well over priced for what you get  They are pricing for the ket they are in  If you are flexible on your dates you can get a velous bargain  If you get stuck with a  price you will feel cheated for the value received  My definition of a boutique hotel is one that is special and almost perfect  This one is very good but no gold ring  However its certainly satisfactory  The room air conditioning was not all that noisy certainly not more noise than the average hotel room  But it can use some minor freshening up and front desk staff training  The concierge could be more friendly  The point is go enjoy Chicago  You will be in a wonderful and fun filled area  Use every minute  
P => Location Saves It Booked for a trade show  Accessible room requested because of hip surgery   fortunately not total necessity because    room was TINY as was bathroom but had raised toilet amp grab bars important and roll in shower not necessary  One person in a wheelchair would fill the room  Anyway Im mobile so my husband amp I had this queen bedded tiny room  He woke me about  a m  the first night and said there was water in the bathroom  Turned on light and the ceiling was bulging and water dripping onto toilet  Called front desk response was fairly speedy except noone seemed to know what they were doing  Manager radiod to front desk to get us another room  Luckily there was one down the hall and the bellman moved our hanging clothes on the hangers and I just stuffed everything in suitcase and manager amp bellman took them down the hall   to a considerably bigger room with a toilet that seemed made for midgets  Well I managed somehow   the effort was worth it for a bigger room  We were there  nights  Temperature was hard to adjust with somewhat noisy air handler Dunkin Donuts across the street is handy   block from Michigan Ave  and good food all around  Also convenient to buses We recommend Boston Blackies at St Clair amp Grand also Pompeii family italian in  block of E  Ohio for good reasonably priced meals  On the upscale we really enjoyed Grand Lux Cafe at Michigan amp Ontario   its a Cheesecake Factory spin off  And Lawrys Prime Rib one block further west on Ontario   fantastic We paid   taxes   no bargain  But I love the location  The Red Roof Inn is very nearby  be that would be betterAnd when did it become Inn of Chicago Magnificent Mile It was Best Western Inn of Chicago a week ago   
P => Get a Deal I got a deal on a large room at the Inn of Chicago and thank god for that  If I had paid full fare for this room I would have been very disappointed  The good the location and the lobby or  The bad the front desk clerk the tiny dark hallways tiny slow elevators the wires and cords running everywhere in the rooms the tiniest bathrooms and the almost working TV remote   Ive stayed in quite a few hotels in the Magnficent MileStreeterville area of Chicago and this is one that I dont plan on returning  There are too many wonderful hotels in Chicago to waste my time at this one  
P => Total Dump with Good Location Save yourself some misery and do not stay here  The rooms are small and run down with a noisy wall unit that barely provides airheat  The wall unit is not the only thing that is noisy in this hotel  The walls are paper thin so people in the hall sound as if they are in the room with you  The bathroom is the size of a postage stamp  Once you enter the bathroom you cannot move at all and can barely turn around  Overall the room seemed unclean and was uninviting  Dont be fooled from the website as I was  Although it looks nice from the website the only thing remotely nice about this place is the lobby  Also dont ask the frontdesk staff for anything  They dont seem to care and were very rude  They only competent staff they seemed to have were the concierge and cleaning ladies This place gives Chicago a bad name  Do yourself a favor and save money somewhere else PositivesClose to the Magnificent Mile  
P => A Bad Day I stayed at the Inn of Chicago for one night with my brother and his wife who were visiting us The location was convenient the price not terrible for the time of year although have done better in the past Upon arriving to check in at pm we were told our rooms werent available yet so we went off and did some looking aroundshopping for a few hours and came back to be told that the computer system and phones were down along with one of the elevators and that they couldnt assign rooms After sitting around for a bit it became apparent that there would be no speedy resolution so we went off for a walk and to have dinner When we got back at pm we were finally able to get our rooms not enormous but big enough for a short stay Im not sure what my brothers was like but the bathroom in mine was so small that the washbasin and the wooden table it was sitting on blocked legroom on one side of the toilet   forcing angled sitting  The metal holders for the glass shelf holding soapsshampooscups were very loose in the damaged wall and the shelf angled downwards somewhat precariously The toilet itself contained unflushed toilet paper nothing solid fortunately  The lower bedsheet was stained blood on one side which was the most disturbing thing The airconditioner was uneccesarily loud during the night Yes much of this probably resulted from the breakdown of the computer system and communications between the front desk and the cleaning staff nevertheless I will not be bothering to return to see what the place is like on a good day  
P => A great location The best about this hotel is the location Its conveniently located half block from Michigan Ave and right in the middle of everything The hotel self is not on the top of the line even though it have had major reations some areas still can use some additional work But for the price we paid and compare it with other hotels in the same area its a bargain  
P => Great Location Small Rooms We just spent Labor Day weekend in Chicago where we stayed at the Inn of Chicago  The lobby has been recently redone in a modern neutral chic atmosphere that is in the running with current hotels  However it did not quite compensate for the small room and ever tinier bathroom where we stayed  We werent expecting to stay in a suite but this was definitely too close for comfort  My husband didnt mind the small room once we quickly discovered free porn on the tv  Now I dont know if this quotamenityquot is offered to all guests at the hotel but we were certainly surprised  A word of caution If you are traveling with children I would be worried about letting them flip channels on the remote because you dont know what will appear on screen  Otherwise the hotel is  block from Michigan Avenue and centrally located to most city sites  While in Chicago we took an architecutral tour that started from Navy Pier  We also took in a baseball game at Wrigley Field and ate Chicago hotdogs at Wrigleyville down the street from the stadium  
P => Nice holiday at the Inn We spent two nights at the Inn and were very happy with our choice  The Inn is very well located right downtown The room and bathroom were small but very clean and useful  The bathroom was partially reated but everything worked fine  The staff was helpful and very courteous  The lobby is funky and gives out a good vibe  Of course being downtown Chicago makes it noisy sirens and construction around the hotel so dont expect to sleep till noon  But who would want to in such a great city Dont hesitate to book a room because for the price you wont be disappointed 
P => Dissatisfied When I travel I only need three things a comfortable bed and and pillows relative quiet and ent service  The only thing I got was a comfortable bed  The walls here are paper thin  Fortunately I wasnt roomed next to people with young kids or a loud group but I was next to the ice machine and I could hear it perfectly and I could hear the elevator ding down the hall  I wasnt woken up by any noise but I sleep heavily and I think it is just fortune that I wasnt sharing a wall with rowdier neighbors  The service was sub par  They only have one woman working concierge the whole day and when she takes a lunch break if she gets one at all they dont have anyone to cover for her  People were lined up to talk to her and she often gave me incomplete information didnt tell me that the purple line train stopped running during certain parts of the day so I was stranded and other such incidents  Its not her fault its just that there is constantly a crowd of people around her asking questions  Also I had my watch stolen from my room  While this could happen at any hotel I was insulted when security suggested to me that I must have quotmisplaced it quot I was traveling by myself so there was no one else in he room with me and I was backpacking so I didnt have very much stuff  I spent two hours on my last morning there when I could be sightseeing turning my room upside down and searching through everything before I made the report and the guy had the nerve to suggest that it was my fault NO You have a thief working for you  Finally I had a room with a walk in shower no tub and the water pressure was pathetic  I dont need to waste tons of water and have it come at me like a fire hose but this was difficult to wash my hair in  Also the shower dripped after I turned it off so I called maintenance to let them know  A guy came and looked at it and after he left it was still dripping  I was going to call and let them know but at this point I realized that the people at this hotel dont have their crap together so I let it go   instead I got earplugs  Overall the bed was comfortable and I was able to sleep  But I would look elsewhere if I were to return to Chicago Also I think there are sister hotels to this one in Chicago that are under the same management  I would avoid those as well  
P => O K  stay We checked in late and they had overbooked so they sent us to the Allerton for  nights  We came back to the hotel for our last night in Chicago and the room was adequate  It was quiet spacious and the bed was comfortable  My complaint with the room is that tiles were falling off the wall in the shower and the bathroom was a bit dark  We found most of the front desk staff to be friendly and accomodating  Parking in a nearby gargage with validation from the hotel was a great deal  The location is very good  I might give them a try again in the future  
P => great location great little hotel on excellent location not the most luxurious of hotels but superb location  the room was very small but clean and comfortable the bathroom was the tiniest one i have ever seen you can literally sit on the toilet and touch both walls if the bathroom were a little bigger i would definately rate this hotel as above average  the staff were all pleasant the prices in the hotel bar were very expensive   two beers  i would stay here again but only if it were two people per room as any more would not fit  
P => This is a solid   star hotel  I ve read most of the reviews about the Inn of ChicagoBest Western and I think a lot of them have lost perspective  The bottom line is that this hotel is a great choice if you don t want to spend a lot of money  In fact between valet parking and the room itself I paid about  for this place which is rekable given its location  If I would ve spent   more I would ve chosen another hotel  There certainly are cons about this hotel Tiny bathrooms rooms elevators The bathroom might be the smallest I ve ever seen  The room itself was small as well but I ve seen smaller rooms in Chicago e g  Days Inn Lincoln Park and world wide  The elevator was small and could barely fit  people especially if one had suitcases but you make do   Cheapness factor This isn t the Swissotel or the Hyatt  The hangers are the kind that you can t move from the bar  They have plastic cups instead of glass  The towels aren t wildly absorbent  The remote control for the TV was beat up and obviously hadn t been replaced when the place was reated recently  Noise We had a room facing the Ohio Street side  They had a construction site across the street  The noise from that wasn t too bad for the night we stayed but the traffic noise easily seeped into the room sirens horns etc   This is different than my experience in other more modern hotels in downtown Chicago which seal out noise better e g Intercontinental Swissotel etc   Also the hall noise was a bit of a problem at times I can tell that the doors don t do a great job of sealing out noise even though a lot of people are just plan rude and talk too loud  Pros Cleanliness Since I stayed only one night and quite literally spent about  of the  hours in the room sleeping my biggest priority in a room is cleanliness  For a   star hotel the   star rating on Hotwire is a bit off this place was very clean  I think it was newly remodeled and the rooms had blankets with duvets and also clean bathrooms  Again for the price I paid this place had the cleanliness of a   star hotel  This included the uniquely orated lobby  Customer Service They seemed understaffed at times but rush periods happen  What s important is that they keep their cool and remain friendly  All staff at this hotel were friendly   Location  blocks from CTA red line and a block from the Magnificent Mile this hotel is centrally located  And again for the price I paid under  for the hotel stay this is quite rekable   Bottom line This is an old hotel that s been recently remodeled  The hotel is a great   star hotel so remember this level of service when you are paying and you ll be very happy with the results  
P => Best Western not at all We stayed in the Best Western Inns amp Suites in Downtown Chicgo for  nights in   Its location is very central just off the Magnificant Mile but the hotel was a big disappointment  From the front all looked okay the reception area was fine too but as we got out of the lift on the rd floor we thought we had the wrong hotel  There were pieces of food stuck in the carpet in the corridor which remained there for the duration of our stay  Our room was tiny with  queen beds which took up all the floor space we had asked for  queen bed  There was no wardrobe just a very frail rail with hangers the coffee maker had baked on coffee which had been there for some time there was one electrical extension lead with  plugs hanging from it and wires trailing all over the place  The window was so small they shouldnt have bothered but it did allow the noise from the construction site across the street to fill the room at am each day  We had no do not disturb sign even though we asked each day for it so we were woken each morning at   by housekeeping  We had done a lot of travelling before we got to Chicago and were hoping to relax before we went home  The rate we were charged was  for  nights and was very bad value we had stayed in motels far superior and much less expensive than this  The only  things going for this hotel is its locationand the close public transport which is excellent in Chicago  We asked to be moved soon after we checked in and were told theyd do their best but we heard no more  The receptionist said they were reating the premises but there was no evidence of this the hotel is dirty and carelessly run  
P => Great hotel and location We stayed there for  days for a business trip The hotel was   redone and beautiful The front desk receptionist who received us the first day was not nice at all They gave us a nice and big room the room was clean the bathroom was small but okay Great services they accepted packages for us concierge is AGreat experience we will go again  
P => Great Location and Value Small Rooms All reations are complete and the lobby is quite nice  However the first clerk to help us check in was very rude  Luckily her coworker took over and got us into our room very quickly  Elevators are tiny and slow  Room also small  We had a room with double beds the beds almost took up the entire room  Bathroom is also tiny the newly reated sinks took up too much space  However the location and price were unbeatable  The beds were also very comfy  If you dont plan to be in the room very much this is worth it  Navy Pier is only about  blocks down the street and there are plenty of places to grab all meals in walking distance  Michigan Ave  is a half block away  Millienium Park is just down Michigan Ave  I would stay again just bc of the location  
P => Okay for the price The comfortable bed and hot shower were the highlights of our room which was extremely small  The front desk staff are like robots  When checking in there was a line so I was able to observe the bored canned responses that they continued to give with no sincerity  Whatever youre not coming to Chicago to spend time at the front desk  The hotel was clean and quiet and the bartenders in the lounge were very nice  There is a convenient store across the street and you can get your morning coffee at the  hour Dunkin Doughnuts also across the street  Overall not bad but nothing great  
P => would stay again There must have been a drastic change in this hotel since some of the reviewers stayed here  We were very skeptical to keep our reservations but were glad we did  The room was completely remodeled and adequate for our stay  the staff was very accomodating and friendly  There was everything you could want within walking distance to this hotel Coffee next door icecream across the street a little superette kitty corner michigan avenue a half block away and of course loads of restaurants nearby  All the recommondations from the concierge turned out well and the bell hop promptly called us a cab for our trip back to the airport  Try it youll like it      
P => Questionable The only real reason to book this hotel is cost and location  It has little going for it in terms of service quality or the attractiveness of the rooms  It is very poorly managed and maintained  There is no restaurant onsite but many inexpensive and more expensive options within a short walk Upon arriving at this hotel at  p m  we were advised that check in is at  p m  We returned at that time and were advised there was no room available  This same problem affected a number of other people in our group some of whom were not offered rooms until  p m  or later  Absurd excuses were offered for this such as that they should have arrived at  p m  The first room we were offered was totally smokey although this is billed as a smoke free hotel  We returned to the front desk  The second room we were offered was laid out as follows There was a queen bed with a television stand at the base against the wall with doors on the front  Inside these doors were the only drawers in the room this was the bureau  However the television stand was so close to the bed that the doors could not be opened  Thus no functioning bureau  One can only imagine who laid this out  When opening the door to the small bathroom there was a new sink that had been put in with a wooden frame  The frame of the sink extended across the doorway approximately  the distance and against the toiled on the other side  How this passes fire codes one can only guess  There was no closet in the room just hangers in the room similar to a Motel   Bottom line absurd layout and various unacceptable arrangements  We had booked for about  per night plus tax for four nights  We jumped on      and selected an anonymous four star hotel in the neighborhood at  per night  Once we had bid we were advised this was the W on the lakefront three blocks away  We returned to the front desk of the Best Western advised that the second room was not acceptable either were told we could leave at no charge and departed for the W Incidentally the W is more like a five star hotel and the regular rates were in the neighborhood of  per night  Meanwhile the Best Western billed us one night despite their promise and a personal visit to the hotel for a refund netted a nice conversation and no action  Still we saved money Bottom line check Hotwire for options in the Streeterville area which is where this is or Miracle Mile area  Avoid this Best Western if you possibly can but if it is the cheapest you can find in the area go with eyes wide open  It is   stars at best  Perhaps   
P => Rather sleep in my car I paid  a night more then what i paid at the wyndham i woulda been there agian but they were booked and the room i have is utterly horrible First off i walk in and its small as heck  It smells weird and theres NO OPEN ELECTRICAL OUTLETS I open the door the the smallest bathroom iv ever seen  The sink has no vanity so theres nowhere to put my bathroom stuff the shower rack is rusted and i have no towels Im not even hanging my clothes up here because their quotreationquot consists of poorly painting over rusted closets and ect  the AC is ALWAYS on and i cant shut it off because they took out the controls and the room has NO controls for the rooms temp at all  No room service no barloungerestaurant and their valet parking is a joke  You need to pay them  a DAY in cash you cant move your car and if your keeping your car at your hotel your entire stay like i am im on a staff  that is lasting for weeks so i just walk to work you have to pay the entire fee for your car in advance Dont get me started on the bed     im not sure these sheets have actually been washed      I would rather sleep in my car then stay in this      ever again  What sucks is this is DAY ONE out of   Jesus     more days    
P => Worst Experience Ever First they lost our reservation for  rooms  nights each with  beds and had  room for  nights with a queen bed  Second they were very rude and the room was INCREDIBLY small  We were only alloted one wash cloth for  guests in one room  Another room was only given  towels for  guests  In short I was extremely displeased with the service and facilities  
P => Great location We stayed at this hotel for  nights in total  The hotel is in a great location with the magnificent mile less than  minutes awayThere is builiding work being done on the hotel but it didnt bother us the bar and breakfast area were closed because of this but West Egg a few blocks away was fantastic for breakfast  We ate there every morning of our stay   hour store across the road from the hotel does rather nice snacks such as sandwiches and pizza and of course sells alcohol The room was of a ent size and was clean  The bathroom was small but again clean  I would stay here again as the location is fantastic  We had no bother in Chicago we felt very safe  
P => Great Location Great for budget The location of this hotel is EXCELLENT  Its a block off the Magnificent Mile easy walk to Navy Pier the river and even Millenium Park  We stayed here for two nights in ust  Its nothing overly fancy so if you expect luxury do not stay here  But the room was of ent size and clean  The bathroom was small but I was prepared for that from reading other reviews  The lobby looks outdated but that didnt bug me as long as my room was clean which it was  They have a terrace on the top floor which a lot of people are not aware of  Pretty good views from way up high  There is a great burrito place right across the street  We had lunch there on both days  Theres also a Dunkin DoughnutsBaskin Robbins across the street  There is no restaurant in the hotel  We walked to McDonalds for breakfast one day    about   blocks away  We booked the room on hotrooms com and save a lot of money  Rather than paying over night we paid  per night  For that price and that location this place cant be beat  Felt safe too which was very important for two women in the city 
P => Central and OK If you are looking at something reasonably priced and fairly central then this is for you  It is clean and basic although they really should do something about those pillows   boy are they awful The conceirge and bell staff are extremely freindly and helpful so you cant go too far wrong Try the West Egg on E Ontario St for breakfast   great service and choice  The fresh fruit salad is huge we shared one portion between  people and stuggled to finish it  You have to get there early or youll have to wait   but the turn round time for diners was swift and efficient   very impressed  
P => Great Location  Good Value This hotel is in a perfect location  You can walk just about anywhere you would like to go  It is blocks away from the Hancock Center Wrigley Building etc  and right in the middle of the Magnificent MileThe rooms are small but clean  This is certainly not luxury but it is in the perfect location and fine for the money you pay Dont expect luxury and you will be fine  I stayed here  nights while on business and would stay again if cost prohibited other properties  There isnt a restaurant on site but there is a Dunkin Donuts and a Burrito place across the street  Also try ys Cafe for breakfast It is about  blocks away  
P => Good value for money This Hotel is good value for the money  It is centrally located just off Michigan Ave  There are a lot of homeless people about the hotel but this seemed to be typical for Chicago there were a lot of homeless about the city but none of them too intrusive The bed was big and comfy and the rooms were very spacious cleaned daily  bathroom could do with a facelift but it was clean  Could hear a lot of noise from one of the neighbouring rooms but not sure if they were just very loud  Check out all the brochures of things to do in Chicago in the lobby  
P => Just fine for cheaper accomodations in the area I basically just needed a place to crash in Chicago for a Saturday night  I wanted something in a convenient and safe location but I didnt need  or want to pay for  anything fancy  This hotel fit the bill for my criteria  While the room was small simply appointed and a bit in need of some reoration it was relatively cheap for my last minute booking and considering it was right in the heart of the magnificent mile area you just couldnt beat the location I have two gripes first the heatingcooling system in the room was a bit extreme  I found it hard to regulate the temp to a happy medium and ended up settling for a very intensely air conditioned night thank goodness they provided an extra blanket  Also I was disappointed with the internet access in the room  I got the impression upon booking and checking in that all rooms were equipped with high speed access however much to my dis there was only a dial up connection through the telephone and I couldnt even get it to work  This day in age any hotel in the middle of a big city should have its act together   it is not that difficult to set up Overall though I was satisfied with a clean and comfortable enough hotel right in the middle of everything and easy to find for an out of towner  
P => Not worth the money This room was a dump for  a night This room is all LOCATION  It has a great location  It is right near the free trolly and within a short walk of red line  It is one block away from Magnificant Mile  So if you want a  basic room but with a great location this was OK  I have stayed all over the world and just expected more for four stars and that much money  
P => Relief Stayed at the Inn of Chicago with a group  of girlfriends for  nights  Was relieved that most of the stuff that was written here by other reviewers didnt come true for us as I was very nervous about it Only real headache was checking in  We had made our arrangements as a group but the information didnt seem to make it to the front desk for some bizarre reason even after I had confirmed all the reservations twice the week before There were several issues that were putting my blood pressure up including the young man that was quothelpingquot us  We finally got it sorted out but some of the desk crew seriously needs some training in customer service skills and I told them that Rooms were nice and clean  My roomie and I were on the th floor  Only problem we had was the ventilation in the bathroom  It got pretty steamy in there after a shower Otherwise everything else was fine  We also got to hang out on the roof top terrace  Not much of a view as the hotel is not that tall but it was our favourite hang out location as our weather was greatWe used one of the meeting rooms for a get together and had the most wonderful wait staff assigned to us Thank you Beto He was terrific  Also was impressed with the evening manager and desk staff  Two thumbs up to Don and EllisAlso used the concierge service and had great experiences each time we did  Shae was lovely and very helpful turning us on to where to get show tickets at half price pointing us in the direction of breakfast locations and making reservations for dinner for our group  Thanks ShaeThe location is ideal close to everything Volare restaurant is a must if you like pasta  West Egg Cafe for breakfast expect a wait  Dunkin Donuts across the street was invaluable And wine is available on the opposite corner to the hotel  Walgreens a block away also a movie theatre subway access  Eight blocks west was Carsons for steak and ribs    awesome    John and Nestor took good care of us there Ed Debevics across the street from Carsons if youre into abuse and diner food Seriously their schtcik is to harrass you  Frenchie our waitress looked after us Michigan Avenue is steps away  Borders the Virgin Record Store and the Hershey store were my home away from home I also strongly recommend the double ker bus tour  A great way to spend the afternoon  The tour takes about two hours unless you jump on and off to explore along the way  Takes you all over the downtownNavy Pier was a great place to hang out Sea Dog tours will take you for a  minute boat ride to view the city from the lake  Lots of great shops mini golf ferris wheel and stained glass museum plus lots of other things to do thereAlso had time to visit the King Tut exhibit at the Field Museum and Robie House Im a Frank Lloyd Wright fan and was not disappointed  Simply awesomeAfter this visit Chicago has become one of my favourite cities and I will go back and probably stay at the Inn of Chicago again  Except for the check in hiccups we had a great stay  Kudos to the city of Chicago for keeping your city beautiful and user friendly  Also the people were so nice and accommodating    everyone we asked for help went out of their way to assist us We had a great time Thanks Chicago 
P => happy and pleased Stayed here from   to   and was pleasantly surprised at what we got for how little we paid  Clean room helpful and friendly staff on every level quiet location  Had a problem with my computer and wifi but got quick and efficient help from the service guy and the front desk  Really nice people working here  On one afternoon when the computers at the front desk were not working right the bellmen passed out cold water and bottled beers to the people in line  Right across the street are places to get a quick meal ice cream doughnuts snacks  If you want to have a special dinner you dont have to walk far at all  With a restaurant guide and a map you can find almost anything you want  There are even three well stocked superkets close by  We even walked to Millineum Park and the Art Institute from this hotel  We would go back here in a minute People who work for Amtrak stay here so you know it cant be bad  If you want a place you can walk to everything from this is it  Take the elevator to the nd floor to go out on the terrace a great vista any time of the day  The neighborhood is beautiful too  Hot water and good elevators no complaints there  
P => Average stay in a great location I spent the first three nights of a touring holiday in this hotel  Due to problems with flights there were terrific electric storms on the East Coast massively delaying everything I checked in at   a m  rather than the anticipated   p m  after having phoned to warn them that I would be late and unsurprisingly there were no delays  I found out later that they did fail to give me two messages one of whoch was rather crucial The room was unrekable but clean and adequate  There wasnt much of a view except of a fire escape but its an old City hotel rather than a Resort hotel so that didnt bother me  The aircon worked but was NOISY Its a shame that the bar is closed but theres an all hours store on the corner opposite and there was a can machine next to the ice machine on my floor  As a base for sight seeing the location was great   Just a shame I underestimated the heat and humidity when setting off on foot   I was glad that my shower worked well when I returned after a day outId seen that they have a roof terrace on their website and was suprised that there were no signs to it  However I hopefully took the lift to the top floor and easily found it  Now thats where the views are to be found I had a very pleasant quotsundownerquot there on my second night bought from the store  There appears to be a closed bar up there which is a terrible missed opportunity  
P => Great Location Great location  Very clean  Friendly Staff  
P => Great Location The best thing about the Inn of Chicago is the location  You are literally blocks from Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier  The concierge was very helpful when we asked about taking the train to see a White Sox game  Make sure you get an all day train pass otherwise its  every ride  they are also good for bus rides  We were able to check in pretty early  am which was not a problem for the front desk and when I asked if we could have a corner room they were able to provide one  The corner rooms seem bigger to me be theyre not but you get windows on both sides of the room  The only negatives I would have areThe windows were filthy but its not really the hotels fault  There is construction going on across the street The elevators are TINY  With three of us and a suitcase there was no room left in the elevator  The beds are only moderately comfortable but the room was clean as far as I could tell and the location was great  Parking is around the corner  for  hours  I would stay there again for a weekend trip One last thing there is an AWESOME breakfast place just down the street I think its near St  Clair and Ontario called West End Cafe  Theres always a line but it goes very quick  They have fabulous omelettes  Make sure you try them 
P => Hotel okay for the price    We stayed two nights at this hotel  For the price we received under  per night so close to the Mile and food you cant complain  Rooms are small with a tiny bath but we found it clean and rarely spent any time in our room  Elevators and the lack of ability to print our boarding passes for us would be the only negative  We would stay there again for the right price      
P => What do you want for the money We normally stay at the Hilton standard of hotels in the US but these were very expensive on and around the Mag Mile in Chicago so we stayed at the BWIOC for four nights from    We weren t expecting any kind of view but they put us on the th floor on the E Ohio St side  Just other buildings to see but I suppose it beats the fire escape view that another reviewer had  As it s only one block east it  as well have been on Michigan Ave itself  There are two convenience stores diagonally opposite and a Dunkin Donuts to the side for breakfast  Two blocks towards the lake we ate at a lovely Spanish style tapas restaurant but can t remember the name  Best lamb I ve ever had  The young lady at the concierge desk was very helpful  The hotel literature doesn t mention it but there is a terrace on the roof  floors up great for a smoke and a view of the other skyscrapers and a little bit of the lake  The sign says no glass allowed so I sat in the sun with a couple of cans of Fosters from the convenience store  There is a bar by the lobby but no restaurant not that you need one here  There was noisy construction work going on opposite which probably accounted for the dirty windows but you can t blame the hotel for that  The air con unit was a big museum piece but it worked fine and was needed as the temperature hit  degrees on our last day  One small criticism though there is no safe  strong box in the room and the hotel won t take any responsibility for valuables being stolen so I was constantly handing in my camcorder and DVD player at the lobby for safe keeping  Better safe than sorry This hotel can t compete with the Hiltons riotts and Hyatts on the standards of furnishings and fittings but all in all it was definitely worth  a night  My wife loved the shops on the Mag Mile but apart from the Billy Goat Tavern I couldn t find one singe bar or pub  
P => Location is KEY A friend and I stayed here for  nights over spring break  We checked in on a Wednesday and there was no wait  The girl at the front desk had us down for a one bed room but I asked if she had any rooms available with two beds and she said yes  Very surprising to us we got a corner room with  windows on the st floor second to the top   the views were amazing The room was ently sized big enough for us and very clean  The best thing about the Best Western Inn of Chicago is that it is located literally in the middle of everything  It is a short half block walk to Michigan Avenue across from the Virgin Record Store and between the Gap and Guess  Walking to north and south Michigan Avenue is a quick short stroll  Everything is nearby I wouldnt stay anywhere else as far as location goes  We walked everywhere and if we didnt feel like walking   we definately made use of the CTA public busses they were so convenient   If you are going to use busses which you probably will because walking does get tiresome   go to any place around that says quotChecks Cashed herequot and you can get the CTA bus and subway pass it will definately save you a lot of money rather than paying the  each way on busses  Make sure to ask the person what each card holds so you can find the right one for your trip depending on how much you will use it  Also the subway or the L is about  blocks up from the hotel which we used to do shopping in Wicker and Lincoln park  The L is really a lot easier to figure out than we thought  Overall this hotels location was amazing  It was so convenient to be able to walk everywhere literally  Whether it was up and down Michigan Ave  or to Navy Pier walking wasnt too far for us to handle  With our hotel being so close it was nice because we could stop at our hotel for a few minutes between things we were doing  And walking at night was fine   we felt so safe because there were a lot of people out on the street even at like  or  p m   
P => Ideal for the budget minded    We stayed here in the summer of  for three nights  For downtown Chicago it was incredibly well priced  However on arrival this was obviously down to the rather tired or and general need of reation for the hotel  Its location is ideal being just one block off Michigan Avenue Magic Mile and the concierge service was very helpful  We were staying in the middle of a heatwave and the air con in our room struggled to keep up without making an awful noise  The room itself was comfortable if again a little well worn On the whole not a bad experience but if you pay extra there are many other nearby hotels that look a lot better  
P => Great Hotel Me and my cousin was here with my brothers family on wacation  Were from NorwayAnd we stayed on this Hotel for  week of two  Now we didnt stay on the hotel that much its so much to do in Chicago  But when we where there I must say I enjoed myour stay  So I reccomend this hotel for everyone stayng in Chicago   Christian PS I apologize if my English is poor    PPS I dont have any Pics of the hotel   
P => Acceptabe Hotel Great Location Horrible Service I checked into the Best Western Inn of Chicago uary   for two nights  The hotel is old in appearance  I found the rooms to be small but acceptable  I knew I wasnt statying at the Hyatt  The problem I have with this hotel is the service  Monday night I needed to access the internet for school  At no point on the web site during my reservation or check in did do they mention that you only get wireless high speed internet access on the th floor and above  I was told that they have hot spots for wireless access in the lobby  Problem solved right Wrong  I could not get a signal in the lobby  No one behind the front desk had any solutions and when I explained to the attendant at the check in desk my dilemma she said and I quote quot I dont know what to tell youquot  Another employee suggested that I use dial up from my phone line in the room  That would be good except for the  cents per minute charge after thirty minutes for a local number  When asked if the phone charge could be waived due to the lack of the hotel providing the wireless internet access it advertises first the attendant let out a little silly lh and then said no  Finally out of frustration and the lack of time to argue I went to the top floor  where I sat on the floor in the hallway to get a signal  If location and price is important to you then its not a bad hotel  If you expect courtesy and for the front desk staff to assist you with problems you encounter you  want to stay somewhere else  Good location acceptable hotel poor service and misleading advertisement  
P => Great location Great price great value My dhters and I wanted to spend a couple of days in Chicago over Christmas break and do some shopping without spending a fortune on the room  This hotel met all our expections and then some  We were close to the Magnificant Mile for all the great shopping and within walking distance to great restaurants and the subway  The free trolley to Navy Pier was a great perk as well but we could easily have walked there as well  The concierge desk was helpful with directions and everyone was helpful and friendly  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Best Western a Great surprise What a pleasant surprise I cant lie   when I heard quotBest Westernquot     I was a little bit worried  I was pleasantly surprised at the nice room and the excellent service received at this secret gem of a hotel in the most perfect location on Michigan Avenue Upon check in the desk clerk could not have been any nicer He upgraded me to a corner room on the th floor which I am assuming was larger than most rooms  We had  double beds see photos a nice TV unit a table  chairs and plenty of spaceThe bathroom was small but very adequate  photos It was lacking in any counter space or hooks which was a bit difficult with three of us sharing a room I cant think of a better location  I have stayed on North Michigan Avenue and also near the Wacker Bridge   but this location was so central that I really think it was the best of both worlds  The views from our TWO windows were great photosThe concierge was VERY helpful with directions suggestions bus information etc If she was not there the front desk staff knew lots of info tooI would definitely stay in the Inn of Chicago again for the great rate that we got  
P => Good but Some Problems I just spent three nights here  I arrived  hours before check in time on a busy Sunday afternoon and my room was ready  Yes the room is small but it was adequate  The bathroom also small showed signs of revent reation and was fine  The shower water pressure was excellent The staff treated me very well and the concierge was helpful  The only real drawback is the heating cooling system  There is only an on off switch and is just does not work very well  Fortunately the weather was very nice so it was not a problem  I dont think I would want to stay here in the Summer  
P => Funny    I have stayed here in the past and although the rooms are small it is a clean and well kept hotel  I called to make reservations for a suite this ust  and the reservationist asked how many people I said  then she polietly asked what was bringing me to the area I said it was my birthday  She then changed her tone and immediately says quotfirst let me statequot we dont allow parties      I said Oh no its nothing like that just me and my boyfriend      Im  yrs  old but geez    not a quotOh how nice its your birthday or quotthats nice heres a nice room for youquot    just right off the bat quotWe dont allow partiesquot I was pretty much instantly turned off from making the reservation  I even thought I would looked into a birthday package room or special occassion package rate but I think Ill look elsewhere  
P => Location Location Location Lets get one thing straight  This is not a  star hotel but it is clean fair priced and close to everything Sure there are minor room imperfections such as peeling wallpaper and loose tiles in the bathroom but if you like to see the city on a budget then this is for you We stayed here for the Chicago athon and loved it  The room was a ent size had all the basic amenities and had a friendly atmosphere  We really enjoyed the fact that everything was so close  Michigan Ave is a half block away and the subway was about  blocks away  If you want to be close to the action without paying a mint then stay here  If you want to be pampered then stay at the Drake or the Intercontinental  
P => Not really sure    I agree with the other reviewers that this hotel is in a wonderful location and was an excellent price but I just didnt think it had a very nice feel about it  The room was small and dark with just a tiny dirty window to peer out of and while we had a non smoking room the bathroom always smelt a little like smoke I am not really sure about other hotels in Chicago this being my first time to the city which I absolutely loved by the way but I would say if you have two choices Best Western Inn and another choose the other That said cant fault the location or the price  
P => Perfect Location My husband and I recently stayed at the Inn of Chicago and thought it was the perfect location  One block from the Miracle Mile and shopping and close to walking south across the river to the Art Institute of Chicago  Our room was on the st floor corner room so we had an excellent view of the city  The room was clean comfortable and the people that work there were more than helpful  We drove and the parking lot is conveniently located one half block from the hotel  Many restaurants to choose from  The hotel has a continental breakfast for   that was adequate  The only complaint is the wait to get our room  We waited more than  hour and when the room was ready they failed to let us know we were sitting in the lobby  The rates were great and we would stay there again  
P => Good Hotel Stayed in here from t th   nd and we both loved this hotel for the locationJust off N Michigan Ave behind Guess Jeans Granted the lobby looked like something from a s movie but once checked in the room was very tidy and clean if not a tad smallBut hey when your exploring downtown how much time do you want to spend in your hotel room The staff were all very helpful and knowledgable the concierge was great with ideas and loads of vouchers saving us money on things like the Hancock and Sears Towers Didnt try their breakfast bar but again who wants to eat in their hotel when a whole city is waiting for your tourist dollars   As with other reviews try the Cambridge House accross the road they have a great breakfast menu there and after eating there for  mornings we were impressed every time And once again the location was great was were able to be shopping mins after we left the hotel lobby and were in walking distance for everything the city had to offer more or less though we did walk some miles in   daysIf you want a cheap hotel in great area then look no further Only exception was the pan handlers around the area then again with so much money around there where else would they go to get handouts 
P => Great location  Right Price  Having never stayed at a Best Western before I was hesitant about what to expect  I was pleasantly surprised at its superb location   one block off Michigan Avenue and within walking distance of plenty of great restaurants bars and shopping  I especially liked that just a few blocks west was Blue Chicago a terrific nightclub with live music every night We reserved two rooms through their website and were upgraded without having to ask to a King suite on the corner facing the lake  These arent the fanciest rooms but they are clean and well appointed with all of the basics  And when one of our toilets broke it was fixed instantly without any hassle  Plenty of cabs were available and valet parking was fast and courteous Also theres a no frills coffee shop that serves tasty breakfast right across the street so you can fuel up for the day before enjoying the Magnificent Mile  In all at night it was a great choice that Id recommend  
P => Great Location Stayed here early y  This place is very good value as an inexpensive hotel in a first rate location just off the Magnificent Mile  The downside is that the rooms are small and have a slightly careworn feel although ours was clean and efficiently maintained  The staff were conspicuously helpful  You could pay a lot more in Chicago without doing noticeably better  
P => brilliant chicago hotel  mins walk to a beach one way  mins to all the shops downtown chicago has to offer in the other direction hotel is a typical best western rooms very standard issue clean just generally exactly what youd expect would stay again 
P => My take on this place We reserved and quotheldquot  rooms for  nights here via the Best Western Website both non smoking  queen beds per room  Upon our arrival we were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms one of which had only had single bed It was late and we didnt have many options  we took them One room the one with  bed had a great view of a ventelation unit  The other room both on th floor had a good crop of mild growing in the combo bathshower and peeling wallpaper in the bedroom  Both had noisy under window AC units Day  we got to change rooms they were satisfactory the AC units were much quieter Starting at  AM the maids start knocking on doors quotHousekeepingquot on day  we heard the knocks sounded like the were coming from across the hall to our surprise the maid entered our room one of us was still getting dressed quotOops sorryquot then she left  On our last night there was a quotpetquot in our room I think I killed it  Couldnt find it after the second stomp Other observations good location State Steet and Michigan Avenue are close Nice little exercise room on the th floor The lobby carpet needed to be cleaned shampooed dark and grimy  They were vacuuming it upon our arrival good place to start  Upon checking out complained about the dirty smoking room from first night  They knocked  off the st nights rate  Not much of compenation for our trouble For breakfast the coffee shop across the street not very good  Other places nearby much better we liked the place across the street from the Holiday Inn a  blocks away  If you like that sort of thing there is a Duncan Donuts across the street  
P => Wow  We booked three rooms and got suites all on the top floor  The space was fantastic  We had erate bedrooms with sunken tubs and sitting rooms with wet bar  The roof terrace was beautiful  Chicago  be the windy city but from the roof terrace the sun shines without the hint of the breeze you get at street level  The check clerk and concierge were very helpful and for around   per night we were treated like Kings  The panoramic view from our suite was great day amp night  Excellent location for Navy Pier Michigan Ave etc 
P => Great Room Great Price We spent three nights at this hotel and were very pleased  The room was clean comfortable and well orated  The staff were friendly and knowledgeable  The hotel is located in an area with lots of restaurants and less than a block from Michigan Avenue close to public transportation  We would assuredly recommend this hotel to any Chicago visitor  
P => Great value location clean Great value and location  Not deluxe but it is in great shape with clean new carpets and everything in fine working order  Staff is helpful and knowledgable  Lobby is very nice  Location is wonderful with a year old typical Chicago coffee shop right across the street and an excellent breakfast restaurant down a block West Egg  We dont have a lot of experience with downtown hotels but after comparing prices this place did us fine  If you are not the type to hang out in the hotel room but want a central launching point to see Chicago want to be in a safe area with a great value on parking day  block away this is the place  Rooms are not real big but sufficient  Broadband and wireless Internet starts on floor  not a well publicized fact  
P => Perfect Location My family and I have stayed at the Inn of Chicago many times and will continue to do so  The hotel itself is not oppulent but its clean and very comfortable and is so close to Michigan Ave  etc  A great Italian restaurant is about a block away called Volare there is a coffe shop right across the street and a Dunkin Donut acroos the street  The staff is always courteous and helpful and the rates are very reasonable  The outstanding feature though is the location  
P => Pretty Darn Good  I was pretty impressed with this hotel  It definitely is not the Ritz but the hotel was clean and comfortable  There is wireless internet on some of the floors every floor does not have wireless which can be helpful  I think it is located in a good spot if youre a tourist  Its a few blocks from the Chicago River right off of Michigan Ave  and close to Rush Street and all the shopping   etc  on Michigan Ave The size of the rooms are ent the bathrooms are a bit small but adequate and the beds are fairly comfortable If you can get a good deal its worth the price  
P => Nice Location Clean Rooms Friendly Staff  friends and I stayed at this hotel ch     I got two rooms via Hotels and made my choice based on  reviews from this site and  price  Knowing what I know now about the hotel I would make the same choice again The location was good   right downtown near everything  The hotel lobby and rooms were clean  The staff was friendly  The area in which the hotel was located wasnt a bad or scary area  The rooms themselves were average in size not tiny but not apartment sized  The bathrooms were small but adequate  We were on the th floor and had rooms on opposite sides of the hotel and each had views of the city The subway station was only about   blocks away but it seemed farther when the temperatures dropped and the wind picked up  There is a Dunkin Donuts and Burrito Beach across one street and the Cambridge House restaurant across the other  One review on this site said great things about Cambridge House    its not bad if you dont want to walk too far and their service is really fast but the food really wasnt anything to brag about  Timothy OTooles  blocks away had good food and drinks Rock Bottom Brewery wasnt too far away near the subway actually and theyre pretty good too  Starbucks was also nearby  
P => Value for money The BW Inn of Chicago is in a fantastic location just off the Magnificent Mile  It is easy to reach from Ohare Airport by  trains costs about    and takes about an hour  The hotel itself is warm and welcoming  The rooms are basic but more than comfortable and well cleaned each day  The Concierge provides helpful information if you persist some are more helpful than others Robert was helpful  We didnt eat at the hotel but there are loads of fantastic places to eat close to the hotel and there is a cinema also just round the corner  You cant beat this hotel for good value but I must say it isnt a luxury hotel so if youre looking for luxury go elsewhere  
P => Great Location    Better Price This is a wonderful hotel to stay at in Chicago  Its so close to Michigan Ave  literally half a block and is very nice for the cost of the rooms  Weve stayed there several times in the past and will definitely stay again in the future  The lobby is very nice and clean and the rooms are great also  Its not the nicest hotel in the city but its definitely not a dive  The only thing that wasnt great is that the bathrooms are a little small     but how much time do you spend in the bathroom anyway  I would recommend this hotel to any family and friends of mine who are visiting chicago  
P => Good Value Tourist Hotel In Super Location The Inn Of Chicago as its known is a  star tourist class hotel located on East Ohio Street less than  minutes walk from Michigan Avenue   The Magnificent Mile of the Windy City  The hotel is  stories high and features a gym and rooftop terrace  The lobby area is small and somewhat shabby the breakfast roomdiner is also orated s style and in need of updating  Rooms themselves are clean and tastefully orated with air conditioning TV safe iron  At the request of a room with a view I was offered a South facing room on the st floor  The view from here is great you have a panorama featuring Lake Michigan The Chicago River just visible and the huge NBC Tower amongst others My bathroom was small and although modernised was obviously done on the cheap as many fittings were not well secured  The water flow was also very poor and not always hot  Toiletries were provided but were not worth using as the quality was not good I participated in a breakfast on the first morning  but it was not worth the money as there are only a few things on offer and its unattractively laid out on a small table in the lobby level diner  There is a breakfast restaurant across the street which is far more appeallingThe location is the extra star in the hotels rating and is a shoppers dream come true  Youre also a stones throw from tourist attractions such as Navy Pier Lake Michigan and The Hancock Centre where youll see the best possible view of the City dont think because Sears Tower is higher that the view is better  Dont miss out on the Cheesecake Factory below the Hancock Centre after your visit   it is a cracking restaurant Date of stay  st rd   
P => Spot on tourist hotel My boyfriend and I visited Chicago from Boxing Day to New Years Eve   We stayed at the Best Western Inn of Chicago throughout the stay and were both pleased with the hotel The hotel in itself could do with a refurbishment   the lobby and or in the rooms is not very promising however the rooms are clean and comfortable and perfect for tourists   at the end of the day all you need your hotel for is as a place to sleep and shower The location of the hotel is excellent   a half block from the Magnificent Mile but still close enough to walk into the Loop  Perfect for first time visitors to Chicago like us My only word of warning for anyone considering staying in this hotel is to avoid a room next to the gym  The gym hours are  AM to  PM and the walls being quite thin the sound of the treadmills is unbearable if you are trying to get some sleep and recover from jet lag Apart from that I would certainly stay in the hotel again and for reasonably priced tourist accomodation I would say the Best Western Inn of Chicago is a very good bet  
P => Great location Although the standard queen room was smaller than expected it was very comfortable clean and adequate for our stay  In general the hotel is an old building but appears to have been refurbished and is well maintained  The concierge was very helpful  When I mentioned we were going to the Walnut Room at Fields for lunch she gave us a card to present that put us at the front of the line without waiting  The hotel also arranged a fixed taxi rate going to the airport which was less than we have payed previously  We got a good deal through Expedia and would stay here again for that price  
P => Great location half block of Michigan Avenue This hotel was in a great location for shopping just half a block of Michigan avenue  Although the lobby is a bit dismal the rooms are good The air conditioning gave a few problems but the maintenance guy arrived within  minutes of reporting the problem I certainly would stay there again  
P => Second time Stay  Better than the first nd Visit to Chicago and the nd time Ive stopped in the Best Western  Great hotel and great location  You just cannot argue with this place for the price  The staff are helpful the valets are great and the stay was most pleasant  When you visit Chicago on a budget you just cannot go wrong here  Trust me  The only    problem I had with the place was restaurant  Very rarely open at the times us BRits like to eat  You either have to catch breakfast very very early and if you ide to go for dinner make sure you eat before pm  Us Pats like a later more sedate affair  
P => Cant wait for next stay Four nights here in ober  An excellent location just off the Mag Mile  yards from the Red Line and within reasonable walking distance of downtown attractions This is not a luxury hotel but is very competitively priced for its standard and location Contrary to one reviewers opinion I found the cleanliness and maid service to be of the highest order  Staff were polite and all requests were accommodated promptly I will if possible stay at this hotel on my next visit to Chicago  
P => Graet Hotel  A lot better inside than it looks from the outside  Staff very helpful  Perfect location  The quotCambridge Housequot diner across the road is excellent too  
P => Great Location Hotel is in a great location but do not expect luxury  I had booked a non smoking room  When we arrived there were non available  The room had a very strong tobacco smell but is was large and clean  The hotel has seen better days it looks a bit sad and needs some love and attention  If you are only staying a few days and you are out most of the time this hotel is fine  The staff were helpful and very friendly  
P => Excellent choice of accomodation Best Western Inn of Chicago was an excellent choice  Initially upon entering the room it seemed to be a bit dark and cheesy much like most of the hotels in England and Ireland  However once we got accostomed to the room we realized that it was not as bad as we thought  The elevators are a bit slow and the bed sheets didnt fit all the well but these were just minor inconveniences  Afterall the elevators at the riott quis in Times Square Manhatten take ten times as long as these elevators Location wise it doesnt get much better than this hotel  Across the street is a  hour convenience store a restaurant with ent breakfast and an excellent Burrito restaurant  It takes literally twenty seconds to walk to the main shopping street  Theres a Walgreens about  minutes walk away and theres an Internet Cafe in the neighbouring riott hotel  There are TONS of restaurants on East Ohio Street which add to the appeal of this hotel  Red Lobster Rainforest Cafe and others are about five minutes walk away from the hotel The Bell boys deserve special mention as they were extremely efficient  There is also a cab stand just outside the hotel that almost always has a cab  Other hotels in this area are far more posh but theyre also FAR more expensive  The price that we paid for a seven night stay was equivalent to the price quoted by nearby hotels for just two nights  If youre looking for luxury this is not the hotel for you  But if you want a FABULOUS location for an excellent price then book with confidence  
P => Fantastic location The location really was superb  Just steps away from the Magnificent Mile and handy for everything we wanted to see and do  The room was comfortable and perfectly fine for our needs  We were two friends sharing and were glad to be offered the chance of a larger room if we waited a little to check in   didnt see what the original one would have been like but we had a corner room which presumably gave us more space  Two things worth mentioning Id read complaints about the slow elevators and lack of fitted sheets on this site and thought people really did go over the top when pointing out faults  That is until I had to wait a full  minutes for an elevator and my sheet practically came off my bed in the night as it was just too small and didnt fit properly  However neither would put me off staying at this hotel The Newsmakers restaurantcafe was in our experience fine for a quick breakfast or lunch although it shut weirdly at pm  The bar wasnt great but then there are so many more exciting places to go than your hotel bar when youre in the heart of downtown Chicago  The concierge staff were most helpful with looking after left luggage ordering taxis etc  I would definitely come here again  
P => Great Service We stayed here for three nights in ust  What a relief Everyone was sooooo friendly and helpful and never seemed bothered by answering the same quottouristquot questions over and over again  It is in a great location and the price cannot be beat  By the way   Garretts popcorn on Michigan Ave  was the only place we found where the staff was so rude to the point of being ugly to its patrons  Dont go  There are other popcorn stands in town where they appreciate their customers and the popcorn is just as good if not better  
P => Whattadump I cant believe others are rating this dump favorably I had to remove the toilet paper roll to sit down it was the smallest hotel bathroom I have ever seen in my life  The AC was loud and inneffective  The elevators tiny and slow I ended up just walking down  flights of stairs rather than waiting for another full elevator  The       hairs in the bathtub from a previous guest just set the tone for my  day stay  Never again Ill tell my agent to put me up under a bridge rather than the BW Chicago  
P => Couldnt ask for a better location  We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of y  When we arrived the lady at reception was a little concerned that the room we had booked was too small for us for  nights so she upgraded us with no extra charge The room was clean and spacious but the bathroom was very small  Staff were usually happy to help and we were able to book discounted boat and trolley tours through the hotel  The hotel is in a perfect location for tourists  everything you need very close at hand  Only negative point  the air conditioner was a little too loud  
P => Central Location Arrived Wed at about  P M  and were able to check right in  Room was typical hotel room dbl beds armoire with TV and storage for small suitcaseand  drawers  Room was on th floor with ent view to south  Staff was helpful in answering our questions concerning siteseeing and arranging for a van type cab to take  people to the train station  The location of the hotel is great for shopping on Mich Ave or walking to Navy Pier or hitting the beach  The rooms and halls have recently been reated and are clean and comfortable  A patio area on the roof nd floor provides a nice view of the surrounding area including the lake the NBC building and the Hancock Tower  The coulple of negative items are no exhaust fan in the bathroom and no fitted sheets on the beds  Across the street are restaurants and convience stores  
P => Great hotel for the price and LOCATION I stayed here just this past weekend and have to say for my first time in Chicago the Best Western was a great value for the location   a night  Our intent was to find a place that was clean and friendly nothing fancy or over catered      just a nice place to rest your head after being out and about all day        and Best Western Inn was great  It was clean beds were of average hotel comfort the hotel was very quiet and the staff was very helpful and friendly  The only real down sides I think most people will find is that the room is a tad small as is the bathroom  The location is awesome right in the heart of the Magnificient Mile  The restaurant across the street quotThe Cambridge Housequot is perfect for breakfast The food is fast affordable and most importantly tastes great  Also anyone visiting Chicago has to eat at the quotCheesecake Factoryquot        best cheescake and the best food I have ever tastedYes this is no  star fancy all out hotel but if your looking for a friendly clean simple hotel thats affordable and in a great location this is a great choice  
P => Thanks Best Western Inn of Chicago Last weekend was our one year anniversary and my first trip to Chicago  The Best Western Inn of Chicago upgraded us to a beautiful suite on the nd floor   completely unexpected The room was large clean and quiet  We had a beautiful view of the city and Lake Michigan  They have a wonderful observation k as well  We were centrally located well within walking distance to great restaurants the Miracle Mile and Navy Pier  The staff was friendly and helpful  We recommend the Best Western Inn of Chicago to anyone who wants quality and value  
P => great hotel for the money We just returned from  days at the Best Western Inn of Chicago  I had over analyzed the reviews on this and other websites prior to booking but my concerns were put to rest the moment we arrived  Yes the suites bathrooms and elevators are small   it is an old hotel  But the service was excellent the hotel was clean and the location cannot be beat Just steps from the Magnificent Mile Navy Pier restaurants theatre shopping    I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and will definitely be staying there when I return to this beautiful city 
P => We loved the hotel and the city of Chicago My husband and I just returned from Chicago  We were in town for three nights and stayed at the Best Western  First of all it is in a great location  We loved being able to walk everywhere  It is extremely close to the Navy Pier  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful  We were on the th floor  Second of all the city of Chicago was amazing  everyone was so friendly  we loved our trip You can walk to the John Hancock building from the hotel  We would absolutely stay here again   
P => Great Value My husband and I just returned from the Best Western Inn and we thought it was an excellent value  At  per night which was over the Memorial Holiday weekend we thought the room was clean nicely orated and in an excellent location  The rooms are on the small side as is the bathroom but this is the perfect hotel for those who want to stay in a nice well located hotel and save their money for shopping and dining Across the street is Cambridge House restaurant which is a great place for breakfast before heading out for the day  There is also a convenience store across the street and Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins next door  
P => Good Price   Great Location This hotel was a great price and in a perfect location  Short and visually interesting walks to shopping dining and Navy Pier  The staff were very helpful and friendly although the front desk seems to be understaffed  I was on the rd floor and although the room was small it was clean and sufficient for one or two people  The upper floors were much nicer and the rooms were more up to date  Complaints are Extremely slow elevators   you could be waiting up to five minutes for one the stairways were too dark and a little creepy to use Noise from other rooms and the hallways could be heard clearly from inside your room   I could hear my neighbours conversations clearly from my room Ice and pop machines on every floor would definitely be an advantage   especially since the elevators are too slow and the stairways are creepyOverall this hotel was good for the price and I would stay here again  
P => Mixed Review for a   Stay This property has its positives and negatives On the plus side the location is wonderful just  block from Michigan Ave  blocks from the Wrigley Building and about a  mile walk from the entrance of the Navy Pier Floors  and  were well appointed and clean  My room  was clean yet small Room service arrived quickly and tasty and the staff were friendly  Lastly there is a wonderful terrace on the nd floor in which you can bring your own lunch drinks etc and enjoy the city skyline day or night open until pm  On the negative side you are reminded it is a Best Western  The water pressure was low you have to wait for a bellman and front desk person because they are understaffed My bathroom was small as in just large enough for  person  In addition the windows in my room did not open so fresh air was a problem  Floors   need reating with some floors not looking so clean  Each of the  elevators were very small the public areas were hot no fresh air circulation the exterior of the building itself is wonderful but needs a good power washing ice machines are on every other floor and noise from the hallway and other rooms was a problem If you stay here request a room away from the following Ice and soda machines elevators and the entrance to the terrace on the nd floor Bottom line I paid  per night for a king room that was small yet well appointed  For a budget hotel if location is more important than a good shower then so long as you stay on the  or nd floor the value is wonderful If however you need service or stay on floors   I would suggest looking into the Courtyard by riott or the Red Roof Inn both of which have equally good locations and look more refreshing and clean  The property is owned by Shell Hospitality and on their website it states that the property was reated in  but other than floors  and  I did not see where the reation looked new  
P => above average My husband dhter and I stayed at the B W  Inn of Chicago   th for  nights  As a travel agent I have stayed in many hotels over the years  I read the reviews before booking and was very pleased with this hotel  As other people have stated the staff at this property are very helpful and courtious  We did have a deluxe room which was very tastefully done the bathroom was small but not that small There is a little shelf to put your makeup bag on  For the price and location this is a very nice hotel and I would definately stay there again  
P => Best Value For A Prime Location This hotel is not as plush as the Drake or the Four Seasons but its in a prime location just off the Magnificant Mile  The building is quite old from the s but has been reated and has a charming quality about it  The rooms are smaller than average as are the bathrooms  Most of the rooms have great views of the surrounding cityscape  There is a nice little coffee shop just off the lobby as well as a cozy little bar  There is a White Hen convenience store just accross the street and a nice affordable family style restraunt next door to that  The location can not be beat  Michigan Avenue is steps away going west and the lakefront and Navy Pier is just a few blocks to the east  The area is surronded by fabulous restraunts and of course some of the best shopping IN THE WORLD  The hotel was quite clean the service was above average and the price could not be beat  Use your AAA card for discount on room rate  I have stayed at more then  hotels in and around the city over the years  For the price and location this hotel is the best value in the city

P => Great theme hotel As with all Hard Rocks if you love rock amp roll history and memorabilia this is a wonderful place to stay  The older hotel adds a lot of charm and the rooms are clean quiet and very comfortable  
P => Nicely Restored and Trendy Too This was the designated hotel for a conference I attended  On arrival the lobby is not overly welcoming more of a bar and meeting scene than anything else  Once checked in the room proved to be on the austere side comfortable enough but somewhat dark and cold  The room was exceptionally quiet even though it faced a busy street  I did not eat at the hotel but the China Grill in the lobby smelled terrific hopefully another time The Concierge and bell staff were very helpful and pleasant  The hotel is somewhat overpriced for what it is but the location cant be beat  If I was  years younger I might have enjoyed the stay more but really no complaints of significance  
P => Depressing hotel Went to Chicago on business and stayed at the Hard Rock  I was very disappointed with the rooms   very dark and small Not only are the walls dark but the lighting is very dim very bad on the eyes  I had a beautiful view of the ac vent with a large dead apitated bird on the roof right outside my window  That was lovely  My room was soo hot   the temperature control didnt work  There was no dresser in the room so there was no place expect for  small drawers to place my clothes  I was there for  nights and hate living out of a suitcase  The bar downstairs I found very disappointing  No matter where you go you can always count on a Hard Rock Bar for a good time and the feel of home  Not this one  Felt it was too trendy and yuppie for a Hard Rock   and expensive With the abundance of hotels in Chicago there is no way I would stay here again  
P => Great location   way overpriced BORING Um   this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  Although the location is very convenient    there are many hotels that you can get for the same price that are a million times nicer  For the price I paid I was expecting something extremely nice    but this is like a fancy motel   Im sorry but I just feel ripped off  Does anyone else feel this way 
P => Not Worth the Money My boyfriend and I were in Chicago for a wedding downtown and wanted to stay somewhere onnear Michigan Ave  The price was night and for that kind of money I thought it would be much nicer than it actually was  The pros   the location is wonderful right between the Michigan Ave  shopping and Millenium Park the room was big and the bed was really comfortable  The cons   the price of both the room and parking   per day the lighting there were no overhead lights in the room and only dim lamps and it was really difficult to put on makeup and even find things in your luggage there was no fan in the bathroom  The hotel wasnt bad I just think you should be able to find more for your money somewhere else  
P => Will stay there agian We stayed at the Hard Rock      My husband and I were traveling with another couple and sharing one room  Upon arrival we were greeted by a Darren at the front desk who was very friendly and accomodating  From reading on this website I knew to ask for a room with a nice view  He saw that there were  of us staying in a room and told us that for   more a night we could upgrade to a mini suite  We asked to see the standard room and the mini suite he took us right up to see a corner mini suite on the st floor and then a standard room on the th telling us about the history of the building on the elevator ride  We were sold on the mini suite  The mini suite was very roomy and comfortable for  adults with  queen sized beds and very nice linens  There was a wide hallway behind the bedroom area with  armoires we were able to place all our luggage on the floor there so we werent tripping over it there was only  suitcase holder  The bathroom was nice and big wih a huge window  The bedroom area had  windows facing south where we could see Millenium Park  There was also  large windows facing east into an office building where about  minutes after getting into our room we spotted a guy with binoculars looking into our room at us  Fortunately all the windows had opaque shades we kept those pulled down during office hours  There is a lack of lighting it is still dark in those rooms at night with all  lamps on We were very happy with our stay  The staff was very nice and accomodating  The business center is open  hours and you can use their computers and printer with no extra charge  If we are ever back in Chicago we will stay again  
P => A rocking Location Just spent  nights at the Hard Rock on a wistle stop tour in Chicago at the start of a tour around the USA  The best thing about the hotel is the location which is just over the river on Michigan Ave only a couple of hundreds yards form all the serious shopping on the magnificant Mile  The rooms are of a good size for a city centre hotel and are pretty comfortable as long as you stay as high as you can due to road noise  The room service food was poor and quite expensive but if you avoid this your stay will be enjoyable  One thing me wife did not like was the fact that the rooms are poorly lit so it made getting ready make up etc a little tricky  Things to make sure you experince in Chicago include the Shedd Aquarium the river tour and the Cheesecake factory below Hancock Tower  
P => Ok if you get a good rate Got a late room through Priceline for  on a weekend  Was billed as  stars  Wasnt that good but ok overall  Lobby is fairly small and dark going for the hipster art nouveau look I guess Check in was easy and people were friendly  Theme of course is rock  Not sure that adds anything to the experience really however  The room was fine but on the small side  One lamp so modern never did figure out how to turn it on and the room was dark in general  Hair dryer didnt work but bathroom clean and mattress good  Biggest complaint was both hall and street noise in room  Should be better if really stars  Location good and exercise room free so big picture we were satisfied  If this place expects to get  a night for a room it will be in trouble  
P => Outstanding Service at the Hard Rock My Fiancee and I returned to Chicago a day early after a visit to my Grandmother  We were both less than enchanted with the hotel wed stayed at for the first part of the visit and ided to try out the Hard Rock despite the fact that we both prefer locally owned hotels and BampBs I loved the Hard Rock   its in an Art o building in the heart of the Loop walking distance to all kinds of shopping and restaurants and destinations  We were both a little scattered for our trip Im always pretty flaky Fiancee had a cold and the staff really went above and beyond for us The front desk staff was great friendly and efficient during our check in  Fiancees cold knocked him out cold as soon as we got to the room  I think that the stunningly good linens down comforter and fake fur pillow wonderful for a couple on vacation and missing their pet cat made him ever happier to sleep the entire visit  He was fine the next day much to my relief  The bathroom wasnt the greatest style over function and the room was a little small but overall I really enjoyed it  The mini bar was fun and we had a great view  The or was great really held together but I found all the silver and gray to be a little cold Since Fiancee was out like a light I ided to do some work   I had to use the hotel computers to take care of some business one of my work programs isnt compatible with my Mac laptop and actually had to get the IT guys help to load the program on the hotel computer  He could have easily said no and I wouldnt have held it against him but he went to a great deal of trouble to make sure I could get my work done I got good dinner recommendations from the staff  I stopped by the boutique and got great service there  And when I forgot a ring in our room everyone from the front desk to the bellman to the housekeeping staff made sure I got it back again  Even the valet was nice and they had a radiant heater outdoors you can wait under while the valet gets your car   that was appreciated This isnt really the point but almost all the staff I saw at this hotel were hot male and tattooed  Im sure the female staff is stunning too and I just wasnt there on their shift From now on when Im in Chicago Im staying here  
P => Not impressed with Hard Rock I booked this hotel spur of the moment without consulting the reviews on trip advisor  I was definitely concerned after reading reviews on here but I ided to stick with it because I know you cant please everyone While Hard Rock wasnt the most awful place I feel like it wasnt worth what I paid  I knew the rooms would be small and dark but I didnt mind   we werent planning on speding a lot of time at the hotel  What did bother me was basic cleanliness and attention to detail that I expect from a hotel of this nature  The shower had absolutely no water pressure there was no bathrobe to be found the room was boiling hot even with the thermostat set to  degrees the maid service barely cleaned the room or the hallways each day  Dirty cleaning rags were left by the TV drinking glasses were not refreshed ice bucket wasnt emptied and dishes and trash were left outside the room for days The best thing I can say about this place is the location  Its prime for getting around the city  With that being said there are many other hotels nearby that Ill choose next time I visit Chicago  
P => dirty and way over priced My husband and I always stay in chicago for our anniversary  This year we choose to stay at the hard rock and we were very disappointed  We looked at pictures on line and we thought it looked very cool  The lobby had me very impressed at check in  The service was good at check in also  Thats were the satisfaction ended  The first step off the elevator proved to be what was to come  The hall way window had a dirty glass on the ledge left over from room service and the window looking out was filthy  As we entered the room the first thing we seen was another filthy window and the walls we also very dirty  I would strongly recommend asking for a room with a view  Our room had three windows which would have been great had there been a view of something other then roof tops  The first thing I did was draw the curtains and turn on the lights  I feel that if I pay   to stay one night that the room should be spotless and as I looked I had wondered if the shower had even been cleaned  The glass in the hall window was also still there on the day of check out which leads me to think the house keeping is not very ambitious  I hate to dwell on the cleanliness but the whole hotel seemed to take a nose dive after that  No frills with this hotel  Compared to others in the area we were very disappointed  The lobby is nice but the rooms are what you pay for  
P => We Liked the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago We recently stayed at the Hard Rock for two nights as part of a meetingconference  Overall we would stay again  Since the hotel just opened the rooms are relatively new there are modern showers fluffy towels nice bed linens and the property has some historical ambiance off the lobby  Our corner room had windows on two walls so we could see views from both north and south  It was clean and quiet Regarding some of the other reviews on this post     we would agree that the staff is somewhat surly and arrogant but we only had to deal with them at check in  The lobby is like a W hotel dark loud music with popular bar    we could surely imagine the bar is wall to wall people on a Saturday night  The rate is high but that is the nature of Chicago in summer    we paid  plus tax which is what virtually every hotel on the Magnificent Mile was getting    overpriced yes but the big city American hotels have fully recovered since  So we would enthusiastically endorse this property  When you check in request a high floor room on an end and you are sure to enjoy magnificent views of the city  
P => WAY overpriced for its low quality rooms Over  bucks a night for a tiny room with crappy old furniture   my tv was sitting on a desk that had deep scratches in it and was terrible quality The hallways are dank old office building style since it was put inside an existing old building The bar is somewhat nice but also very expensive If my company wasnt footing the bill I would have been pretty upset I stayed at the W the night before same price and what a world of difference  That place is true chic luxury  Avoid the Hard Rock the room for its quality should be barely above Motel  rates   its a rip off  
P => Great Trip Awesome Place  The bar view is like no other  You can watch the outside street going by right from the inside bar  Its sleek and well rotated rooms we great  Its like walking through a music museum and you dont feel like its a hotel in some places of it Beautiful People beautiful location  I took my sister here for her first trip out of Indiana  She is  and truely loved the Hard Rock experience  Valet Parking clubs close by returants and people galore Its worth it to get a room High  The views are amazing  Definatley a repeat for me and my sister 
P => Great Location   Less than Great Staff Great location with above average physical amenities including clean rooms and comfortable linens  One note out of two rooms we rented there was only one robe for four guests   website states robes as an amenity  Overall the staff was accommodating with a couple of exceptions   conciege we dealt with two always seemed a bit hurried as if we were bothering them and the gift shop attendant when asked directions for the restaurant gave the rolled eyes look and an answer that let us know that we were definitley bothering her  The restaurant and front door staff were great though  We did get stuck on the elevator for a little over  minutes   a little scary   I would have expected the hotel manager to check with us to ensure we were okay   nothing but an apology from the building engineer  If quality service is important to you during a hotel stay I would look elsewhere as I will on my next trip to Chicago  If youre focused only on location and physical amenities youll do okay at the Hard Rock Chicago  
P => will go back I just spent  nights at the Hard Rock  Actually changed my plans at the last minute and am glad that I did  Awesome hotel  Very spacious room king size bed was extremely comfortable room was clean shower was greatstaff very friendly and helpful Great location walking distance to the Navy Pier Hard Rock Cafe House of Blues  I value these opinions when I book a trip thats why Im writing this Ive been to Chicago many times and this is my favorite place so far I stayed in a deluxe room and it was well worth the price  
P => Great hotel The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway  The rooms are quiet the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size  We had fabulous service and got a great rate  Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes its listed as an amenity and the Sony radio didnt work it was perfect  Would definitely stay there again 
P => Hard Rock Hotel   great location The Hard Rock Hotel was centrally located which was ideal  The hotel has great amenities and hip vibe  It was very easy to navigate the City and the hotel was near great shopping a free shuttle and Millenium Park  
P => Loved the Hard Rock Im very picky when it comes to hotels and have been struggling for months to find a favorite in Chicago but stayed here last week and I will surely be coming back  My room was enormous with beautiful views  and yes on one side there was another building across the way saw another post complaining about that on here but you just close the curtain if youre walking around nakedI visit Chicago every other week and have recently tried the W City Center W Lakeshore the Hyatt the Westin the Sheraton Le Meridien the Burnham the Hotel Monaco   and a couple others Im sure Im forgetting  But the Hard Rock was my favorite above all  The style is very cool the rooms are quite large mine was not unique amongst my colleagues service was excellent and the bed was one of the most comfortable Ive slept on in a while I was worried they wouldnt let me in without tattoos etc but the scene is actually on a par with a W hotel  
P => A little beat up Nice greeting upon arrival and I was assigned to a corner room on a high floor with lots of light  Unfortunately the room was just across from another building where people looked in on me  My bathroom had a plunger and toilet paper in it and one of the shades was hanging askew  i called down to the gentleman whod checked me whose first response was to send up an engineer to help me with the toilet  His second response was better he sent up a bellman to escort me to another room an upgrade on a higher floor  The rooms are comfortable uglychic with good bathroom amenities Aveda  The value and location are pretty good if you want to be on the edge of the loop  The lobby at night turns into a scene with pulsating groovy music and hip people on the couches  The funny thing is Im not sure if Id stay here again    after all was said and done I did like my final room where I had a good view out onto Michigan Avenue and a comfortable bed and a great shower  
P => th Floor Room   Not a great view I got a really good rate thru a promotional offer night But that included  drinks at the really cool bar in the lobby  I highly recommend the Upside Down tini taste like a yummy pineapple upside down cakeThe best thing about this hotel is it is NON SMOKING  I loved that Being from Los Angeles I guess I am spoiled but I like the fact that I can have a drink at a bar without someone blowing smoke in my face  My room was on the th floor and I agree with the other reviews it is a dark room  But I like the darkness of it it gives it a more intimate feel  The bathroom was a ent size and I really liked the Aveda bath products Yes the room is warm even after playing with the thermostat  But it wasnt a deal breaker for me since it was so cold outside  I am sure if it was in the middle of summer my opinion would be different Now my complaint is definitely the view on the th floor  I attached some pictures I took out of my window  Nothing to write home about  Seems with a half empty hotel they would have tried to give me a better view If I could get a good room rate I would probably stay here again and ask for a higher floor  
P => Not bad  matter of style over substance The Hard Rock has a different style to it  I had a fairly good size king room but no furniture to speak of other than a deskdresser ensemble rather cheap quality and a rather funky chair  Some might call this contemporary Id call it minimalist  Room wall colors are gray with the window wall black  No question that lighting is dim but again part of the style  Bathrooms were very roomy and overall quite nice  Same issues with temperature control as others have noted  I would say the crowd seemed mid to late twenties  This location is more in what I would term the business end of Michigan Ave  Most of the shopping restaurants and things to do at night are on the other side of the river further north on Michigan Ave  Ive stayed at many different hotels in Chicago  This was a unique experience but I dont think I would return  There are so many different hotels in what I think are better locations and that are a bit higher up on the luxury scale for relatively the same price  
P => Great location I recently went on a girls weekend to Chicago  Normally I stay at the Omni but they refused to accept a coupon I had so we picked the Hard Rock  Be sure to check their website before you make a reservation for weekends they often run promotions like buy one night get the second half off  Check in took a little while and we thought it was fairly humorous that the front desk personnel were singing along to the music playing  Room was fairly expensive but the location makes it worth while  I was a bit concerned that we would have charges for a deposit for the minibar but the bill was accurate and no issues Room was dark yes  There were two lamps on either side of the bed but certainly only provided ambiance not good for reading  The bathroom was a little dark too but no one had any problems putting on makeup  The bed was awesome as people have mentioned before  But be forewarned if you want a room with two beds the cost is night more  We had a window that overlooked the city so that helped with the light situation in the mornings  Didnt need so much light at night since we were out and about But upon our arrival back at the hotel no issues with the lights at all  Hallways were lighter than the rooms oddly painted but really cool  The lobby is modern and the bar gets packed early  Good thing there are several couches around the lobby to sit  Drinks are of course expensive ranging from   I would say for quotnormalquot drinks  I would suggest dressing up just a touch for the bar as everyone seemed to be dressed in business casual or better Location is definitely a plus  It is at the end of the miracle mile and just a short  blocks or so to Navy Pier  There are a ton of bars and restaurants nearby and the Intercontinental Hotel bar was very busy and one of our main hangouts  It is literally a block away Oh Chicago  I cant wait to return and I would definitely stay here again assuming that their prices are a bit lower or they offer another weekend special  
P => Too warm wont be back  Nice looking room comfortable bed  It s true the lighting is dim which I like however my wife would like a brighter light option in the bathroom for makeup etc  The reason I won t be back is because as I read in previous reviews the thermostat does nothing  Could not cool the room down  Very warm  If you like a cool room to sleep in try somewhere else  
P => I loved it Ok I read some of the reviews here after I booked the hotel and frankly I was worried  I got to Midway and took the orange line to LakeState stop and walked  blocks to N  Michigan and there was the hotel  So far so good  The woman at the front desk was very nice and apologized that the room was not ready yet it was  AM I wasnt expecting it to be ready but asked if we would like to stow our bags and call back in an hour  We stowed our bags went to explore the magnificent mile and came back three hours later and the room was ready  I was now panicked  The reviews said dark smelly dirty and rude  the rude part so far was untrue  Got to room  It was dark smelled fine and was pretty clean  As a base of operations one could not ask for more  Hard Rock is a block or two from Millenium Park a block to the Chicago river a nice hike to the Hancock Building but would be a nice stroll in warm weather walking straight up N  Michigan with all its great malls and stores in the summer would have been terrific unfortunately I just got back and its uary  Sears Tower also walking distance Navy Pier not so far  restauants on state street and ohio very walkable  Get the point The hotel elevators are so fast one could get the impression that they were your own private elevator  The fitness club was fine empty whenever I was there  The business center allowed me to surf the web   The bed we had was fantastic  It was firm with a pillowtop  Very comfortable  There was internet access in the room also I just didnt bring my computer so I used the business center  The one major issue that I had and its the only one it was DARK I guess rock n rollers are creatures of the night but this is really a bit much  I saw where a lot of the other hotels were such as the four seasons ritz carleton etc and a lot of the really fancy ones are further up on N  Michigan Magnificent Mile but to access the rest of the City south of the Chicago River It would kind of be a hike  Great stay great location great place  
P => The Hard Rock Hotel in the thick of things This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue a five minute walk from the Orange quotLoopquot line that will get you to and from Midway Airport  Forget about taking a taxi the train is a  ride and less than  minutes away Our room  was immaculate and spacious  sq ft we were told  orated in grays and white the room was comfortable and soothing not jarring  On the other hand we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading finding keys etc  No kidding  The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp  On the positive side however there were Aveda products in the bathroom the windows were huge so during the day there was tons of natural light and no issues with darkness  The king size bed was very firm but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting We had a largish TV with a DVD player  There is a safe and munchies  The gym is perfect equipped with treadmills ellipticals bikes and weights  It is open  and there is video surveillance for safety  There are towels water headphones disposable ear pads and complimentary green apples  Suggestion if you are on a floor below the nd take the elevator up to nd then down to L to get to the gym  This way you dont have to traverse the lobby The front desk staff is amiable and very attentive  I read some other reviews about nasty personnel but did not have that experience at all  I got a free newspaper with a smile a free stamp when I needed it change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning  The Hard Rock is located less than a  minute walk from the Water Tower the Drury Theater John Hancock and magnificent mile  For those who like a thrifty breakfast we recommend Gourmet Pantry at  N  Michigan Avenue       This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning no less    The hotel has a breakfast buffet for   per person but we did not partake of it We would stay at the Hard Rock again and think it is great for people with quottweens quot Not sure about the toddler set though  
P => Absolutely wonderful Experience I couldnt have asked for a better place to spend our th Wedding Anniversary  We stayed here from   to   and the entire experience was wonderful  Ive done my fair share of traveling to Hawaii Orlando Seattle and others but have never came away with such a great experience like I had at the Hard Rock Hotel  We had a Deluxe King room on the st floor with an astounding view of both the city and the river  True the room was smaller than most hotels ive stayed at but the overall experience far outweighed that small detail  The entire staff was very pleasant and went out of their way to make our stay pleasureable  The floor and room we were on were surprisingly quiet  There are some excellent soundproofing or something because even on a rowdy night like New Years Eve it was still very easy to get a good night morning sleep after partying  A lot of reviews on here complain mostly about the staff and the check in as well as the deposits required at check in  I was made very well aware of these possible pending problems and was prepared for the worst but everything came without a hitch  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anybody seeking a very classy yet edgy joint to escape from reality for awhile  
P => small and smelly we went to this hotel for new years eve  the room was tiny about  x  and the bathroom smelled of sewage  the staff were rude and check in took forever  furthermore the nye party sponsored by the hotel was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING dont stay here  take your money down the street to the sheraton where youll find a nice hotel with the same great location  
P => A great stay My husband and I had a great overnight at the Hard Rock Hotel directly off Michigan Avenue  I saw many negative reviews regarding the darkness and gloominess of the hotel lobby but its the Hard Rock Its edgy and modern and different  If you want the traditional old style Chicago hotel then choose somewhere else  But we loved the modern lines and the Hard Rock feel    great music  We were upgraded to a larger room and received very good service  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean and spacious  Great hi def  TVs  Very close to the Nordstrom mall and Millineum Park  Very cool bar right in the lobby  Will definitely return 
P => Location location location    We went to the Hardrock for the weekend  Our room was modern clean and offered a fair view  Though small the room was mildy luxurious  Check in was hectic but simple enough  All other staff we encountered were helpful polite and pleasant  The hotel is contained in an old office building that has been restored  This adds character  The refurb is well done  They have a premium product at the Hardrock   and they charge accordingly David Bowie stared at me as I used the toilet  Hints  Bennigans across the street is good for well Bennigans food but fast and cheap  The Old Timers Bar around the corner has cheap drinks but the food leaves much to be desired  Its a short walk to the train  blocks  
P => great ambiance and location This was a great hotel but as someone who stays at the HRH in Las Vegas a couple of times a year   I was disappointed  The ambiance is fun and trendy  The rooms are a little small   and I had to be moved to another room because the first one they put me in hadnt been cleaned very thoroughly  The front desks service varies depending on who you get  The room service is okay    nothing spectacular  Regardless the mojitos at the bar were good    its best to stick with the cheeseburger if youre ordering from room service   and it was close to shopping  If you can get a good rate its a good place to stay but it doesnt compare to the Peninsula  
P => Hard Rock was just okay   not the quality I expected I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and have the following suggestions to the hotel  Purchase fitted sheets for the beds  While the mattress and pillows were comfortable the fact that the bottom FLAT sheet came untucked the minute you got in bed was very disturbing  Be cognizant of how many guests are staying in the room  When you have two guests    supply enough towels per person  And please make a note when a guest call on Friday night requesting towels for two make sure housekeeping supplies the same number the next day   Make sure the food delivered via room service is warm    for cold french toast and waffle is a little extreme   Provide bathrobes   Check the minibar  Dont assume that just because someone picked up an item to investigate means they consumed the item In sumy with as many hotels as there are available in Chicago I will probably wouldnt recommend the Hard Rock to friends based on this first time stay for me  
P => Great for the cost Booked the hotel on Priceline for night  The hotel is excellently situated on Michigan Ave with easy access to the rest of the city The or of the hotel would not appeal to everyone and the room was a little dark but it appeared newly furbished was clean and the staff were friendly A good deal for the price I paid 
P => overpriced and snotty Well lets see  The only nice guy at that hotel was the bell hop  Upon the arrival to the hotel I was greeted and informed that there is a night deposit for the snack bar  The check in guys were incredibly rude and condescending  I also happened to lose my wallet and only had  in cash on me and the guy demanded that I came up with another   The room was ok  The or was really cool  The people were not  
P => Nice staff but overpriced We spent three nights at the Hard Rock in early y The good the staff is very good and the location is good  The beds are very comfortable  The building itself is architecturally unique  We were in town when there was a festival in Grant Park so we were close by  The bad rooms were very so so the on premises dining options were poor and the rooms were expensive for what you get  Our shower no bath leaked all over the bathroom floor We stayed at the Hard Rock because some friends that were were traveling with wanted to stay there  When I looke around we could have stayed at the Drake for the same price now That is a great hotel and unless you get a real deal I would not recommend the Hard Rock If you are on this end of Michigan Avenue have dinner at the Park Grill the restaurant is on the edge of Grant Park the food staff location are all great 
P => What a Depressing place the place is so dark and gloomy  its depressing The bath tub is half the size of a nornal tub the fixtures in the room are cheap i felt that I was in a s Holiday inn  There are a lot of other nicer Hotels in this area in the same price range  I cannot believe that they get away charging the prices that they do  I frequently stay downtown in that area and this is the worst room that I ever had  This is the last time I will stay at this hotel there are just to many better options  
P => Overpriced dysfunctional hotel The hotel and rooms were designed to be so uncomfortable it is unbelievable  The rooms which are so dark flashlights should be supplied lack storage space  There is simply no place to put anything  The lobby is a joke the noise is so loud that screaming is the only option when checking in  Worst is the heating system or lack of heating system  When I came into the room the temperature was  degrees  I set it in the low s and returned hours later to find it was still  degrees  I called the front desk where I received no help  They finally sent up an engineer who said that the heating system was not designed to work until the outside temperature fell below  degrees In other words there was nothing that could be done to get the room above   And this is supposed to be a  star hotel It should be condemned  
P => A little dark for my taste    To start Ill say the staff was friendly and helpful  They do pull off the rock n roll theme fairly well but in a dark and minimalistic sort of way  The colors are grey and black and the rooms have very little lighting even in the bathroom  The room had a small side chair with a low back so dont plan on kicking your feet up and relaxing unless you get on the bed  Nice bedding and pillows  No wireless but a ent highspeed wired connection is available  Our room wasnt filthy but it wasnt clean  Housekeeping seemed to have a problem getting the basin around our sink clean when we left it had the same gunked on toothpaste that was there when we arrived four days earlier  We returned one day at  in the afternoon after a full day of walking and sightseeing to get a quick nap before getting ready for our evening out  Much to our surprise the room had not been cleaned  My wife was on the phone with the folks in the lobby when the maid knocked on the door  We left the room to take our nap in the lobby which was a MAJOR bummer  Location is great hotel is pricey and mediocre in my opinion  
P => Good  Got to the hotel before checkin but the desk let us register early and checked our bags  Hotel or is dark and dreary not what you expect a Hard Rock should be  Very small hotel bed comfortable room dark and lighting horrible in the rooms  Hanging out at the bar is something you definitely want to skip  Staff extremely rude  My boyfriend and I went to Chicago to see a game a wrigley location of hotel is great right near the trains if you can figure out which one to get on were from new york  Chicagos train system is more confusing than at home  Magnificent mile is close and so is grant park the field museum and other main attractions  People from Chicago are great  My jacket fell off my bags when I picked up my checked bags at the hotel and the sent it back to me right away but no without charging my credit card unkowingly   for shipping  The Hotel and everything in it is very pricey  Will go back to Chicago but will not stay there again  
P => Hard Rock Hotel Rocks I just spent the weekend in Chicago at the Hard Rock Hotel  From the moment I arrived I knew I liked the place  The front desk staff was friendly and gave me no problem about checking in a couple of hours early I assume it was because they werent too full  The room was super clean and had the greatest bed I have ever had in a hotel The style of the room was cool with different shades of gray with mirrors everywhere  Although I didnt use it there was a nice sound system with DVDCD changer and internet in the room a really nice touch  There was even a note in the room that you could borrow CDs from the front desk during your stay  My room was on the th floor and our view was obstructed mostly by other buildings but it was neat none the less  The bathroom was unique with a cool image of quotThe Whoquot in it  My wife especially loved the AVEDA soaps and shampoo that were stocked there  I also thought the open air shower with a half glass wall was cool but it did get a little water on the floor because there is no door or curtain  The hotel location was great for us a short walk to shopping or the park  The river is on the next block and several companies had water taxis and tours available  One thing I wanted to do was to get an authentic Chicago Deep Dish pizza  The concierge desk was great in giving us a few choices on Pizza places and directions to walk there  They even got us directions to a popcorn place that was on my wifes quotmust havequot list  I didnt eat or drink in the hotel but the bar looked like someplace I could hang out and relax for a while  There was also a Hard Rock store that didnt impress me or my wife but I wasnt planning to buy anything anyway   Overall we love the Hard Rock Hotel  A four star hotel for about  through Priceline a great deal in my mind  I would definitely go back to the Hard Rock although I probably wont next time since we will have our son with us  The Hard Rock definitely has that adult feel that says quotleave the kids at home quot 
P => Mostly happy with the Hard Rock My girlfriend and I just spent  nights at the Hard Rock in Chicago  I love the Hard Rock in Vegas but not surprisingly the one in Chicago didn t quite have the same excitement  The location on Michigan Ave just south of the river and the Magnificent Mile but near Millennium Park LSD and the Loop worked very well for us  The hotel seems to have been converted from an office building which created some oddities like having to switch elevators to reach the fitness center which is very respectable with TVs on many of the machines  The lobby and bar connect in one large area and though both are spacious and clean they lack the atmosphere of other modern hotels like the W  The room had a great king size bed and a modern feel  The bathroom felt spacious clean and well designed though the shower curtain was flimsy and grabbed onto to my body like a giant wet sock no matter how much I tried to dodge it  Our only complaints related to the service  We encountered two small problems   the drain in the shower had a partial clog and the stereo didn t work  We had to ask the front desk twice to have the drain fixed and three times to fix the stereo which never ended up working  Overall we enjoyed the Hard Rock and we received a great price from Hotwire  
P => Nice Stay and Location my wife and I spent a weekend at the Hard Rock Hotel after getting a ent price online Hotels com  We were given an ADA compliant room which I ordinarily hate but since the room was on a corner with a great view of the river we were pretty pleased  Like most city hotel rooms it was not large but it was extremely comfortable and clean  We did not eat in the hotel as there are too many great options nearby  In fact the hotel is right next door to Mortons and a short walk anywhere else  Very close to the Magnificant Mile Millenium Park Theater District  We would recommend if you can get a ent price online  
P => Perfect Hotel for Us My husband and I took our first trip to Chicago and the Hard Rock Hotel was highly recommended to us by a friend  The front desk personnel were efficient and friendly  When we mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary we were upgraded to a corner room with a river view      nice  Our room on the Annie Lennox floor was quite spacious and quiet but be prepared for low lighting in the rooms  The location is excellent     close to Millenium Park and Magnificent Mile  Eat breakfast at the Corner Bakery just a few blocks north  There is also a convenient bus stop just across the street to get to the city sights not within walking distance  
P => monochromatic or I have just come home from a memorial day weekend adventure in chicago  We chose the hard rock as our place to stay  We wanted the House of Blues hotel but they were booked I must say the hard rock catered to our every need or want but then again we are not a very demanding couple either  We personally liked the or but i can also see how someone could hate it also  We stayed in room  in the tower section and was a studio suite  The room was huge and bath was very nice with its erate bath and shower  We had no problem understanding the minibar situation  You only take out what you want to pay for and leave all the others alone or you might pay for them too  Voss water was  and a pepsi was   Typical  The location was superb  And  I suggest if you want an expensive steak dinner you need to go to Mortons steakhouse which right next door  So yummy  And the service was impeccable  We had Scott serving us and he made it a delight  We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I cannot say what they offer  we ordered a pot of coffee from room service there is a coffee maker in the room so I dont know what my husband was thinking   for that  The lady who brought it was very friendly and courteous  The guys out front were prompt and attentive and the concierge answered all questions we had and gave us discount cards at numerous places we ided to visit  The front desk employees were helpful and nice  So now to the reason for only a four rating  What was that banging noise coming from somewhere in the tower section of the hotel  From the time we checked in on saturday to our checkout on monday it would not go away  granted it didnt bother our sleeping because we were a couple of drinkers that weekend but it might keep someone awake  We asked about it at checkout and it was a shock to them  so be it was only being heard on our floor I will stay here again if the house of blues hotel is booked up again when I go  We just loved our  previous stays at the HOB hotel  Good Luck 
P => ent stay at the Hard Rock Stayed in the Hard Rock for  nights in il   Bargain price of   a night via Priceline which is why it gets  stars  However if I had paid full whack then it would have been rated quotAveragequot Good points Excellent location    minute walk to the Mag Mile and  minute walk to Millennium Park and the theatre district  Very comfortable bed stylish room good entertainment centre  Large bathroom with quality toiletries and picture of John Lennon amp Yoko  Cool Not so good points Staff   a bit hit and miss  Front desk staff generally helpful concierge made us feel like we were bothering him and concierge wasnt there on our first day  Air con   room was quite hot  When we checked in we were told that the hotel uses quotrecirculated air so if you want the room cooler you need to open the windowquot  Really   would never have thought of that myself As mentioned for less than   per night it was very good value for money  Not sure it would be at their usual price Chicago   great city to visit  
P => Disappointing this was my first trip to the USA and I was expecting the world renown service that you always hear about  For a start I was left at the reception for  mins whilst they could not locate my booking and kept insisting that I did not have a reservation  After the long flight and US immigration queues this was not welcome Generally the hotel is loud with lots of parties and we were on the th floor and the traffic noise was disturbing  The room was nice and large but stupid things like no proper lighting in the room let it down  It is in a reasonable location but I wont rush back there again  
P => Loved it Got a great deal through Hotwire for  a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again even at full price  We really liked the rooms muted modern or we had John Lennon and Bono for company  Comfortable bed mini coffe maker plenty storage space and a lovely clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products so I was sold straight away   it doesnt take much I know  If youre a product kie tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies  We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed reception gift shop and bar  The bar area is very trendy I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking   the lack of memorabilia didnt bother me but I was more interested in the art o features of the building itself anyway  The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a quotfriendly lady looking for businessquot when he was at the bar  I think its a place you will either love or hate if you like laid back contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you 
P => No Complaints My best friend and I stayed at the Hard Rock for  nights in ch   We flew in from California at noon and we stopped by the hotel to have them store our luggage until check in which is at  p m  We were very pleased when they allowed us to check in upon arrival at  p m  We were informed right away about the censored mini bar by the front desk  Our room  was spacious enough for the two of us and our belongings   the bed was also pretty comfortable  The hotel itself has a modern touch to it   Like other reviewers mentioned the bar downstairs drew a good crowd even though the drinks were a bit pricy  The bellmen and valet workers were always pleasant and greeted us each time we saw them   Being in our twenties and from the west coast we were very interested in Chicagos nightlife   The workers recommended some great places for us to check out   The location of the hotel is excellent   it is so close to Millenium Park and literally around the corner from the Chicago River   Just a short stroll down Michigan Avenue are all the stores and malls  Walgreens drug store is also directly across the street which was great for me because I was developing a cold and was able to buy medicine right away  Also another bonus was the free high speed internet  I had files that I had to work on so it was very convenient to have unlimited access on the web through my laptop  The Hard Rock Hotel also has a business center on the third floor where you could opt to work if you dont want to work in your room  All you have to do is use your room key to get in   I was able to take the elevator down real quick to use the printer in the business center to print out my boarding pass for free  Very convenient I am going back to Chicago in the summer and I am definitely booking another stay at the Hard Rock  No complaints at all    
P => Not so rockin  My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Chicago  Having stayed at the one in Orlando on several ocassions we had some reasonable expectations as what to expect  THESE  HOTELS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT THE NAME  The hotel lobby is smallish and very dark  or unrekable and stark  There is a bar on one end  More on that later  The rooms were modern well appointed but on the small side  We paid about  which is not bad for downtown  The Hard Rock restaurant with all the memorabilia is no where near and we were told is not owned by or affiliated with the hotel  I dont recall seeing ANY restaurant  There is a small gift shop located just off of the lobby  Before we went out for dinner my husband and I went down to the bar for cocktails and people watching  The drinks were pretty pricey and not very good  As for quotpeople watchingquot it was too dark I think I know the atmosphere they are going for minimalist hipster dark and if this is what you are looking for it pays off in spades  I guess the Hard Rock Chicago just wasnt for us  
P => Very Nice Stay My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock for a get away weekend and had a great experience  The valet parking worked out great and the quotinoutquot privilage is nice  You have the option of them getting your car anytime you want and youll still only pay the flat  per day  Staff was very friendly and helpful my only complaint is that we felt the concierge couldve been a little more pleasant  We had an issue with our bill at the end of the stay and the front desk was very helpful and quick to resolve the problem  I know someone mentioned it in an earlier review but be very careful about the wet barsnacks  There are sensors that monitor the drinks and food and if anything at all is moved they will charge it to your room  I knew that going into the stay since I had already read about it but the front desk explained the details as well when we checked in  Overall we had a wonderful time and I will definitely consider the Hard Rock for our next visit 
P => Hotel did not live up to our expectations My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for one night in ruary and were not impressed  We have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando on three occasions and thought it was really nice  The Chicago location doesnt come close to Orlando  The or is very bleak    blacks greys chrome and very gloomy hallways  As mentioned before in other reviews I counted only one item of music memorabelia on our floor  The set up for the lounge is very confusing  Misc chairs line the hallway by the reservation desk and a small bar is available for drinks  Not a cozy comfortable area at all  We ended up ordering a drink and taking it back to our room  Breakfast at the hotel was OK however quite expensive  Very slow service did not make it much better There are so many really nice hotels to stay at in Chicago so consider other options before booking at this hotel  
P => Nice hotel but too many problems I will say that the Hard Rock Hotel is in a good location and that the rooms are very modern but thats all the good I can say about it  The service we received was horrible  We arrived at about  am on Friday morning  Our reservations were not for later that day  The lady at the front desk would not let us check in early nor would she prorate the rate  Ive stayed at the riott in NY and they were more than glad to accommodate us  We had one room that we got thru priceline at a discounted price and the other room at the regular rate  She said she would honor the priceline rate for the additional night  When we got the invoice a day earlier than we were suppose to we were charged the regular rate  When we went to resolve the issue w the front desk they said that they couldnt honor that rate although thats what we were told but that they would give us complementary champagne for the miscommunication  We were charged for the champagne and had to complain once again to get it removed  It was just a lot of hassle  The staff does not communicate with one other and if they had we would not have had all these problems  I will not be staying at the Hard Rock again  There are other hotels in the area that are just as nice and offer better service  
P => Great Chicago hotel My boyfriend and I are Chicagoans who just wanted a romantic night in the city  We chose the Hard Rock due to a great deal  The location is wonderful convenient to public transportation close to the lake and river water views in several rooms convenient for shopping and nightlife downstairs bar is very chic and easy to walk around the city  The rooms are accomodating and the beds provide a great nights sleep Be warned that the mini bar is sensored and anything that moves in it will automatically be billed to your account  We chilled our own wine in the sink with ice  
P => Eh  Its alright  I booked a room at the Hard Rock because of its location husband and friend were running the athon and I found a good deal on their website it was called the quotuncensored packagequot which included breakfast every morn  and a quotmysterious brown boxquot   whatever that meant  I was a little reluctant to book here but figured Id be prepared because of all the mixed reviews I had read on trip advisor  So because we reserved so early we knew rooms would be limited in the area because of the run I called every two months to make sure we had our reservation  Each time I called a pleasant person answered and confirmed registration and package  I even got them to assign a hotel room in advance Rm and give me an earlier check in time and I confirmed it over and over  We came into Chicago took the quotLquot and checked in with the front desk  no problem but no one knew what the quotuncensored packagequot was  Its not like we really cared we just wanted the breakfast They said they would call up and let us know  Never called  I went downstairs and talked to them again  the people there said there was no such thing as the quotuncensored packagequot and they would call up to let me know what they found out  Never called  At that point I didnt really care to keep calling because we had stuff to do with the athon and quite frankly thats not MY job We had a small clean room  Good view of N  Michigan street  Large bathroom with a tubshower Aveda bathroom supplies and plenty of fluffy bathrobes and towels  Beds were really great and it was generally quiet up there those were the key things the runners needed  The bar downstairs was a good place to end up after a night even though the bartenders act too hip for you  The doormen were the best What crackups The internet access in the business center was free  It was always open and there was no one around  it just cost money to print off their computers  The room service people would forget toilet paper of all things and I would have to call and ask for it  Concierge service was a joke  they tried to set things up for us boat arch  tour and didnt do it right and offered no options we called and booked on our own  Fridge in room wouldnt dispense things  called to get it fixed  It was fixed electronically and I ate a few things out of it and they didnt charge us on our bill  On the last day we got the bill and lo and behold it listed the quotUncensored Packagequot with my room rate I was so mad and called the front desk and wanted to know why they essentially lied and didnt follow up with me about this  No explanations  I finally said quotWell at least I want breakfast ONE of these daysquot They said no problem  I called room service and had a GREAT meal delivered up  Room service tried to give me the bill but I told them that the front desk was taking care of it  I should have just done that every morning now that I think about it  So all in all the hotel really doesnt live up to the hype and its way over priced for pretty crappy service and small rooms  The little things are nice products bed view if youre lucky but it just doesnt seem to cover the lazy inexperienced and ridiculously pretentious service that comes with this hotel  I just dont know how this place has managed to get away with this for so long  Ive never seen a hotel where the reviews are so mixed and vary wildly one way or another  Hotel services should be consistent not based on whether someone is having a bad day or theyre new  I just dont get this place  
P => Doesnt quite live up to expectations     I had high hopes for this hotel but it doesnt quite live up to it The start wasnt great  Upon entering my room I found the the previous guest hadnt left yet A bad error and a major security risk  Anyway I was quickly provided with another room  The room was a little on the small side but comfortable with a great bed  However it really lacked any real magic apart from a few music related pictures The Hard Rock theme is continued throughout the hotel but it seems half hearted there was nothing on my floor   st They lobby is cool and they did arrange a Madonna listening party but overall it lacks a certain edge to make it stand out from the crowd That said its a perfectly acceptable hotel with good service and great beds  
P => Hard Rock Anniversary We went to Chicago for our st anniversary and had a wonderful stay at the Hard Rock Hotel  The beds are excellent The room was clean and very well maintained throughout our stay  The atmosphere is very contemporary which was the opposite of what we normally experience but it was fun to try something new  The one drawback was the lobby turned lounge in the evenings  It is a hang out spot for yuppies and lots of partying and making out is going on  We avoided this by using the side entrance on Michigan Avenue when entering and exiting the hotel in the evenings  The staff was helpful and courteous  Located on the Magnificent Mile with access to some of Chicagos wonderful sights wed definitely stay there again  
P => Rock on     This is a great hotel in a great location in a great city Theres a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rockers in the bathroom     I had the Beatles and although theyre not my cup of tea I was happy enough with George staring back   meThe hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants     try the quotCheesecake Factoryquot or have a meal  cocktail on the top floor of the quotJohn Hancock Centrequot A slighty longer walk or a short cab ride and youre at the quotNavy Pierquot   take a ride on the quotSeadogquot then enjoy all the fun of the fair     or be a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music  This hotel amp city is WELL worth checking out  
P => The Worst Hotel in Chicago Went there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker Drive was recommended  I was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived  hour before me When she go there at PM the room wasnt ready the phone didnt work the shower didnt work  When I got there she was already very upset  I called the manager to complain but was put on hold for  min  I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasnt any wall arating us  I asked for a wake up call but nobody called me the next morning  When I called to complain the next day the told me the phone system was down Ordered room service and got the wrong order   The building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath   I would not recommend it to anyonePatrick 
P => Pretty cool good location interesting model    I agree with the previous reviewer the Hard Rock Chicago isnt perfect  However I stay very frequently at the typical corporate hotels riott Hyatt etc and the Hard Rock is a refreshing change of pace  Its funky fun different and a bit offbeat  First note the hotel is really a Sol Melia hotel branded as Hard Rock  The branding works   but its a Sol Melia hotel with HRC service style featured  Reminds me of most European style including warm rooms on hot summer days  The Lobby and Bar area are cool and it sports an Asian inspired restaurant that is very pricy but with a very interesting menu   many selections are available via room service  The location is excellent   right on Michigan Avenue and quick access to the Magnificent Mile  A Starbucks is at the end of the block if you are so inclined  For the price they should have turn down service   although the morning paper was silently delivered by  am  The Fitness Center looks good but has not been well maintained   and I suspect will continue to line  Overall if you are looking for something with a Maginficent Mile adress that is different and fun   this is a good comfortable the beds are super giant bath towels and quality bath amenities place  
P => the Hard Rock ROCKS DONT believe anything bad you  hear about this hotel We travel quite a bit and this hotel was absolutely fabulous  The lobby is sexy chic and trendy  It offers a nice bar that is open until  am The staff go out of their way to make sure that you have everything you need  In fact on the second day we got a call from the quotanything you wantquot line asking if we needed anything  The rooms are really modern and have great or  Beds are nice and comfy with fluffy pillows and covers Some great perks Each room has a disc changer and dvd player and the concierge has a ton of great CDs that you can borrow for free   The location could not be better We happened to go during a Taste of Chicago which was a three minute walk  And there is a restaurant called Giordanos a block away that has the best stuffed pizza i have ever tasted  Even though the regular rooms are great we ided to upgrade to a suite after the second day  For  more a night we got a FANTASTIC room on the rd floor with the most beautiful view of the city you could ever imagine We had such a wonderful experience at this Hotel that i HAD to write this review for them  Thank you so much for making our trip so memorable  NicoleDallas Texas 
P => Great Location but very dark The Hard Rock is situated on Mich Avenue   within walking distance to shopping restaurants the parks and the museum  The hotel staff is friendly   concierge is very helpful christopher was great  DRAWBACKS hotel is dark poor lighting minimal or no room for suitcases or to unpack they offer two tiny drawers and the hotel is stingy with bathroomin room amenities  All in all it was a enjoyable stay   but did not meet expectations for night 
P => A trendy and comfortable hotel in a great location I stayed at the Hard Rock in uary and ch   I was impressed by the friendly and knowledgable staff and the hotel location  On both occaions I stayed in a deluxe room which is quite large and has everything I needed to make my stay both productive and comfortable  On my first trip I had a few problems with Internet access which their helpdesk resolved immediately  On the second trip I had a slight delay checking in  mins or so and they offered me a different room with a wonderful view of N Mighigan Ave and the river  The rooms are slightly dark in the evenings as the lighting is ambient  This is not such an issue during the day as there is plenty of natural light from several windows  The bar downstairs is always busy and has a lively atmosphere  One of the other reviews mentioned noise and I must say that I didnt notice any noise during either of my visits  The furnishing in the rooms gives a great contemporary feel and the guitars and clothes of various rock stars on each floor is a nice touch  I would recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there again when I visit  
P => Great hotel for the Young and Trendy Want to have fun Want to stay in a Trendy Place Want a great serviceThen this is your place  I have stayed in several Chicago Locations House of Blues Double Tree riot but at Hard Rock is where the action is The Base is a great bar it get real busy with very nice people  The Manager James is a great dude Great location splendid hotel great staff lot of action  
P => Great Hotel in a Great City to get around We planned our last trip to Chicago around the famed quotTaste of Chicagoquot and the th of y celebration  The Hard Rock Hotel on Michigan Avenue was a welcome comfortable place to be with kids traveling away from home  The adults were happy with the facility big spacious rooms great sized bathrooms for moving our team around even umbrellas at the front desk when the rain hit and a very courteous and knowledgeable staff for our miriad of questions  The kids loved the views of city life orations food and how quickly we got to our various adventures  Ease of access to quotThe Tastequot shopping night spots and all things downtown made for a delightful experience over the week before and after th of y  Commuting to the rest of the city was within a few blocks of any train line or short bus trip  We look forward to our next trips during the holiday travel and a definite stop for next summer in Chicago 
P => Hard Rock Hotel Chicago A Great Place to Stay We have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago several times and it is a great place  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful  The building and the rooms are immaculate and beautifully furnished  It is located right where you want to be and I would recommend this hotel to all business and vacation travellers 
P => Great I stayed in one of the tower suites this past uary  What a wonderful treat it was  The suite has  degree views looking up and down Michigan Avenue with views of Millenium Park the river and Lake Michigan  All of the amenities are first class and well thought out  The or while having a rockn rollhip element are contempory and very comfortable  The service is excellent  
P => chicagos desperado destination I recently arrived to the BOLD new michigan avenue hotel destination namely hard rock hotel and found the experience immediately hip atmospherically relaxing with simple undertones of elegance a mindful valet amp baggage handler desk staff aimed to pleased a vastly knowledgable concierge rooms that environmentally shifted your mindset from work to pleasure and a barrestaurant with healthy and edging cuisine choices     all in all     your stay will play as a favorite song I highly recommend this hotel and experience RespectfullyMJS 
P => Power Spot I recently visited the Hard Rock Chicago for the first time  I was with a group of  middle aged fun loving women and we were treated like royalty from the moment we were welcomed by the door staff until the concierge walked us to our car  days later  The place is hot fun and happening   it is palpable when you enter the lobby  Lots of locals in the lobby bar great location on Miracle Mile outstanding restaurant on premesis staff that is friendly funny and determined to assist you in any way they can  Our room was compact but larger rooms are available  The bathrooms are fun We loved it so much that we are going back next month when we see U   should be a blast  Extra plus   without a doubt the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on in a long time  
P => Loved the Hard Rock Hotel This hotel is a vacation in itself with the views very cool and modern rooms and a bar right in the lobby  But if you can manage to leave the hotel its close to everything 
P => Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense day after Thanksgiving shopping  It really is a great hotel  The rooms are really cool and we were just in the basic one  The bed is extremely comfortable with the softest sheets and great pillows  The technology in the room is great  They have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms  For a very modern room it is still comfortable and homey The location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go  The staff were very nice and helpful  The bar is really funky with an interesting tini menu  One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago  Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend  
P => Hell of a Hard Rock I have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago IL recently and have been thrilled with the product amp service  The rooms have all the amenities including a full stereo flat screen TV great bed and better towels  The staff is great and the base bar is even better  Its a hot local scene with a good mix of clients  
P => Great value and great electronics Okay so the rooms are very modern  What was important to me was that the mattress is outstanding and so is the TV and stereo system  This is the place for audiophiles It is probably a little too sleek and trendy for some    it is the quotHard Rockquot afterall  Service is outstanding  Room service would bring me anything reasonable that I wanted cooked  They have a steak salad that is delicious  Ive stayed in a number of different rooms and one week that I stayed here I ended up being stuck in the room sick    the hotel staff brought me stuff from the drug store and called to check how I was doing  How can anyone say that it isnt a warm place Its the people who make a place warm and welcoming Moreover I travel to Chicago a lot and this is one of the best hotels around for comfort service and value  The rooms  not be to some peoples taste in terms of or but it isnt suppose to be your home    only a place to sleep at night  I like the fans in the rooms because they can be used to drown out outside noise or you can turn them off if you find them annoying  I think this is a wonderful hotel and if you dont like the grey order some nice colorful flowers to compensate 
P => Confused useless staff My then fiance and I stayed at the Hard Rock a few days before we took off to our wedding location  We had spent the day at Six Flags in Gurnee and arrived frazzled and exhausted  The snotty staff checked us in and we were up to our room  I stuck the key in the door and it opened but was bolted with the chain lock   there was someone in the room We went back to the front desk and got another key  The room was nice and very comfortable but very very small  So small that it is hard to close the bathroom door without standing in the bathtub Mini bar prices were rediculous as were the room service charges  Parking was rediculous    a day and you cannot access it without a valet  The second day we returned to find that our room key didnt work anymore   again went to the desk and got a new key  All in all it looks like a lovely hotel wonderfuly comfortable beds and nicely orated   just a bit overpriced full of yuppies and has a terrible staff  
P => An Excellent Place to Stay in Chicago I was nervous about our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel after reading the posts but we had a wonderful stay at the Hard Rock and I definitely would stay there again  We arrived on   st with our  and  year old sons the night at Hard Rock was my younger sons birthday present  I was afraid the place would be full of partyers left over from New Years Eve but the place thankfully was clean calm and quiet  EVERY employee from valet to registration to the concierge to the store to housekeeping greeted us and bent over backwards to please us  My son is a big Kiss fan and the concierge slipped a note under our door while we were at dinner to inform us which floor of the hotel had the Kiss memorabilia  The Hard Rock is in an ideal location within walking distance to State Street theaters and MagMile shopping  We ate at Italian Village on Monroe West Egg on Ontario and shopped at Water Tower Place without the need of a cab  As far as the person complaining about the rate during the Chicago athon all of the hotels hike up the rates for that weekend and as a Chicago athon runner myself I know to expect that The shower was hot and the towels HUGE  The beds were really comfy  We even had a bit of a view of the Chicago River from our th floor room  
P => Average Very nice reation of Carbide and Carbon Building  Rooms are tastefully orated and the building is well kept  Service however seemed to be hit or miss  The doormen were pretty lousy always seemed preoccupied or too busy having fun and carrying on with other employees  Also a very very mixed clientele  Everything from well heeled  year old couples to shady looking young folks  
P => Not Worth The Money My wife and I stayed at the Hotel during for the Chicago athon  I am sure they took complete advantage of that based on the outrageous prices they charged for that weekend   a night plus  in taxes The hotel lobby was gothic looking and if the mortuary feel is what you are looking for then this is the place for you If you want a great place to stay close to the quotGolden Milequot stay at the Talbott Hotel      its the best kept secret in Chicago  
P => Hot water is important My husband and I stayed here on the th floor  We consistently had problems with hot water in the shower  We had to run the water for a good ten minutes and then got very little water pressure and lukewarm water at best to take a shower  We also had issues with room service  We ordered a pot of coffee which took  minutes to arrive at which point the coffee was tepid  When we called to complain and request another pot of coffee it never arrived at all  Also the minibar had no water bottles and none were provided at turn down either  The hotel has a great location and the rooms and lobby are nicely designed yet with a somewhat cold minimalist vibe  There are many other better options in this great city  
P => Great place   great location I stayed at the Hard Rock last week the first week of     I checked in early which was no problem as I think I had the entire floor to myself The room itself was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable  The bathroom was ent not good enough lighting and the tub seemed a little dirty  The location cant be beat   I was taking a class about a half mile away and walked each day  I shopped on the Magnificent Mile and down State Street   all within walking distance  The art museum Milennium Park and tons of fabulous restaurants are all within a  minute walk or short cab ride Service was good   the concierge recommended the BEST Chicago style pizza I have ever had  I had room service one night and thought it was reasonably priced and very tasty  Their restaurant had just opened but I lined to try it after seeing the limited menu selections and high prices about  per entree  I never got to the bar but I did enjoy the business center as I didnt have a laptop Would I stay here again Definitely  As long as I could get a good rate  This hotel  be worth     a night but certainly not     
P => Just okay Very contemporary and trendy place but it was expensive and didnt have many amenities  The breakfast buffet was    per person and the drinks at the bar were    each  We were disappointed that there wasnt any pool or hot tub  At night the lobby turns into a night club full of rich people who drive sports cars  I guess they are the only ones who can afford the drinks  The room was entirely gray   gray walls gray bedspread gray tv  But everything was clean and the employees were nice  Also the location was great  
P => Wow What a great hotel  Everything worked as should  A constant party atmosphere  Sheer pleasure  Simply the best  Bravo 
P => Hard Rock Chicago Really Rocks What a place this is My wife and I stayed there for Valentines Day last year and had a wonferful time  The rooms are nicely orated and the beds are very comfortable  The hotel provides a bathrobe to slip into amp unwind after a long day of fun in the Windy City The flat panel tv is a plus right along w the DVD player and the surround system in the room  Loved the lighting in the room because you can keep it dark amp romantic or just turn on the lights for some reading  The lobby itself was a fun place for the ambiance amp music  Very modern hotel within a landk building  Great Michigan Avenue location close to shopping dining theaters river tours and about  minutes away from Navy Pier  Really consider this place next time you stay in Chicago  
P => Loved this hotel We loved this hotel  Best room I have ever stayed at  The rooms were the best  The room service is done twice a day with new towels being brought each time and the beds being turned down each night with hard rock robes waiting for you Very comfortable bed and feather pillows  I could not have asked for a better hotel  We were welcomed back everytime by the staff Great Location   I give this hotel an A  
P => Loved the Hard Rock I loved the Hard Rock Other reviewers indicated that the service was horrible and snotty that the rooms were dark and dirty and that they did not like the hotel  However my husband and I had a completely opposite experience on both of our stays at the hotel  We found the service to be professional and the rooms were clean and trendy  We try to only stay at boutiquetrendy hotels during our travels and enjoyed the Hard Rock so much during our first stay that we booked another room three weeks later  The Base Bar is a hip place to hang out and have a drink and the hotels location cannot be beat This is a hotel I would definitly reocmmend  Also the bed is amazing and the bathrooms with the glass enclosed showers are great My only complaint is that I wish the bath products were a little more high end but the sea salt soap was nice  Finally I really liked the availability of  hour room service  
P => Dark and boring The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago does not meet up to its sister properties throught the US  Their is no parking available only a valet who is not accesible due to traffic and congestion  It is so dark when you enter the lobby  it immediately depresses you  The Base Bar is tiny absolutely no room to have a crowd drinks are overpriced The best thing about the hotel is the bedBed and bedding are perfect most comfortable bed ever The staff is not friendly and imitates that they are better than the rest of the crowd very quotHollywoodishquot If that is such a thing Their seemed to be a constant party on our floor and kept us up all night long security was called twice and then we gave up  I am up for partying anytime but sometimes you need to have respect for where you are I would not stay here again and would not recommend it either 
P => The Hard Rock Tested My Mettle I have stayed in the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel and absolutely loved it  However the Second City version is definitely second rate  For starters the dark furniture and chrome fixtures are depressing  Plus why would you have Kiss serve as an icon for the Chicago hotel What about some area musiciansIn addition to the dour surroundings I found the service to be very subpar here  I waited by the bar for ten minutes until the barkeeps finished their personal conversation and were FINALLY able to serve me an overpriced and poorly mixed drink They touted the fact that the bar was open until am   probably hoping that people would be drunk enough to overlook the service In the rather untidy room the Hard Rock advertised that you could get free DVDs and watch a flick in the nice Sony DVD player  However when we called we were told that this service was not unavailable  Why did they still have the in room information playing up the perkI woke up to find a rather menacing looking spider in the shower  Does this go with the quotKissquot theme or is this another way that they are trying to quotrock our worldquot  the rather annoying catchphrase uttered by all the desk personnelAll in all the Hard Rock was overpriced overhyped with lackluster service and dark and depressing surroundings  The location is great but the wonderful quotMonacoquot hotel is just around the corner 
P => Will stay here again Stayed here one night with a group of  for bachelor party night out on the town  Could not have been happier with our choice of hotel  The location was excellent the place was very clean and the rooms were suprisingly bigger than what I thought they would be  Overall the staff was friendly and professional although the wait for our car from parking did take at least  minutes  And  for parking with inout privileges is a pretty good deal if your driving all the way downtown  Word of advice if you are driving use Wacker instead of Michigan The hotel filled all my expectations and earned some repeat business  
P => Front Desk Staff is Rude My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel and found the hard rock had lost our reservation  I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone  The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying  It wasn t until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally ided that she would research the issue  Ten minuets later she found our reservation  Our room wasn t ready we were told that it would be ready at noon we came back at  and were told it was still dirty Room was very small  The bathroom shower sink and floor were filthy  Room service trays sit in the hallways all day  The next morning we called down to get towels they were never brought to the room we had to drip dry  The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher  He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub  
P => behind the velvet ropes Me and my Dad went up to the city for a weekend  I had bought him tickets to see the Blue Men Group   which is an excellent show by the way  I think we payed   a night for two night and what we got was a   i night hotel and service  Not a deal and not a rip off  Ill start with the so so and finish with the amazing  The rooms were a bit small but not bad for two people  Four people would have been pushing it  The service was very good but some of the people did have a bit of an attude must be a chicago thing The base bar is a cool place to have A drink at   per pop there are much cooler places to go in the city  Now the amazing  The or the or the or  Very cool and very sleek  The rooms come with a free compulation CD and a great quothotelquot Sound system  Something I think alot of hotels overlook  The most amazing part of the Hard rock is the Concierge  This guy is CONNECTED  Ask for Christphor Me and my father wanted to one of the hottest night clubs in the city so we ask him about it  He dircetd us to the Funky Budda Room  When we got there there were two lines  One for the people on the list which was an hour line and one four the people not on the list which was an  hour line  Before we had left hard rock we Chis had given us his card and written some thing on it  He told us to give this to the door man and it would get us in faster  So my dad got into the list line and we waited there for a while then I though I would talk to the door man and see if the card would get us in any faster  When I should the door man the card and told him who I was staying at the hard rock  He aploygied personal to me and my father for making us wait did not make us pay the   each cover and best of all lind when we insisted on tipping him for getting us in so fast  The night before we wanted to go to a blues bar  Me and my dad figued we would just go with one of those mainstreem advertised ones but when we ran this past chris he nearly rolled over in his grave and quickly followed up with discouted pass to some local place which was again amazing  I could give more examples but I only have so much time  All in all this place is worth staying at once but with so many amazing hotels in this city I never stay at the same place twice  If you like this hotel try out hotel  on wacker great place as well  
P => Rock On We loved our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago Great location beautiful and fun or especially loved having Sting in our bathroom very friendly staff from the valet parking guys who whisked our bags out of the car for us to the front desk staff to the security staff who greeted us in the foyer to the housekeepers to the room service folks     The bartenders were somewhat aloof but thats okay   I dont like to be hovered over  Everything was impeccably clean and the bed was the most comfortable Ive ever slept in Other reviewers have complained about the lack of view but hey step outside and get all the view you want  Drinks at the bar were pricey but that seems par for the course for a big city hotel bar  Were already talking about spending our vacation there next year 
P => Cool Hotel

P => Still one of the best values in chicago Heart of Chicago continues to be a great little inexpensive place to rest for a trip to chitown  Just steps to Clark St  to catch a bus or a min walk to the EL stop Bryn Which over the years has become a less scary area  I would still hesitate to walk it alone at night but with a group of friends I dont think its an issue  The motel is located just off Clark St  directly between Andersonville and Rogers Park  Andersonville in the yrs Ive been staying at HOC has become a vibrant diverse mecca of old timer Sweedish and more recently arrived gay and DINKy types  The neighbord is clean well lit and full of things to do and eat  Right at the point where Ashland meets Clark there is a Mexican Bakery that is just awsome  Just south on Clark is Sweedish Bakery and the famous Ann Sather is just a block or so further south on Clark  Inbetween are an array of sushi mediterranian latin american and american places to pick from to eat and a wonderful potpouri of shops  The Heart of Chicago staff is for the most part wonderfully friendly and helpful  Don in the evenings and Javed on day shift are always ready to give advise on where or how to get somewhere   If they dont know they will usually find the answer  There is a relatively recent arrival  A younger lady who needs to work on her customer service skills and demeanor a bit  She comes of curt and gives the impression she really would rather be somewhere else  Hopefully that can be taken care of by management  Not something that some corrective guidance couldnt solve very easily  That said I will continue to come back  I had read other complaints here about inconsistent internet service    There are outdoor routers and  bands to get the wirless but connection was spotty at best  This needs to be corrected    I If I had needed to do business work in the romm I would have been very upset   
P => Clean pleasurable place  Love the Heart We booked a week straight at the end of e  thru hotels com me and my girlfriend on a month long trip all over the U S First of all the POSITION  It is located in good Andersonville near one of Chicagos best places to see Wrigleyville  Safe place with lots of young people elder women friendly faces  And the more you get close to the Wrigley Field the more the places look cool  The complaints about its location and how long it is to get to transports are exaggerated in my opinion  Just outside the motel you have the bus that takes you in less than  minutes seriously to the EL stop quotBryn Mawrquot or directly to Wrigleyville  Mind that with the cheap CTA card you can take bus and metro as much as you want at no charge  As for the distance between Bryn Mawr and the Heart id like to point out that the taxi we took upon arrival not knowing the actual distance from the motel just a straight road took us around the neighborhood for a while just to build up on fares   jackaxxs  be its the reason why some people complaint so much about the distance THE ROOM was superclean the kind of cleaniness that makes you come back tired after a day of sightseeing make a shower and go around the room barefeet  Not bad  The free continental BREAKFAST was another welcome feature  Lots of tasty donuts fruit oatmeals good coffee and juice  Were italians and wanted exactly this type of food in the morning just to start you up  GoodThe latin woman at the front desk is rather unpolite not very gentle  But who cares i mean in a motel you dont need that much of interaction anyway And at the front desk you could also meet the chicagoan guy I dont know if he runs the motel himself or he just works there but he was really polite and willing to help you  He showed us bus stops gave us tips on directions and was just a pleasant local to talk to  Kind enough we wanted to say goodbye upon leaving All in all we had a great experience at the heart Definitely a place to look for if youre travelling on a budget Chicago hotels can be expensive and want a very clean safe place to crash after a day around  The fact that this review sounds like a pamphlet from the motel should tell you a lot about the experience 
P => So so Not bad    you get what you pay for  After a long day of touring the El stop is a bit of a walk  Front desk staff were the worst I have encountered in a long time however  Very s interiors  
P => Great Location for Wrigley Half the price of any other place near Wrigley Great s neon sign  Free parkingNo frills older motel  Stayed for two nights while attending a ball game   would not hesitate to stay again  Clean and comfortable  Loved the pinkish bath fixtures  TV channels were just the locals including WGN with the digital conversion  On a major street with a fire station nearby so not very quiet ac helped dampen the noise We took the bus to the game and walked back to the motel  mi  Some nice side streets to run on  This motel was less than half of the price of a couple more places close to the ballpark  I 
P => Value for money   would use again Elderly Motel on a fairly busy ction in the northern part of Chicago  We used it as a base for a  day visit to Chicago and found using the public transport USD for a week ticket very cost effective  We used the trains and the buses it would take us about  minutes to get into the main city  A  minute walk took you to the nearest train station and another  or so to get to the nearest beach  The area just south of the Motel about a   minute walk provides a great selection of places to eat  It felt very safe throughout the area the whole time we spent there  The Motel itself is showing signs of age but was clean and comfortable  Main negatives were the choice of the noisy air conditioner or the noise of the traffic overnight  
P => Lovethis gem in Andersonville Great location in Andersonville if you have a car  Free parking and Ann Sathers and fabulous stores like Scout Brownstone Antiques Urbant Brown Elephant ect few driving blocks down Clark Street  Very basic but does a movie channel and very clean   no smell no bugs could eat off bathroon floors  I have stayed here many many times on personal and business  Never been disappointed  I was in a noisy room once heater made noise but they gladly switched me to a different room   no noise no problem  I always bring a smal fan to drown out hotelstreet noise no matter where I travel  But if have a car very easy ride to Chicago on LakeShore Drive and again fabulous Andersonville  
P => Excellent cheap option Arriving in chacago late on a saturday night thought we would get a hostel to keep it a cheap trip but these fill up quickly in chicago  We stumbled across this as beers were the top of the agenda very good value at  and male receptionist was extremely pleasant and receptive  very helpful when we explained what we were looking for in Chicago and a font of information  One of the best motel signs ive seen  A quaint little pub across the road worth one morning breakfast was basic but included cereal pastries muffins fruit teas coffee and plenty of it As much as you can carry if your on a budget  
P => Great value for the location in Andersonville ided to stay here due to its proximity to a concert venue  We my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised with the motel and the neighborhood  The parking was abundant and relatively secure  The free continental breakfast was unexpected and wasnt bad apples bananas coffee orange juice milk cereal donuts and some porridge type stuff  Being that the motel is located in Chicago the traffic on the street N Ridge was constant and noisy at times  Bring earplugs or crank up the heaterAC for some white noise  The rooms were fine  Reading a previous critique of the motel you  want to keep in mind that loose change on a table or nightstand is a common method of tipping housekeeping  If you dont intend to tip keep your change out of sight  Thats common motelhotel sense If you are looking to eat or shop the next southerly street  block on N Ridge is N Clark  Head south right and there are plenty of restaurants coffee shops kets and shops within walking distance  For cheap mexican tacos cheak out the taqueria in the back of the Aguilas America ket at  N Clark street  Yummy and cheap     each and made before your eyes  Not sure about public transportation  There were plenty of buses and taxis outside the motel though  Last thing book direct with the motel   its cheaper  Have fun  
P => Good Motel  Great Price  Nice Neighborhood   Amazing Trip For the price the Heart of Chicago is an OUTSTANDING motel  Any complaints I might have    noisy AC slightly cramped shower    are so small that they are far outweighed by the positives In a neighborhood where home properties are going for  to   million finding a motel for  a night is amazingThe motel lies in the northern part of the Andersonville neighborhood which is undergoing a revival at the moment  Its a vibrant place populated simultaneously by multi generation families  year old hardware stores and Swedish bakeries alongside new clothing boutiques gourmet bistros and gay amp lesbian book stores  Its a fantastic neighborhood The Heart of Chicago also sits right on the   Peterson bus route which will take you directly to the Bryn Mawr Red Line stop in about five minutes  I bought a  day unlimited use CTA pass and used it constantly  Downtown Wrigley the Navy Pier the Museum Campus OHare and Midway     there isnt anywhere in the city that you cant get to with a CTA passAnd the food Holey moley The motel lies within a short five to  min  walk of Thai Mexican Turkish Swedish Chinese Polish and American restaurants  Theres also a White Castle about  yards from the motel for those late night cravingsLove Chicago  Loved the Heart of Chicago  Please glance at the six photos I included  They should give you a good feel for the motel and Andersonville Nuff said  
P => Thieving Housekeepers The Heart OChicago is a very basic OK located northside Chicago motel at a reasonable price  I was fairly happy with my stay until a large amount of change which added up to a reasonable amount of money was blatantly stolen from my room by housekeeping  I notified management who said it was none of their business and to bring it up with housekeeping myself the next day  What an unbelivably rude and inappropriate attitudeIts not the money itself that bothers me but the fact that housekeeping knows they can get away with violating your personal space by taking what they want from your property because management obviously doesnt care if they do so  I dont care how cheap a motel is this kind of behaviour is just unacceptable  Only stay here if you have everything including your loose change under lock and key andor want to be treated like a sucker  
P => Very good value Very good for the money  Old but very clean  I would stay there again  
P => Great for a budget traveller complete with kitschy sign I used to live in Chicago and always was intrigued by this hotel when I drove by it mostly due to the big cheesy sign which I love  I was back in town to do some work and although I usually stay with friends I ided to get a hotel for a couple of nights  Since I was using my grant money I wanted to save on costs so that I can use the money for other things  I read the reviews on here and ided to give the Heart a try  I was not disappointed I got a large spacious room for less than  a night It is clean has FREE wireless and a free breakfast although the food choices are limited cant complain about the price  As a former resident of the city I can say the location while not ideal for getting downtown is very good especially if you enjoy the neighbourhoods of Chicago rather than the downtown core  Andersonville is within walking distance which is a great neighbourhood  Also the Clark bus   is one block away and this bus will zoom you down to WrigleyvilleLakeviewLincoln Park quite easily or even downtown  Although if youre heading to Michigan Ave I would catch the   to Bryn Mawr station and take the red line downtown  Essentially this is a great deal and you will not be disappointed especially if you like retro things 
P => Nothing Fancy But Good Value Stayed here il th amp th  and felt it was ent value for the money  The towels provided excellent exfoliation whether you wanted it or not and the continental breakfast was pretty sparse but the rooms were clean housekeeping quite adequate good restaurants close by and it was easy to navigate to the Lakeshore and downtown  Free parking too Nothing fancy but for well under  a night great spot 
P => A delightful surprise I work for a major hotel brand and due a large convention in the city for the T Giving weekend I had to find an alternate accomodation  While I must admit a non brand hotel would be my last choice I gave it a shot based on reviews  I must say that I was very impressed  While the rooms are not as modern as most newer hotels I must say that it was exceptionally clean As I work in hotels I did a thorough inspection and did not find a hair dust anything  The housekeeping staff does a great job  Everything worked properly in the room but the only drawback as my TV did not have a remote that is a necessity now days  The heating system was very good  little loud but still great  One thing that really impressed me with this hotel was that as a small hotel they had complimentary WiFi in all of the rooms  This is a great feature most big hotels dont even have this convenience  I will be back in Chicago many times over the next year for pleasure trips and I am going to skip my own brand just for the convenience of this location for my needs and for the comfort and service I received  This hotel while small has definately got a Heart to insure guest comfort 
P => Heart of Chicago   Great Price  We recently spent a weekend in Chicago and through Trip Advisor reviews found the Heart of Chicago Motel  The first attraction was the price  for a one bed double complimentary continental breakfast and FREE parking  What a bargain Our room was clean and comfortable  Due to traffic we arrived at  pm without dinner  We asked the front desk for a nearby restaurant  He told us to go  blocks to Clark St hang a right and go another  blocks  Since we had been in the car all day I asked if it was safe for us to walk over there  No problem this is a residential area  We set off on foot and came across Andersonville a lovely neighborhood area with an eclectic mix of shops ethnic restaurants and bakeries  After some exploring we selected a Thai restaurant for a tasty dinner and great service  We felt totally safe walking around the area and back to our hotel  My husbands weekend seminar was on Lake Shore Drive near Navy Pier  The Heart of Chicago is north of downtown and it was an easy drive to get him to his seminar  For me I skipped downtown shopping and explored Clark St driving south from our hotel towards downtown  I came across many great neighborhood pockets to explore  The only downside to the hotel is that the hotel is on a corner and there is a great deal of traffic going by on the street late into the night  We were aware of it but were still able to get a good nights sleep both nights  A light sleeper might have a problem with it  But then with all the traffic in Chicago I am not sure you can get away from this  We would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to friends  
P => Nice place to stay My husband and I stayed here priily because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and the previous reviews are pretty much right on  I gave this hotel such a high rating because of the value we received Pluses Clean Nice shower and functional bathroom  A roomy place to hang up our clothes  Even though our room was in the front of the hotel we didnt hear much traffic noise  We felt safe at all times  Drapes that block out the light  A good air conditioner and the ability to open the front and bathroom window to get a nice cross breeze  A solid continental breakfast with coffee and juice fruit rolls oatmeal and cereal  Ice machine and microwave near the front office wake up call service free parking  A TV with an adequate amount of channels WiFi service  The guy at the front desk was always really nice  Housekeeping was great best of all they came in the afternoon so we never got bothered by maids wanting to vacuum at  in the morning  The Andersonville neighborhood just south of the motel is fun to explore Access to public transportation there is a  bus that goes downtown a  bus that goes to a metra station and the CTA red line train station is a  minute walk or there is an  bus that goes to that station  Minuses No hair dryer shampoo conditioner or lotion  Just soap  Flat instead of fitted sheets  No alarm clock  be could use a few extra hangers  The furnishings and or are old style and a bit shabby which I have to admit I kind of like the old style or  Somewhat scratchy towels and blankets although the sheets were soft and everything was clean  Wrigley Field is halfway between this hotel and downtown dont take the number  bus from downtown if there is a Cubs game going on On the other hand if you re in town to see a Cubs game this would be a good location  This motel is perfect if youre the kind of traveler that likes cleanliness and value and dont really care about quotluxuryquot type hotels  Thank you all you Tripadvisor reviewers who helped us find a great place to stay 
P => Less  of Sleeping leaves more  for Shopping The internet showed this hotel as being booked so I called them directly  They were able to reserve me a room right away When we got there we were amazed  I thought since the price was so reasonable and it was in a good area that the place would have been a dump  Now I am no princes so fine dinning and fancy chandalers arent my thing  But if you want a room that looks like grandmas guest room thats clean and afordable then stay here The staff is really nice and helpful  There is a cute little country bar accross the street if you want to get trashed and then walk back to your room wout driving  There is a bus stop about  block away that can take you directly downtown or to the CTA   But it is only like  min drive  The airconditioners work good TV with cable and internet  The bathrooms have great shower power and best of all the rooms SMELL CLEAN Free parking in a lot The breakfast is good too Choice of cerial fruit donuts or muffins  They have good coffee too We will be staying there again and again  I thinks its the best place to stay in Chicago for the   I have visited Chicago  times now all in different areas and different hotels 
P => Cheap and Family Friendly Think of an old motor lodge from your childhood and this is it  Clean a bit shabby but Free parking In Chicago  think about that Free continental breakfast included fresh fruit and healthy cereal Good coffee  I had a quiet non smoking room  As a woman traveling alone I felt safe with lots of people staying there and lots of kids  A great bargain 
P => A great place to rest your head and beat the Chicago Hotel Prices My wife and I stayed in the Heart O Chicago Motel so we could look for apartments  It was the perfect place to stay for us simply because it had free wireless internet so we could look for apartments online and a CTA bus stop that is right in front of the motel that takes you directly to the bryn mawr red line stop  There isnt anything special about this place at all other than that it is clean cheap and a safe place to stay  Also the staff was very nice and helpful  The motel offers probably the best continental breakfast that Ive ever had  It consists of dunkin doughnuts otis spunkmeyer muffins orange juice coffee     basically as simple as you can get  We both really enjoyed our time hear and it served its purpose  
P => Nice clean retro Great little place Clean old but nice for the price We will go back Took the Red Line to Addison and the Cubs game and then on to Bryn   There is a bus that runs right by the Motel if you get there before  p m  but they start back up at  am This is how to enjoy Chicago on a budget We stayed to late at the game and walked to the motel  Not too bad of a neighborhood nor too long of a walk  
P => Grateful for previous reviews  This was our first stay in Chicago  When I was looking for hotels the prices were unbelievable and some of the reviews for these high price hotels were worse  I am so thankful for the reviews on Heart OChicago because I was not disappointed  This two night stay was great  The motel is retro  yellow everywhere The breakfast was adequate for us  fresh apples coffee and a gigantic muffin  The bed was comfy and everything was clean  We paid   per night and understand this was a great bargain  We fell in love with Chicago  what a great city  it seems safe and the ride down Lake Shore Drive is priceless  We did the boat tour showing the different buildings and history of Chicago we toured Moody Bible Institute and the Pacific Gardens Mission  The Millenium Park is beautiful  We were very pleased and hope to return someday  
P => Worth the cash For the past five years I have gone to the Taste of Chicago and stayed at this hotel with NO problems  Its nice safe and above all its CLEAN  It offers a simple place for you to rest your head where you dont have to worry about someone breaking into your car at night  The overnight check in is located at the one and only entryexit so they keep an eye on everything going on  Book early the rooms fill up quickly  
P => Cant beat the price We stayed in this motel in y  at the peak of the busy travel season in the US  When we booked the motel we read other Trip Advisor reviews and were expecting a no frills but clean and ent motel at a great price  Thats exactly what we got  I gave it  stars not because of how fabulous it is but because it is a fabulous value  Sure the place is dated and is nothing fancy sure you get a single dougnut for your continental breakfast  But if you would rather save a few bucks and use it for the rest of your trip its well worth a stay at the Heart  One point worth mentioning   Im not so sure this place would have been as convenient if we werent driving a car  It is NOT downtown proper and although there is of course public transportation its not always the most convenient option  Bottom line if we had a car in Chicago next time we visit we would stay here again but if we were on foot we might look elsewhere  
P => Very Retro Very Clean Very Affordable and Very Handicapt Accesible Im a wheelchaired patron and I found this hotel uniquely accessable given its size and age  I have personally written to the ADA commenting on how well they caitered to my needs  The rates were reasonable and the retro atmosphere kept me amused between the nights  
P => Would not recommend We stayed at this MOTEL for  nights ch   We paid   per night  We did not have a car as we flew in and used public transportation bus subway taxi during our stay  If you are using only public transportation and want to leave the hotel I would NOT recommend this MOTEL  We took the bus on the corner and it took a minumum of  up to  and half hours to reach downtown and then back again  Too much time on bus  It is a motel the room you enter from outside of the building  I can not express how loud it is inside the room during sleeping hours  MOTEL is on busy intersection lots of sirens horns and car noises  BRING earplugs  The room is clean cleaned daily friendly staff and donuts and instant coffee offered each morning  We were out a lot at night and didnt have any safety problems  I WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN  
P => What a bargain We read all the reviews in the various websites also found this in Frommers Budget travel magazine Its  miles north of downtown but we were driving so it was perfect for us  Cheap clean and Krispy Kremes for breakfast I had read in a few place that the traffic was noisy so we asked for an upstairs room back in a corner away from the streets so no problems there  Good bargain 
P => My Favorite Chicago Secret I hesitate to even write a review of the Heart O Chicago because I dont want anyone else to know about it Ive stayed there at least a couple times a year for the past  years  The motel is very basic but it is ently maintained clean and the staff are friendly and even remembered my name after a years absenceWhile I would prefer to stay directly in Boystown the prices and availability there are ridiculous   so I remain at the Heart And dont forget El Norte is only a short  minute walk away and is open  hours on Friday and Saturday It is a safe neighborhood that I have never hesitated to walk or bike through   and the Lakeshore bike path is only a  minute thrilling street ride away 
P => Love the Heart It is a motel but it is clean and the help is very friendly so I give it an above average rating  We stay there everytime we go to Chicago  We would rather spend our money on food and fun than an overpriced room in Downtown Chicago  
P => Great value Excellent value did not feel unsafe in the area at all  Bus   runs downtown hrs and takes around  minutes  Free coffee and donuts for breakfast rooms are clean and well kept  
P => clean comfortable motel on a noisy corner Bring earplugs Also if you are the least bit sensitive to cigarette smoke try to inspect a room before you pay for one  You might find an ashtray in your quotnon smokingquot room  Bearing this in mind the motel is night and is not in a bad neighborhood  Beds are soft and very comfortable  The place is a small s retro motor inn but is very lovingly kept up  They were repainting below the outside windows the last time I visited  Rooms have the or of grandmas quotrec roomquot but the place is a bargain for the price  The parking lot provides a nice echo chamber which amplifies the sound of cars trucks and assorted horns and sirens  But again a pair of earplugs will make everything quiet  
P => Beat it Unless they move this place about  miles south they should change the name  I am a white male and felt out of place uncomfortable and not safe in this neighborhood  There is a White Castle practically next door  The walk to the el is about a quarter of a mile through a seedy rundown part of town  I wouldnt even think of staying here again  
P => Best value in Chi town This motel is perfect for a single woman traveling alone  Free contnental breakfast clean safe room VERY reasonably priced easily accessible location  The staff is professional and friendly and provide a free welcome packet with brochures maps and tourist information  I stayed at a pricey downtown hotel the first time I came to Chicago and it was filthy  After I found Heart of Chicago I never went back to the overpriced downtown hotels again  Best value in Chi town  
P => A basic good place for the price Just read a review from another Indy person  Ive stayed at this motel for nearly  years  If you want a very reasonable place to stay cleanliness and an overnight stay its all you need  Granted the or is a bit dated but Ive stayed in other hotels in Chicago that costs me  times the amount and not nearly as clean or affordable  Free parking juicecoffeedonuts in the morning  Ive become well known to the staff and Don is very accomodating in the evenings for information  Book the room take the train nearby or bus or even drive and park and youll have more money for shopping or bar hopping 
P => best value in Chicago I have stayed at the Heart o Chicago a number of times over the past eight years or so and no longer stay anywhere else unless it is unavailable  It is a great value  inexpensive clean safe with very friendly and competent people  The location is not close to downtown but there is great bus service   Clark Street and the red line is not a bad walk  Easy access by red line to Wrigley Commiskey Downtown Chinatown etc  etc  Clark street offers a great variety of restaurants in both directions and I have never felt unsafe in the neighborhood  I have had a good experience at the Heart o Chicago every time and am about to reserve a room for another weekend trip from Indianapolis via Amtrak  
P => 
P => hotel and a lot of history hilton downtown it has a lot of history and a few film have been made here when it was build it was the largest hotel in the world it was called the stevens  
P => Good Hotel Clean and quiet I look for hotels that are cleand and quiet and this one fits the bill  Roomsare well appointed bed is comfortable  Somefood options about blocks up the street  Parking behind the hotel for  per day I have stayed here before and will stay her again  
P => Good overall but weak on little things I was just at the Hilton for four days for a Conference  I always roommate with a friend and this is my first experience with having two bathrooms and two closets  That makes a lot of things easier The room was large and clean and the beds very comfortable  The towels were large and wonderfully plush  I thought the service was good and the staff very pleasant  Now the little things that seemed so odd I drink tea  I used up the two tea bags provided in the room on the first day and they were never replaced though the cups were regularly replaced  Fortunately I bring along some tea myself so it wasnt a hardship but an interesting oversight  There are only two lamps in the room    one over the desk and one between the beds  They were barely sufficient for a room that size  Also there was no way one of us could have stayed up to read etc  without the bedside light disturbing the other person  Finally whoever got the idea that elevators need televisions in them should be fired  If there must be televisions at least turn them down I was there for the National Communication Association    of us  We talk to each other even in elevators    especially in elevators In every elevator the sound on the television was so loud you had to raise your voice to talk  By some coincidence on the last day every time I got in the elevator a commercial yes a commercial for some kind of welding service was running backed by heavy metal style music  A woman got on the elevator and asked alarmed quotIs this a new style of elevator musicquot If only       
P => What a downhill turn this once great hotel has taken Listen folks if you compare to the holiday inn wow what a great stay I had  But this is the Chicago Hilton  It is known for its grandeur and it service and you pay for it What a disappointment for meI have stayed at the Chicago Hilton several times before this stay  When I was a young girl this place was like a palace to me  Perhaps I have become more critical as I aged but I was GREATLY disappointed in my stay  First of all when I stay at an alleged  star hotel I expcet  star hotel service  I am currently pregnant so travelling around and going here and there is diffucult  I was depending on service in order to make my stay a pleasant one  First of all I called ahaed to ask for bottled water to be stocked in my room  Nothing fancy just could I have   bottles of water waiting in my room for me  After being passed to FOUR different people and  minutes later I was told I could order it when I arrived  UGHWhen I arrived at the hotel I stood in line for a long time  When it is my turn it takes a much longer time than usual to check me in  Why My room apparently does not have heat So they ide they are just going to put me in a smoking room Hello could you look at me for  seconds recognize my enourmous buddha belly and realize that a smoking room will DEFINITELY NOT work out for me  I ided to point out that   I am pregnant   The smell alone will make me vomit my entire stay   I am asthmatic and could DIE from the person next door smoking   I would rather not subject my unborn child to nd hand smoke   minutes later the FINALLY find me a room with heat and non smoking  Could they have offered me a seat or something NO I am standing there pregnant with my luggage       and NOTHINGI get to my room and it is a double not a single and I know have  beds  bathrooms and  luxurious robes they used to provide  They are now  Later that evening after dinner and theater I returned to find I had forgotten my contact solution  EEK now at a typical hotel I would be SOL but this is the chicago hilton  Last  star hotel I stayed in just picked me some up from a local store and charged me an arm and a leg  I called to the front desk and was told the gift shop had some but they were closed well thanks for the information and there was a    blocks away that had some  I am PREGNANT people No way am I walking  blocks in downtown chicago in the middle of the night for contact solution  Asked if there was ANY way they could assit me afer I explained that i was pregnant  Nope not a thing they could do  Time after time nothing they could do was their response  Other  star hotels answer is ALWAYS YES with a price    On an added note a friend said her room was terrible I looked  it was  dirty old icky the towels were not something I would use as my regular towels in my home much less my guest towels and the shower was low pressure Overall I would say if you are going to spend the big bucks for a hotel stay   go with the  seasons   if you want cheaper stay at the radisson downtown which has MUCH better service for LESS cost  Too bad       used to be the most wonderful hotel in chicago       now I am suggesting the radisson over it  Also the gym is wonderful but will cost you  extra a day 
P => Do not stay here if you are in a wheelchair I was at the Hilton with my wife who is in a wheelchair and we found the property and to be honest most of Chicago to be very unfriendly to the handicapped  The front entrance to Michigan Ave is not handicapped door equipped despite have two revolving doors and at least  others  Very disappointing for a Hilton property where we paid about   a night to stay  If we were staying more than the  nights and the cancellation policy wasnt so poor we would have switched to another hotel  The entrance doors are heavy and to close together to have a wheelchair between them so you cannot even open the double door entrances one at a time  As such my wife was hit twice in the face by the door despite having friends help to open the doors as the wind blowing made the doors so heavy people would lose their grip My wife travels independently throughout the nation approximately   nights a year for her employer and she would rate this property one of the worse in the nation just for the front entrance  Other than the poor entrance the hotel itself is very grand and once inside is very nice to go back in time and enjoy the elegance of the common areas  We were on the th floor which is their quotexecutive floor  Unfortunately any Embassy Suite has better food and selections than what we were offered  Poor quality wine was   a glass  In fact the last Americann Inn we stayed in Park Rapids MN had a better breakfast  Of course you could order the two eggs hash browns bacon and toast with juice at the hotel restaurant for   for  people Yes very spendy and not inspired in the least  Of course for just under   a night you would expect free Wi fi internet but no that would be another   so I was glad I had my verizon card  I guess you can tell I was not impressed other than the old Chicago feel the property had  Anyone with a disability should think twice before even getting in the front door  It will make a difference in choosing a Hilton property again  I almost forgot if you are not on the lakeside you can count on hearing the elevated train go by every  minutes like we did on the otherside of the property  It made a conference call very difficult  
P => Classic and Grand We had a lovely stay at the Chicago Hilton  We arrived early and they were able to accommodate an early check in at  am plus we received a free upgrade to a room with two bathrooms and a large walk in closet  The room was very clean the linens were luxurious and the soaps were of a high quality  I have stayed in many nice hotels and I would have to put this one high on my list  I did not feel the hotel needed upgrading  It has a very classical feel of high quality and grand ambiance  The room did have an old fashioned TV but we werent in Chicago to watch TV  If I has one complaint the room was a bit too warm  
P => Needs reation Classy old hotel with a lot of history  Friendly staff  Rooms are bigger than typical hotels but in need of reation  Clean though but or is somewhat depressing colors  I even had problems with my lock and TV  Both fixed on time  Safe area but there is nothing around it  The hilton is not on the main part of Michigan Avenue with all the stores and shops  Right across from Grant Park  A bit of distance from closest CTA station so dont necessary recommend taking the metro from OHare I was here for a meeting  IF I had to come back with family would stay at another Hilton somewhere in the middle of touristy areas  But if you had to stay here it is a very nice hotel 
P => Very Satisfied With This Hotel My wife and I were here for only one night so did not take advantage of any of the amenities in the building  We found our room quite comfortable clean  and well maintained  We heard some street noise but there was no sound from adjacent rooms or the hallway The only problem was that the clock radio was set for an hour earlier and we didnt notice until morning  Apparently it never got set ahead for Daylight Saving Time last spring this is ober  And I could see why  I could not figure out how to change the time and most likely no one else could either  As is the case with center city hotels extras are not free  You pay for parking internet service breakfast etc  Visitors should be prepared for this  Also expect to pay extra if you want a view because most rooms are going to face other buildings  And expect big city noise sirens garbage trucks etc  
P => Good hotel Very nice hotel the price paid was a bit higher but you get what you pay for right 
P => Good service for such a busy hotel  We stayed at the HIlton Chicago for the weekend of the Chicago Triathlon and were quite pleased with the services despite the fact that the hotel was fully booked with nervous triathletes AND wedding participants  Staff and front desk were VERY accomodating  Our rooms with a view of the lake were just what we wanted  Weve stayed at the Hilton for several years and enjoy the proximity to the race and local attrations  
P => A great hotel for a conference Attended a customer conference here in ust  and I was very impressed with this hotel  Having attended this same customer conference at different venues in prior years I have to say that the hotelconference experience was the best at the Hilton Chicago  It is a charming hotel with beautiful rooms  The ballroom is amazing  The conference space is well laid out and you dont have to hike really far to get from one conference gathering to another  The location is wonderful  You just cant beat being able to walk out the front of the hotel and be in the park and then within a short walk of Lake Michigan  I did have trouble with the first two rooms smelling very strongly of smoke  They changed my room but for all the trouble I wish they would have offered to upgrade me    at least to a lake view The food served was delicious    especially for a conference  
P => So disappointing I was really looking forward to stay at  The Hilton  in Chicago right in front of Grant Park overlooking Lake Michigan Boy I was so disappointed   The room carpet was dirty the TV broken the bathroom old and leaky  We paid over two hundred dollars a night for a hotel that charges  more for the Internet  dollars for a bottle of water and over  for parkingThe room service quotaddedquot charges were obscene and the menu unappealing One of my colleagues got a room without temperature control and when the breakfast he ordered from room service Monday was still outside his room on ThursdayThe service was regular at best I will definitely not going back to the  Hilton  Chicago  
P => Great Location  We stayed at the Hilton Chicago for our first night on our Route  trip  You could tell from the fittings and fixtures that this was a hotel designed and built during a grand era  Rooms were spacious we had  bathrooms in ours on the th floor  Hotel was in a great location close to the lake and ideal for the start of Route   Parking was expensive but that is usually the case for prime big city locations  
P => Luxurious Stay in a Great Location We spent four nights at the Hilton while on a business trip  We took the Orange Line from Midway Airport and it is five blocks or so to schlep your luggage  Check in was fast and friendly and we quickly arrived at our room on the th floor  We were upgraded to a king bed with two bathrooms  It was probably the largest room I have ever stayed in and we will be forever spoiled by having two bathrooms  One bathroom was quite large and the other was an average size for a hotel  The water in the showers was hot and plentiful and the towels were large and fluffy  For the most part the room was pretty quiet with only the occasional water noise being heard  EXCEPT   the El train is only about a block away  You will hear it in your room especially if you are on the back side of the hotel  The hotel elevators are plentiful and quick so we never had to wait long despite the conventions being held in the building  We did not eat at the Hilton but we did enjoy drinks and some wonderful Irish music at the hotels restaurantbar Kitty OSheas  This is a beautiful hotel and we found the location convenient for walking to the nearby parks and attractions  Biggest beef The charge for internet service is ridiculous   anywhere from     per  hour time period depending on the speed you desire  And be aware that the charge is per computer  My husband and I both had our laptops but only the one who signed up for the service can use it  I cant believe you can buy a dollar cup of coffee at McDonalds and use the internet for free but you cant have free internet when you pay over  per night for a hotel room  Its robbery 
P => Some Disappointments But Better Than Average My husband and I spent a long weekend in Chicago and booked a room at the Hilton at the recommendation of a friend  We were lucky to get a deal online that included discounted self parking otherwise I think we would have kept looking elsewhere for a better price The staff was friendly and professional and got us checked in quickly letting us know that if we wanted a lakeside room as I had mentioned in my online reservation request it would cost an additional  per night  I passed on the lakeside room as it would have essentially negated our parking discount  As it was we got a south facing room on the th floor with a view of the Essex hotel next door which is to say absolutely no view at all  Other minor disappointments included a lack of a refrigerator a small bathroom and neighboring toilet flushes  waterpipe noise loud enough to wake us at night  Also we would have enjoyed winding down at night with some television except that our favorite cable channels Food Network Travel Channel Discovery other quotgeek channelsquot werent available at the Hilton On the plus side the bed was comfortable the AC had a digital thermostat and the cleaning staff didnt readjust the temperature which was appreciated and the halls were relatively quiet  The elevators to the th floor were quick and each had a tiny television showing CNN  We stopped into Kitty OSheas on Saturday and Sunday night for dessert and drinks  The live Irish duo Saturday night added to the ambiance which we enjoyed The hotel is relatively close to public transportation    in particular the Harrison exit for the Red Line  My husband and I didnt feel uncomfortable walking around the neighborhood at night whether to get back from the train station or to just wander around and enjoy the city Overall this was a pleasant enough stay but I think well look for something a little more personal and less pricey next time even if it means staying a few stops outside of downtown  
P => Good Value for Location Our family spent a long weekend at this premium hotel  It is a beautiful historic hotel with staff that is professional and helpful  Our partial lake view room had two full baths  For our family of four two quothistoric sizedquot baths were far better than having one large modern bath  Overall the room was clean and well maintained We chose not to eat at the hotel though there was a Starbucks nearby there were very few other places to eat within walking distance  There is also a good size lap pool which we enjoyed as well We used transit systems as our priy means of transportation  The Harrison red line red line station was a block behind the hotel and provided quick access to downtown  We also appreciated the express bus CTA   to the Hyde Park attractions that left from across the street  To get to the Harrison station you will pass a college dorm so you  come across students being students  Another option is to catch a bus CTA   to downtown from across the street We found the people and students of Chicago to be very friendly and willing to offer advice and directions  We look forward to our visit to Chicago  
P => Nice hotel but money grabbing We stayed here for three nights before we started our Route  Road Trip Upon arrival at the hotel the self parking is blocked off so I ask a jumped up bell boy with a stupid hat if I can park as I have a reservation the very rude chap virtually barks at me that it is full and have to use concierge parking I don t like concierge parking as not only is it over priced  per day in this case I am not lazy and am able to drive into a car park myself  When I pull up to the concierge I ask if I can do self parking and he says ok no problem  The jumped up bell boy then shouts at the guy and says it is concierge only and really talks down to him  So I have to hand over my keys and pay the scandalous fee  It was blatant that there was room in self parking and this was just another way of squeezing money out of their customers as all the reviews on trip advisor states Check in was swift and they upgraded my room because I am a Hilton HHonors member  Room was nice with comfortable beds two bathrooms plenty of closet space and clean  We even got vouchers to get complementary bottled water The hotel is in a great location right on Michigan Avenue and a few minutes walk from the Millennium Park If it wasn t for the unpleasant experience during arrival I would have given this hotel a higher rating  
P => Nothing special    I stayed here for one night  Check inout was fast as I belong to Hilton Honors Club which Id recommend just to make checking inout less of a hassle  We had a room on a high floor that faced west there isnt much to see that far south on Michigan Ave unless you are facing east towards the lake  The room had two queen beds and two bathrooms  Neither bathroom was big enough to swing a cat in    and both were dated and showed signs of wear and tear with peeling wall paper dull stained sinks and tarnished fixtures  We didnt eat in the hotel so cant comment on that area  We did use the indoor pool and it was fine The location is a little bit too far south and out of the way for some sightseeing  It is very close to the Art Institute and Milleninm Park and of course Lake Michigan is just a few blocks east  The area directly west of the hotel feels a little dicey and isnt somewhere that Id walk alone after nightfall  
P => Great hotel but fairly expensive this hotel was very beautiful on the inside  the lobby was big and really beautiful  the rooms were the best part  i was with a friend and they had  double beds and  bathrooms  ive never been in a hotel with two bathrooms in one room before the location was ok  it was beside state street but i would rather stay on magnificent mile next time as theres better shopping up that way  they do however provide a free shuttle to magnificent mile everyday which saves you getting a bus  the one thing that goes against this hotel is the price  its very very expensive  was working out at aroun  euros a night  if you can afford it then its a great hotel but for that kind of money you could stay on the magnificent mile which would be a better location  
P => There are so many great hotels why stay at the Hilton Chicago The lobby was beautiful as was the ballroom  Check in was very slow although the staff was courteous and friendly  I had looked at the rooms on line and was greatly disappointed when I opened the door  It was small and crowded with furniture although no easy chair in ours  When I opened the bathroom door it hit the toilet  Ive had bigger bathrooms in a Motel   The carpet could stand replacing and the bathroom tile grout could use some professional work  The bathrooms have been well covered by others on here  We had a quotcommanding viewquot of the next tower of the Hilton a few feet away  I had requested extra pillows which were not there  There was no coffee or tea in our room  I couldnt get an answer from the front desk or housekeeping so I called the hotel operator  She had someone bring more than enough up in just a few minutes  If you like the news sports and Hilton Chicago channels and a few others the television will be adequate  We couldnt find a telephone book or any other kind of directory i e  churches hospitals etc  The air conditioning system was apparently right outside our window and ran constantly  I will say the air conditioning our room worked very well  As other people mentioned the internet was too expensive  I found the bed too soft  The restaurants were overpriced but we did eat at Kitty OSheas one night  I had potato leak soup  and my partner had Shepherds Pie    Weve eaten both all over the UK and didnt recognize either dish  The Shepherds Pie was especially bad and seemed more like a canned beef soup light on the beef with mashed potatoes on top  There was no discernable seasoning in either dish  The service was slow but friendly  We had trouble several times with our room key not working I heard other people expressing the same thing  The front desk assured us that it was because we had it near credit cards cellphones or something else with a magnetic strip  What we found was the keys worked sometimes and not others  The cleaning staff was friendly and accommodating  Self parking was  a night valet parking  a night  Just down the street hotel valet parking was   The room service menu showed prices increased by     per item then an   tax a  tax and a   room service charge So a bowl of oatmeal at  a bowl room service      The one Concierge person I talked to was not friendly and I seemed to be bothering her  There just seems to be a lack of attention to detail in many areas  One upside is that Buddy Guys Legends is only a block or so away For my money I would go back to the Fairmont  
P => Theyll nickel and dime you for everything possible The Hilton Chicago is a beautiful historic hotel located across the street from Grant Park  The meeting space is stunning full of ornate details  My room was average but I was unprepared for the extra costs associated with my stay  First the fitness center has a charge of day to use cardio or weights  Next internet for  hours will run you    Also if you need a late check out theyll charge you   In order to avoid this fee I checked out and then left my bags at the baggage storage  Guess what A  per bag fee  I also had a problem with the lock on my door   I came back from dinner to find my door ajar  When I followed up with Security they were professional and came up to my room to inspect  However there was no follow up from the hotel regarding my safety no offer to change the locks no offer to move me to a different room  Ive been to Chicago many times and I would definitely stay at another hotel that wont charge me an arm and a leg for quotextras quot 
P => Avoid This Hotel If Youre Paying With Your Own Dime The only saving grace about this hotel is its great location  Its strategically located on Michigan Avenue convenient to the quotLquot and other public transportation and within walking distance to most major tourist spots  Other than location it has little going for it and I would only stay there is someone else were paying the bill   as was our case  The hotel is in desperate need of a makeover the lobby is dark and dank public areas are drably furnished and the rooms are tiny and compact  The two windows in the room overlooked the building next door there was no view  We inspected its sister hotel the Palmer House Hilton and found it too to have little to make the guest feel welcome  Both hotels appeared clean but it was difficult to tell what was below the surface  I know from checking Chicago hotel rates frequently that we could have done much better price wise if we had been paying the bill rather than the conglomerate that did pay  
P => Chicago Hilton on Michigan Avenue is Fantastic Just got back today from a week trip at the Chicago Hilton  The place is absolutely beautiful  Its history includes a ballroom from the s that most US Presidents visited  Even if you dont stay here   go see it if your in Chicago  All the staff was courteous  The rooms were plush with comfortable bedding  Each day your invited to extra tea service and turn down   what a treat The aquatic center is day a little pricey   so I skipped it and walked the city for exercise  Its across the street from Grant park and you can walk to the lakefront in less than  minutes  If your looking for a great place to eat   Wildfire Restaurant and tini Bar    price apps at happy hour   nice relaxing setting   service was fantastic  There is a  floor yes  Macys within walking distance art galleries and many restaurants  Words of Caution Airport Express from Midway is great from the airport but coming back after we pre paid for a round trip   they left us sitting for an hour and  minutes waiting for other passengers to fill the van   my advise   get a good taxi driver to take care of you for the week and to the airport We got Henry   a local  
P => special chicago hilton experience My  year old son and I went to see the yankees lose to the sox  The hotel was so clean and stately I was very pleasantly surprised as was my son  The service at all stations was right on  The concierge was helpful late on a Friday and early on a Saturday  With their help tickets were obtained  I will remember this concierge service for a long time as it was that attentive  Food was outstanding  Location is in the Loop on Michigan and very close to the Museums and the Lake  Room appeared oversized and my critical  year old son thought the whole thing was coolmy word not his  Great pool and excerise roomI coildnt believe the quality including the running track for cold weather 
P => Nice but not amazing The Hilton Chicago is a very big hotel and for someone who usually stays in independent hotels was a shock to my systemVery much a number not a name there as one would expect with that many rooms  I did like the hotel but thought it let itself down on a couple of things The rooms were nice and spacious but just felt old  TV remote didnt work the entire time I was there which was irritating when wanting to watch the news for  hour before evening events etc and when I told them was told oh yes its a common fault the box has reset itself so we would need to reprogramme the TVThe member of the bell team who bought my luggage up did himself out of a ent tip by being overly familiar   using my first name and turning it into a cartoon characters name which it resembles   not a good first impression The lift situation was appalling   they had a couple of big conferences going on at the same time as I was there and had to wait on the first morning  minutes to get downstairs usually would walk the stairs but had a presentation case and over  floors up so not an option The lifts were a continous problem for everyone I spoke to Kittys was nice and food and service was quick and good  In general the hotel was good and the service was fine but the little things do make the difference and probably the bell hop didnt help my feeling about the hotel Another thing   is the leaving luggage charges   I have never been charged for this in my life and was therefore very surprised by that 
P => There are lots of other places to stay     pick one of them The location is great and the lobby is beautiful  The rooms are very dated but are reasonably clean  Everything is true regarding being nickeled and dimed to death  Customer service was the real problem though  Our room claimed to be a non smoking room but it reeked of stale cigarette smoke  When I called the desk to ask for another room I was told I could not change rooms  Also the concierge service was very poor  Although it is a huge place there is often only one concierge on duty  My son and I waited in line behind two women in town on a business conference  The concierge sold them some tickets and then launched into a myriad of personal stories about shows she had seen over the years that had come through town  This went on for over  minutes and she never once acknowledged our presence  Eventually two more women joined the line  After several more minutes another concierge appeared and immediately waited on the women who had come up behind us  When I explained that I had been waiting longer and for over  minutes she ignored me  After the third time I protested she said quotOh Im sorry I didnt realize you had been waiting longer but Im waiting on them now quot My son and I promptly left  The original concierge was still telling the first group about her th time seeing Cirque de Soleil 
P => Probably better hotels in the areaToo pricey in minor issues The Hilton has its perks nice rooms gorgeous or around the bldg pretty good location not the most expensive hotel in this location but still overpriced and a good overpriced Irish restaurantgrillbar Kitty OSheas that is worth going in for the  dollar cheeseburger almost  I heard from a friend that Kitty OSheas is really fun to go to on a weekend night so I suggest doing that if you enjoy pricey drinks cheapest beer on top was  dollars and it was not a full pint and pricey bar food  Burgers were some of the best my boyfriend and I are the we weve ever had  cook them as we requested for them to cook them  What I didnt like about this Hilton and Ive stayed at others where I didnt feel this way is that you feel like the hotel wants to rip you off from the getgo   dollars for a bagel and cream cheese through room service  dollars for cereal  dollarsday for internet I believe was the rate and there was no fridge in our room yet there was in replacement of a fridge a cabinet looking thing that supposedly had complimentary bottles of water for us for being Hilton Honors Members which we couldnt even get open and then just a tag no bottle empty or full in sight of a bottle water that says  dollars  Took us three attempts in calling  getting transferred to make sure we were not getting charged for this ridiculous bottle of water  Also if you are a drinker be sure to bring your alcohol in advance  It is close to two places a carryouts bar and a warehouse liquor store that sell booze  The actual cheaper one for beer is the nice warehouse liquor store  At the carryouts place it is  dollars for a er whereas it is  dollars for a case at the Warehouse store  anywho that was just a side note  LQQK up in the area what are good deals to for going out like Villains is pretty close  has good Sat  night speciails  All in all I had a pretty good time   the Hilton and the Blackhawks Convention being the same weekend didnt bother me at all  Another thing to beware of is the pool situation  It is a nice pool but only has  dividers for people swimming laps  also there are two hottubs but of course children were crowded both of em even though anyone under  was not allowed to be in the hottub  So that sucked  The sun k is really nice and large so try to go there on a nice day  Unfortunately this past y weekend did not produce the sun I was hoping for  That wouldve been enjoyable And if youre into working out but dont believe in paying  dollarsday to use a hotel fitness center this  not be the hotel for you  
P => Nickel and dime you This is an old and elegant hotel  I paid top dollar for the hotel through the conference and was disappointed  They charge an additional  a day for use of their health club which in many hotels is included and they are also extremely petty in charging upon checkout for any luggage that needs to be stored for a few hours they charge per piece of luggage  They also charge for wireless internet connection which in many hotels is now complimentary  Our room was nice enough although the air conditioning did not work properly  All in all I was rather disappointed  
P => Nice Stay We used Priceline and were placed at this hotel for  per night  Location Right on Michigan Ave  close to the museums and Grant Park and public transportation bus and train  The theater district was about a mile away we walked and felt safe at night Room We arrived late and there were no King beds available so we were placed in a room with double beds and  bathrooms  The beds were comfortable and the room was well appointed  Negatives The hallways echoed at night and we woke up several times when late nighters returned to their rooms  It would have been nice if the air conditioning system would have had a fan and we could have used it for white noise  Parking was  a night  There is cheaper parking in a garage near the hotel  Wireless was  per night but was really fast We enjoyed learning about the history of the hotel as well  It is an older hotel but is very nice  
P => Grand Old Hotel   needs some improvements First off   Beautiful building and architecture Check in was OK   friendly   but not overly  Room was nice   very roomy and clean  The hotel is old  Period The rooms are updated but the walls etc    could use some work Upside great pool and fitness center which is completely included with your stay Grand old hotel and architecture Downside The Grant park southside area is a little rough and the streets to the west are also a little seedy at night Downside Internet   day  Parking   day 
P => The Staff steals from you I left my  flat iron hair straightener on the bathroom counter because it was too hot to put into my bag  I was going to carry it down to check out with me to give it time to cool off  I came home unpacked and realized I had left it on the counter Ive been calling them like crazy to get to the bottom of this  Ive spoken with the HEAD of Security who called Housekeeping  of course no one has seen or heard of anything  I spoke with the lost and found SPECIALIST who also has not seen anything  She also gave me a lame excuse about how there is a new guest in the room and they  not have turned it in  WTF If there is a new guest  Im guessing a housekeeper would have cleaned the room If the housekeeper was honest she would have handed it in If the lost and found specialist was honest she would say it was still there and not try to blame it on someone else Granted  I am the dingbat who forgot it on the counter  but who the heck gives them the right to take things And it has only been  hours since I checked out I know thieves move fast  but jeeze   reallyI could go buy a new one  but they nickel and dimed you for everything Even luggage holdcoat check using the fitness center and printing boarding passes WTF 
P => Great hotel great value This hotel is fabulous and a great value  Right on Michigan Ave  it is located across from Grant Park in the heart of the city  Our room was very clean well appointed and had everything we needed  It is truly a grand hotel with old style elegance  The staff was very helpful and courteous  The concierge recommended Miller s Pub for dinner just a short walk away and it was perfect  We will definitely stay here again  
P => Excellent stay in corner suite My spouse and I needed to move out of our home for  hours while it was being quotspring cleaned quot This year we selected the Hilton because they welcome dogs that are up to  pounds  Our large male Airedale is over  pounds   so he isnt allowed in most quotdog friendlyquot hotels  At the very last minute we booked a one bedroom suite on the th floor executive floor  The entire experience at the Hilton was excellent  From the moment that we arrived the staff was very accommodating   especially to our dog They made sure that Oliver had a dog bed bowls treats and lots of attention and praise  They even offered to walk him in the park across the street The suite was updated and since it was a corner south east suite we had windows on two sides   very nice   lots of light  The bed was comfortable and well appointed with plenty of pillows  Room service was very good   we ordered dinner at pm and at pm it arrived hot and well prepared  Breakfast on the executive floors was excellent   nice options including quottake awayquot coffee cups with lids and very friendly and helpful service   especially the concierge  Overall we were pleasantly surprised   we didnt expect much since its the quotold Hiltonquot   and since we just needed a night someplace that welcomed our dog our expectations were pretty moderate  Hilton greatly exceeded these expectations   we would highly recommend this hotel to families with kids or dogs   the hotel staff goes out of their way to make sure that youre welcomed  Finally I have to say the common areas are beautiful and very grand especially the front  story entrance  With the very reasonable rates that Hilton is charging this summer you cant go wrong   especially if youre from out of town   the location across from Grant Park cant be beat P S    Be sure to check and see if you can upgrade your room rate by night to allow for indoor attached parking the usual rate if you dont include it in your room rate is somewhere around night  
P => Love this hotel I have stayed in this hotel four times for a trip to the city  I loved it so elegant and friendly this hotel is underrated in my opinion  My granddhter loved the fluffy beds and the ballrooms  
P => Awesome location  We booked this hotel through Hotwire  per night and please keep in mind with Hotwire you do not know which hotel you are getting until you pay We were very happy with the location of the hotel since it was within walking distance of the metro stations Soldier Field and all of cool sites of downtown Chicago  The price and location again were awesomeThe room was good comfortable bed nice bedding two bathrooms  The main issue with the room was that you could hear the rooms next door bathroom every flush and shower Another lame point but almost expected was the nickle and diming for every amenity ie internet the business center you name it Oh yeah nothing was stolen from our room  
P => Cant believe anyone gives this five stars Rooms dated with poor housekeeping   towels not replaced had to ring for extra shampoo etc  Room service very expensive and almost inedible  chicken like leather  Extra charges for the internet the gym the luggage check flight check in etc Drinks in the bar v expensive  Only plus point   breakfast was reasonable with ent crispy bacon  The pool was shut and being refurbished so lots of building work  Big soulless hotel trying to increase revenue by over the top charging for every extra with the service or and ambience to back it up  
P => Bad Service Poor Housekeeping Standards Expensive food and drinks I was at this hotel recently for  nights   if I could have cancelled and gone elsewhere I would have  I knew it was a bad sign when i went into the bathroom and found a womans long dark hairs on the quotclean sinkquot the quotclean towelsquot and the nest of hairs still on the quotclean shower floor quot Such LOW standards for housekeeping Housekeeping didnt replace empty shampoo bottle unless i asked for them  On two days the pillowcase put on the pillow was dirty when it was allegedly changed to a clean one  Guest services often didnt answer the phone  The bars were charging more for a basic mixed drink  for vodka cranberry which is more than I would pay in NYC at a high end bar   this was NOT a high end bar    The food quality was mediocre at best in the various restaurants and definitely on the high side for a run of the mill Hilton  I was sending a box via fed ex and it took them  days to get the box to fed ex containing my luggage    days I expected it to be picked up the day i left it with them which is a reasonable expectation  I am now a Silver level with Hilton HHonors and quite frankly having never been impressed with their hotels really am wondering why I evern give them enough business for a Silver level  Overall I would NOT recommmend this hotel to anyone nor would I return to it  
P => good location in the windy city this is a very good place amazing rooms and service everything is a walking distance  An absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable Good or and impishly modern 
P => Grand business hotel This is one of those grand old hotels which seems like it has been around forever  It has a grand entrance with high ornate ceilings and sweeping staircases  There are  elevators which all seem to go to different floors only We had a room with  queen beds with  bathrooms which were equally fully equipped  But for some reason I could not pay for the internet with my non US billing credit card  They could not sort out the problem  If you get one of the rooms with a lake view it is absolutely spectacularService was average but you would expect that with more than a  rooms  The breakfast was not included but the a la carte is much cheaper than the buffet  
P => A grand old hotel  that charges too much for internet This old hotel is a very well maintained property  The rooms are large and many have two bathrooms probably due combining old smaller rooms  Surprisingly handy The staff was very friendly and cordial  The only complaint VERY high internet charges up to   for quotpremium quot 
P => superb stay at a great hotel friendly check in  no waiting although obviously will be busy at times  Rooms immaculate and fabulously comforable beds  Very quiet  at least where I was staying  heard nothing at all in  nights   Superb situation with Grant park opposite and buddy guys right next door   Blackies for breakfast or just a drink for local flavour and easy walking to Field museum   Taxis outside all day and evening and not expensive to get to the mag mile or navy pier for a night out   A must for a romantic evening is a dinner cruise from Navy pier  Buddy guys for blues lovers  busy and crowded but brilliant   Dont take notice of the doom merchants  stay at the Hilton   
P => We had something stolen too My  Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the th  I filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them  This was such a disappointment as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago  Our room was really nice with  bathrooms  We had  double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed  We had a great view of the lake and park  The hotel charged us  to check in early am  
P => Second Trip Terriable Experience I have been to this hotel twice the first time was okay nice facilities but I recently went again  My phone and other electronics were stolen from my room and only house keeping had been in there and the hotel has yet to help out  Terriable service terriable view and over priced for its tiny beds and lack of coaperation  
P => Classical Elegance Stayed here for ten nights in ruary   Winter time in Chicago inevitably means spending considerable time indoors and theres surely nowhere better than the Hilton to do that Its a huge property but still manages to maintain an intimate feel staff are particularly friendly and attentive  Located on Michigan Avenue  minute walk from the Art Institute and very close to Field Museum Aquarium and Planetarium  About a ten minute stroll to the heart of the Loop and Theatre District  Also Buddy Guys   an authentic and celebrated blues bar is located directly across the road on Wabash Avenue which runs behind the hotel  Restaurant in hotel very good standard especially for breakfast there is a ent business centre donwstairs and two bars   a lively faux Irish joint and the more salubrious lounge with big bay windows fronting onto Michigan Avenue  Fitness room and pool looked ent too  Rooms are spacious with all the conveniences you would expect from a  star the bath perhaps the only disappointment   its smallish with uncomfortable contours  Such is the capacity of this hotel that at times of low occupancy amazing deals  be offered 
P => I enjoyed my stay  Advicego thru Hotwire you  pay as little as  Previous writers were correct about the prices but there are a variety of nearby places where you can eat more reasonably  The location was great You can walk so many places easily from the hotel  On check in they offered a room with two bathrooms and a view of the lake for an additonal  and I took it  The view was nice the room was nice roomy and one bathroom had a bathtub the other a shower  You really should park elsewhere as there is one adjacent to the block with  parking  
P => A quick but pleasant stay at The Hilton Chicago  I stayed in the Hilton Chicago for just one night with my boyfriend and a girlfriend of mine  We were given a room with two double beds and two bathrooms which was nice to have seeing as the girls could share one and my boyfriend had his own   and the beds were super comfyThe check in was quick and we were given an early check in around  noon for no extra cost  The woman who checked us in was very polite and friendly The room was a ent size and on the th floor but looked out onto the train that passed about every   mins  I thought the noise would be very disruptive but we ended up sleeping right through it but what can you do if you want a hotel right in The Loop They are usually all near the train anywayWe didnt stay for breakfast there as it was pretty pricey  I think it was about  just for continental breakfast yeesh But there is a nice breakfast cafe called Yolk which is about  blocks away right after you pass the Best Western huge breakfast for a great price  Really enjoyed ourselves there We had a quick drink at Kitty OSheas before we left and like all other hotel bars it was pretty expensive   for a rum and coke We also left our bags at the bag check when we had a little extra time to kill before we went to the airport and they charged us   per bag which in the past for myself has been free at other hotels so just a heads up it can be kind of pricey to stay here if youre not carefulThe location was great right across the street from Grant Park and a short walk to Millenium Park The Shedd Aquarium amp Musems and back to the train station which brought us to Midway Airport  It might be a bit of a trek if you want to shop on the Magnificent Mile we ended up taking a  min cab ride  Buddy Guys Legends Jazz club was right around the corner as well which was so much fun Cheap eats and great music its really worth checking outI ended up getting this hotel for an amazing price under USD for a room for  so that was a big factor in choosing it  I ended up getting a lot of bang for my buck but I dont think I would stay there for full price which I heard can be into the s but we still really enjoyed ourselves and found it to be a good place to stay Enjoy Chicago  
P => Tips on how not to get ripped of here       If youve read any of the other reviews of this hotel you are already wary of how expensive this place is and how they charge you for EVERYTHING We have a relative that works for Hilton so we got a deal we couldnt refuse to stay here but I knew I had to hold on tight to my wallet when I walked in based on the previous reviews  Heres some things I learnedRip Offs  Drinks   At  a drink for a house wine or well cocktail the bar in the hotel is absolutely out of control  We didnt have any food at the hotel after this experience with drinks  TIP There is a sports bar one block west of the hotel where you can get reasonable drinks  Its called SLC I think   Parking   Parking at the hotel was around  a day when we were there even more for valet  There is a lot of other parking around there with a wide variety of prices  We found a parking lot one block west across the street and under the quotLquot from the Sports Bar that was  for an over night and then  for the next day  TIP Unless you need to get pretty far out of the city the mass transit system is comprehensive cheap and seemed safe  We rented a car which was really just a hinderance  Business Center   There is a business center but its around  a minute just to use    another rip off    No tip here  Anything in the room to drink   the vitamin waters or regular waters are like   a piece    asinine  The mini bar drinks were similarly priced  Just leave this stuff alone   The gym and pool   The pool was closed when we were there but I heard was complementary I would check that as its hard for me to believe  There is also a gym but it costs day to use  More  Other cons  The rooms were somewhat small but fine  The beds were very comfortable but the bathroom was cramped and somewhat dated  be it was just me but all the quotgoldquot was very gaudy instead of beautiful So why would anyone stay here It makes sense if the following is important to you  Staying at a historic hotel  At one point this was the largest hotel in the world every President has stayed here etc  It is very historic   Money is no object for you when you are vacation  You need to be in the Grant Park area though I imagine there are similar hotels for cheaper in the areaAll in all it wasnt a bad stay but I cant stand people trying to rip me off at every corner so I wouldnt probably stay there again  
P => So Many Ups and So Many Downs This is a beautiful historic legend of a hotel that has all the makings of a really grand place to stay  However it simply keeps getting in its own way and making what can only be called quotDumbquot customer service mistakes that makes it feel cheaper and more money grubbing than it should On the plus side FANTASTIC health club facility Nice lap pool with lane lines great Precor equipment well appointed locker room running track and sun k give the feel of a very high caliber facility  Many regular rooms have TWO bathrooms What a great touch for families with kids like mine  Security stationed at elevators beautiful entrance lobby and classy lobby bar give the feeling of security in a sophisticated setting  Across the street from Grant Park and well situated for a walk to the lakefront Magnificent Mile and many of Chicagos attractions that are easily reachable in good weather within a   minute stroll  Very nice architecture thats been well preserved and gives ambience of class and importance to facility With all this being said youd think quotwow what a great place to stay quot But hold on theres more to report Air conditioning simply DOES NOT WORK Checked in and room was  degrees  After turning down the thermostat all the way and leaving for  hours came back to find room at  degrees  Wound up giving up and simply sleeping on top of the covers sweating Early check in fee of  dollars Im a HHonors Gold Member and couldnt believe my ears when I was told this new fee has begun  After complaining I got the fee reversed but HOW MANY people have just shrugged their shoulders and gotten ripped off Was told by front desk that a voucher for free continental breakfast would be slipped under my door for the next morning  Guess what It never came  Parking fee of  per night I ided to shop around and just behind the hotel is an indoor heated garage thats  per night and requires only an extra  yards of walking  Lord how this would add up over a  or  night stay If you arrive early and cant check into your room the kind folks at the Hilton Chicago will courteously store your bags          at a fee of  per bag Simply stunning Hotel looks for any possible way to add to your bill  High internet charges a arate fee if you wish to inquire about a late check out  cokes in the machine  for eggs bacon and orange juice at breakfast once tax and tip are added in   you get the idea A great hotel is one that  charge a high nightly rate but then doesnt badger you for every little thing Four Seasons learned this lesson long ago They make you feel special not like a piggy bank to be shaken  Although the Hilton Chicago has hosted Queen Elizabeth Charles Lindbergh and a slew of US presidents it has a LOT to learn about making people feel like more than a slot machine to be exploited 
P => Nice but spendy The staff were friendly and helpful  The location was great for walking downtown  I did not like having to pay extra  a day to use the gym  
P => Great Location Old convention hotel with a good location across the street from Grant Park  Rooms and common areas are well kept clean  Staff helpful directed us to a new favorite restaurant Star of Siam  If you plan to shop on Michigan Ave easy walk in good weather or a quick cab ride to Water Tower  When staying in Chicago we prefer several other hotels    there are many to choose but at a low rate paid  this is a good choice  Also check Chicago Omni for specials   all suites and they run parking inclusive specials for night  Thats a deal  At this Hilton ask for a room facing the lake    views are great 
P => Beware the extra charges Stayed here as part of a large conference  The concierge gave me an attitude when I asked for quotreasonably priced foodquot nearby which I found later without his help and everything within the hotel walls was either an extra charge or overpriced  day for internet high extra charge for use of the fitness center business center or any other amenities  Dont expect to check your email for free just because youre a paying guest  The guest rooms were clean enough but I got the sense that they couldnt handle the amount of people they had booked for the conference and elevators were nearly impossible to get at peak conference times    or  minute waits were common  A package was delivered for me and although I was listed on the room the hotel left a quottext messagequot for my roommate only and then required her to come down to the front desk for the package which they then would not release to her because she did not have my ID  Double rooms had two bathrooms but that was the only saving grace   we had a view of the parking garage wall and no light all day  I have stayed in much nicer hotels for less and would not stay here again  
P => Beautiful Hotel that Nickels and Dimes You to Death We stayed at the hotel uary   for the Cubs Convention  The hotel is beautiful and for the  crazed Cubs fans running around this weekend they manage to keep it pretty spotless  Other than the view weve had some years view of another wing of the hotel or of a train track weve had no compaints about the rooms  We have stayed here every year for fifteen years and while service has been exemplary as others said its quotTip pleasequot every time you turn around uary  we also stayed at the hotel  The chlorine concentration in the pool was so high that my three children had full body rashes and refused to get in the pool on the second day  And for a  yr old and two  yr olds to REFUSE to go in the water is highly unusual I talked with other parents whose children has the same problem  We have been to several water parks whose pools are also well chlorinated and never had a reaction like this  I let management know during our stay and then followed up with a phone call and internet complaint once we returned home  They explained that there  might  have been a problem with the chlorinator but they offered NO compensation or even an apology letter  Rather disappointing for someone who holds one of their Silver Hilton Honors Member cards This year just my husband and I stayed not bringing the kids  Our room this year was  with tax and charges  The first year I stayed here it was about     prices have gone up considerably  But the  bottle of water and the  day charge for internet access are over the top we chose to line both  The Pavilion restaurant offers a buffet only during the convention at  person  With a family of five I dont relish spending almost a  on each meal  Buckinghams the steak restaurant apparently closed down recently as it still shows on all of their in hotel literature  Kitty OSheas a pseudo Irish pub is a nice place to eat with good prices  You can get a good burger there for about  if I remember correctly  During the convention the hotel also offers some breakfast items at the bar    you could get a bagel for  or orange juice for   Get the picture I could purchase TWO GALLONS of orange juice for what they charge for a  oz bottle  Thats not kup   thats flat out robbery Overall the Hilton while beautiful needs a reality check for   Youre overpriced to start with and then you overcharge for everything else  In this economy you would do well to rethink your strategy  I would NOT stay here on a personal visit   Id move up Michigan Avenue to something else  Next year I  stay at the Essex next door  Someone mentioned they were there for night and it was great  That would be a  savings each night    pretty substantial  
P => First Class Hotel The Hilton Chicago is elegant and well put together  I had no complaints about the service my room was perfect and the hotel itself is just a beautiful place  The location is pretty good  a quick cab away from shopping and nightlife but not a ton right there  Internet was not free  always a dissapointment for me but this is a higher end hotel  
P => Would stay again in a heartbeat I stayed here for a work conference booked by my company  There was some confusion with the reservation but the front desk was extremely diligent in resolving the issue and I was in my room by the same afternoon  They were very hospitable and the hotel is very grand in design which I like  It is in a FABulous location right across the street from the beautiful Grant Park and there is a Starbucks inside the hotel which has these enormous windows that face Michigan Ave and the park  The best thing in the morning was grabbing a latte and a magazine sitting down at a small table facing Grant Park and people watching The rooms are a bit small but very neat and tidy  Crabtree and Evelyn La Source bath products in the room Plenty of dining options in the hotel if you dont want to battle the Chicago winds Overall an absolutely wonderful experience  
P => Clean   but LOTS of hidden charges and things kept breaking Ive stayed at several Hiltons in the past and always been pleased but that is NOT the case with the Chicago Hilton The room was clean but that was about it  The television is circa  and the remote in our room didnt have a battery but that was probably because the back was missing  I called and did quickly receive a new one  I tried to connect to their wireless and it worked just long enough to charge me the fee   twice I had to constantly call technical support Im a communications officer and get them to fix their network issues  I did receive the military rate which made the rate acceptable but all of the hidden charges  A NIGHT for parking  for continental CONTINENTAL breakfast I mean  pastry  juice  coffee  ARE YOU SERIOUS If you want to use the gym that will be  a day like I work out more than once a day Internet   a day and as I said its completely unreliable  I should get paid for the time I had to spend on hold with technical support   luckily I had the   bottle of water to keep me quenched while I was on the phone  Everywhere you turn there is an extra charge I guess I should have realized what the theme of the hotel was going to be when I checked in and was scolded for being  minutes early which starting this year they will be charging  dollars if you arrive before pm  Uh ok Ill sit in your lobby and be constantly hounded by your overly zealous staff for tips and just wait the  minutes  Like I said  the rooms were clean but Id NEVER stay here again and honestly theyve put a very bad taste in my mouth about all the hiltons    bad taste   now that is priceless  
P => Nice but youre constantly reminded youre revenue not a guest We stayed at the Hilton in ember to take advantage of seeing the Christmas season unfold in a big city  No disappointments there  Chicago is great friendly fun and easy to navigate  The Hilton is in a pretty good location if you want to see the lake or catch a taxi anywhere but it really isnt close enough for walking in winter with kids to any main attractions or shopping  No problem  The hotel is very nice and the rooms are equivalent to most Hiltons   nothing too fancy or big but nice quiet and clean  The restaurant downstairs gave you a fabulous view of the Check In area sarcasm and it was very expensive for ginal food but you kind of expect that from hotel food  The real downside to the hotel is that you are constantly required to cough up some money for everything  Do your kids or you want to watch some legitimate cable shows since the TV channels are boring by design How about  for several repeats from cable Would you like to print out your airline boarding passes at the hotel They cant do that at the desk but feel free to use the computers in the lobby that are there just for that purpose  I should mention it will cost you  to print that boarding pass  Whats that The computer receipt said  They cant help you they say they dont own the computers  Want to check some bags for part of the day because your room isnt ready at  in the afternoon Sure thing   that will be  per bag plus the very overt reach for a tip when you pick them up  Are you exiting one of the incredibly high priced lobby stores with your  mints and are ready to leave the hotel No need to walk to the front door for a cab  Some kindly doorman will intercept you and let you know that he has a cab at the side entrance  Tip please When you get in that cab youll realize he must have had a special deal with a driver that couldnt come to the front entrance in his dented urine soaked cab  Ours was so bad looking the cops pulled it over a block away determined some paperwork was out of order and took it out of commission   letting us get out to hail another cab  And so it goes   quotLet me open that door for you quot Tip please  quotLet me push the elevator button for you quot Tip please  Knock knock  quotHeres an extra towel from maid service quot Tip please  You ordered room service  Tip please as expected  But wait  quotI forgot something and will return quot Several minutes later a different very put out person will arrive with the article  Tip please  The hotel is expensive to stay at but Id rather they charged another  per night per room and then let you enjoy the hotel experience  As it currently stands Im afraid the hotel motto sb quotTip Pleasequot  The Hilton is a nice hotel but as my title suggests youll never feel like a guest because they never let you forget that youre a revenue source  
P => nice hotel Stayed at this hotel for a weekend in early ember  The first night a large charity dinner was going on so lots of people were dressed up in black tie    good people watching while we were eating dinner The next night a wedding was on in the ballroom and lots of Chicago Bears fans were staying in the hotel awaiting the game on Sunday  Totally different crowds but the hotel staff were pleasant to everyone and could easily cope with the large crowds We stayed in a regular room with a king size bed  The room was quite small with the bed taking up most of the room and then a desk and fridge area with the tv on top running down the wall in front of the windows  This made it quite difficult to closet the curtains and the desk chair was crammed between the bed and the desk so there was no room to get around the desk chair when someone was sitting in it  We stayed in a room without a lake view which meant that we could hear the El going by down the street  We could also sometimes hear people in the hall going in and out of the rooms around us but I think they were being extra loud  Basically the room was an average room  If wed paid rack rates I would not have been impressed but we got the room on priceline so it was not as expensive The hotel is a bit far from shopping on Michigan Ave but close to the Art Institute and things in Grant Park so if you want to go shopping you  be better off staying further north We ate dinner in the lobby restaurant one night    the food was fine although a bit expensive for what it was  
P => Great Stay I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of   I was worried that I wouldnt get a nice room since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms  I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic and that is exactly what I was assigned perhaps because I am also a silver member  It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides a king sized bed  The room was quiet comfortable and immaculate  The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left  All the staff were helpful polite and cheerful  I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under  oatmeal coffee and juice  something not possible at a lot of big hotels like the Hyatt I stayed at last year  
P => Nice place close to the Museum Campus I was very impressed with my stay at the Chicago Hilton recently  Only a few minor things prevented me from giving it  stars ProsCheck in was quick and easy despite the kind of crowded main level a lot of big events going on in the ballrooms mean people everywhere  I had reserved a double room which is kind of tricky to find at a reasonable price in Chicago and they had upgraded me to a double room with two bathrooms at check in  The room was nice and ent sized and had modern conveniences despite the historic ness of the hotel  The bathtubs were nice and very clean and bathrooms had granite counters and floors  There was a full size hair dryer instead of one of the typical tiny hotel ones which I didnt discover until the second morning that it was hidden in the closet  The mattresses were very comfortable and had down comforters with the nice white duvets  The room was nice and fairly quite despite facing the west side which faces the El track  The location of this hotel is great  Its within walking distance of the Museum Campus  Also it is easy to catch a quick bus along Michigan Avenue to get to the Magnificent Mile or State Street  The coatluggage check charges item once youve checked out so that was convenient ConsThe TV in our room was pretty poor quality  The picture was a bit fuzzy and the TV itself seemed like it was about  years old  The granite bathroom floors can mean for cold toes in the morning  Our second night when we came back to the room there was a  bottle of Evian on the table that was not there the night before  When I got my bill they had charged us for that nonexistent bottle on the first night  They were able to take the charge off but unfortunately it meant I couldnt use the zip checkout  Also be aware the person staying with me made a  minute   number phone call and I was charged    Not a big deal just something to be aware of This hotel is very close to Buddy Guys legends   a great blues club with ent and affordable Ca food  If you go early    pm theres usually no cover charge  
P => Central to Museum Core Enjoyed our stay at the aged Chicago Hilton although I must admit the catacomb of hallways with floral wallpaper and gaudy carpet reminded me of The Shining  Kept waiting for Jack Nicholson to drive an axe through the door quotHeres Johnnyquot Fortunately I was staying with someone who had gold status with Hilton so we had a very nice lakefront room  I enjoyed the view of the lake boats Navy Pier museums and Grant Park very much  Nice fireworks show over Navy Pier on Saturday night which was pretty cool  The room was pretty big but we did have an upgrade so I cant speak for all of the rooms  You could tell the hotel was old but they had tried to keep it upgraded with newer furniture and tile in bath  I didnt realize this hotel was so historic  Several movies were filmed there like My Best Friends Wedding which they promoted on various literature in the room and the tv show ER films its helicopter scenes on the roof apparently  The lobby was pretty small for such a large hotel and kind of crowded with no where to sit oddly enough  Looked like they had two large ballrooms that I can imagine are used heavily for weddings and what not  With the upgrade we were given access to the Hilton Honors floor which had a nice continental breakfast and cokes you could grab in the morning  Considering HHonors is free definitely worth joining before you go to this hotel to get your free breakfast  Didnt try any of the hotel restaurants although Kitty OSheas was tempting  ha ha Not  I saw the fitness area in the hotel which was REALLY big for a hotel with a walking track and nice indoor pool  A great amenity if youre into that kind of thing or have kids to splash around  Probably the best asset of this hotel was its proximity to the museum core of Chicago  You can literally walk to the Art Institute a few blocks up the street and spend a day there alone  You can also walk toward the lake and access the Field Museum of Natural History and Shedd Aquarium  I cant imagine a better hotel for walking to all of these world class attractions  There are closer hotels to the Michigan Avenue shopping areas and Navy Pier Embassy Suites for one but this hotel is best if you are going to be doing museum hopping and all three of those museums are worth visiting  I heard you could rent bikes and ride  miles up and down the lakefront which I imagine would be cool in the summer time  Dont miss the Frank Gehry designed amphitheatre just past the Art Institute a few blocks from the hotel  Amazing structure and facility  Also dont miss Giordanos Pizza  Yum  We mainly took taxis to from Michigan Avenue shopping areas to eat which cost about   each way  We dropped a LOAD on taxis over a  night weekend but figured it would be about equivalent to a rental car and  hotel parking plus parking in downtown Chicago is about  an hour so that would also add up quick  Great town great hotel  No complaints  
P => Loved the location Had a few problems I stayed at the Chicago Hilton during a conference for work  It was in a great location I could walk nearly anywhere I wanted to go or take a short taxi ride  There were plenty of restaurants museums stores etc within walking distance  The hotel is HUGE My room for one person had  bathrooms A couple of issuesWhen I arrived in my first room yes I had to change the bathroom appeared as if it hadnt been cleaned  The towel was messed up as if someone had dried their hands on it  There was also a lipstick wrapper lying on the countertop  I called the front desk and housekeeping was sent to clean I got so hot the first night that I couldnt sleep  The ac wasnt working well so they sent someone to my room at about  am to move me to another  I was then upgraded to a ior suite and had no further problems  I had a charge on my bill for a mini bar item but I had not touched the mini bar  It was removed from my bill  I would definitely stay here again  The problems were immediately corrected  I cant stress the great location enough  I really enjoyed my visit to Chicago  
P => Very average    I recently stayed for  nights for a conference  I arrived at am after taking a red eye from Los Angeles only to find that they had given my room away  I should say it probably wasnt their fault  The secretary who made my reservation made it for  days earlier They were helpful in trying to find me a nearby replacement for the first night  I came back after one night in the nearby Best Western  Not the nicest but they did have free internet I must say all the reviews are true the good and the bad It is very large and the common places are luxurious albeit a bit old  The rooms are nice enough but the carpet is a bit old appearing  The walls have nice cloth wall paper  The beds are extremely comfortable with down cushion and down blankets  All the rooms have  bathrooms which was nice as my friend stayed with me  The cleanliness left something to be desired  I found a piece of clear wrapping under the table and some crumbs of something on the table  The TV is old but works nonetheless  I thought the water temperature and pressure were excellent  This one point is contrary to what others wrote  The irish pub on location closes early at am on weekdays  The room service also stops early  How can a hotel of this size and prestige not have  hour room serviceThe worst part is that they do indeed nickel and dime you for everything  Thank god I didnt have to park there  Internet was  per  hours  They charge you  to print your boarding pass Enough said I probably would go elsewhere next time in Chicago  
P => Extras could add up to more than room Here are a few of the extras you can expect to pay for to stay at this over priced snooty hotel set in the s with all the ugly grey ble and worn carpets not to mention the huge TVs from the pastinternetparking baggage hold  baglate check out use of gymwaterboarding pass print out upgrade to Executive The showers are not hot and it is very noisy with the train There are no safes in the rooms which make it very difficult if you have a laptop Priceline customers are treated as if the room is free Having a huge amount of HHilton Honors points meant nothing at check in Dont rely on restaurant suggestions Yolk is terriblesalty food and just awful Wanted to go to MHenry    on TripAdvisor and the Conciergesaid she had never heard of it and had worked at the Hotel for  years  I cant possibly imagine why having  bathrooms would be a plus Really I dont understand why any business spends so much of the budget on advertising and treats customers the way they do I also think the price should include the huge amount of taxes that will add to the final bill I have paid as much as  to park for just one day in NYC  This recession  be a wake up call for the Hotel industry  
P => Great rate and two bathrooms I booked this hotel over the phone with HH Honors on the day of arrival and must say that I was not unhappy  I got a spectacular rate and enjoyed the Executive floor happy hour and breakfast the following morning  The room while average in furnishing and quality had the notable feature of having TWO bathrooms  Since I met a friend here on the way home from a European trip I found that to be just an incredible convenience  Dare I say a luxuryClearly the less expensive rooms are the ones without any view   all I could see was another wing of the hotel   but I couldnt complain for the price  Just three blocks from the hotel is a velous restaurant by the name of Custom House that alone made the stay worthwhile  The staff in the Executive Floor lounge is friendly and helpful  There is also a computer terminal available for use inside the lounge as it is   per MINUTE downstairs in the Business Center  The rest of the staff while not rude is somewhat lackluster  The proximity to the Art Institute other loop attractions and perhaps most importantly the El make this hotel an excellent choice  
P => athon madness   and the hotel coped vellously  I was running the Chicago athon and stayed at the Hilton as it is just over the road from the start and finish line This was my nd stay and it was not just convenience that made me return there  It has a wonderful entrance lobby with sweeping staircases to the Grand Ballroom on one side and another function room on the other The bedroom was clean and comfortable  My room mate and I had a double bed each and also a bathroom each The staff were helpful and how they managed to keep going in the professional way they did with athon madness going on all around them is a tribute to them On the downside I was disappointed that the pool and jacuzzis were out of action  I was looking forward to a jacuzzi massage after the athon and the prices were rather expensive  Had it not been for the pool and a couple of other minor maintenance issues I would have rated this as wonderful but will have to settle for above average on this occasion  
P => Recommend Hilton Chicago We stayed in the Hilton Tower Hotel in Chicago in ust  We were assigned a large spacious double room with excellent amenities but had requested a room with a view of the lake and Millennium Park  While tempted to stay in this spacious room we requested a move when we realised that the fridge cum mini bar were unlocked and not working  We phoned customer service and were given a room on the th floor with a vellous view of the lake  We were given complimentary breakfast vouchers for the in convenience  This was a great hotel from which to explore Chicago and would definitely recommend  This was our nd stay with the Hilton Group and would definitely look out for their hotels in the future  
P => Stupid housekeeper stole my husbands laptop PDA and went through my purse My husband and I stayed at the Hilton because we got a good deal  The staff were rude and not helpful  The first night was fine  The second day we were going to leave for the day to sight see and a housekeeper was near by  She asked us if we were checking out and we said no just sight seeing  We returned in the evening to find the contents of our suitcases flung around the room my purse on the bed spilled upside down  Some jerk took off with my husbands bookbag with his laptop PDA in it  We called security and they were slow  There was a bad that was ripped up that didnt belong to us  I demanded a different room  The housekeeper didnt even finish cleaning the room  We filled out an incident report and talked to the security manger who gave us the run around and claimed the housekeepers didnt see anything  WHATEVERRRRRR He tried blaming it on us  My husband works for a police dept and he checked to make sure the door was locked All our pictures of our kids on the computer are gone  The morans who stole it are in for a treat that laptop and PDA doesnt work right  If you go to a hotel never bring anything valuable  Luckily for me I took most of my personal things like credit cards personal info with me in my pocket  
P => Grand Hotel with some maintenance issues Theres nothing like sweeping in the front doors of the Hilton Chicago a quotgrand hotelquot in the early th century tradition  The wide ble stairways the high ceilings the hustle and bustle and delicious smells wafting in from the restaurants    its truly like being in a very cool movie despite the omnipresent conventioneers Overall our one night stay was lovely but red by some deferred maintenance issues    and surprising disinterest from the staff  We had a terrific corner room  Although just two double beds the room itself was quite spacious with windows on two sides and a partial Lake Michigan view where we were able to watch the fireworks from Navy Pier that began shortly after we arrived  The downside poor lighting by just two dim bedstanddesk lamps  which could have easily been remedied by adding a floor lamp certainly plenty of room  The desk was sufficient but with a chair so low as to make it unusable  As others have noted the rooms also lack sufficient electrical outlets which meant the coffee maker had to be plugged in either at the base of the bedstand lamp or in the bathroom we couldnt reach the outlet behind the TVminibar console  The real maintenance issue though was the bathroom with badly peeling paint and some crumbling plaster on the ceiling above the tub as well as strips of epoxy missing from the tub itself  The drain was also badly clogged    or simply not up to the task of draining from a high powered showerhead    which we didnt discover until in the morning too close to check out time to call the maintenance staff  We showered in mid calf high water ugh  When we mentioned this at check out the peeling paint  the crumbling plaster and the nonworking drain the clerk said simply quotGosh Im sorry to hear thatquot and proceeded with the check out transaction  We werent looking for a discount or a comp but its really been on my mind since then that we received such a lackluster response    perhaps because the staff already knows that the ceilings and the drains need work but cant do anything about it  A gentleman behind on the way said out that this has been a problem in the rooms before when hes stayed there The bathroom issue really makes it difficult to recommend another stay although we otherwise loved this grand old hotel  
P => Great Room  Super Service Excellent Location We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago  We booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half athon  The place was busy but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest  The room was nice and just what we expected  The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel The location was great as we were taking in the Bears ers game on a Thursday night and a Sox game on a Friiday night  We would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others  Great quality even at the regular room price  
P => Nice hotel Hotel is clean comfortable and about as quiet as a big city hotel can be  Our room was clean but showing some signs of wear  Staff was pleasent and friendly and for the price we were thrilled  The neighborhood around the hotel could be a little better but if youre heading to the museum park area it is a great find  
P => This Hilton is not my favorite part of town I stayed at the Hilton while on a business trip with colleagues  This hotel was a logical choice because the conference we were attending was being held at the hotel and I curious because I have never stayed at this hotel The hotel is a huge old building and when it was built it was said to be the largest in the world  By st century standards its not one of those Las Vegas style monsters but its big enough to hold a conference with  people attending  Another way to judge its size is by the fact that John McCains presidential campaign was in the hotel at the same time as our conference and we hardly noticed them despite the large entourage and heavy security  The hotels size causes some inconveniences  The elevators are all in the center of the hotel the hallways are very long and maze like and many of the rooms have no view at all But we were here for a conference and didnt spend much time in our rooms  The conference rooms that we saw had the usual too hot  too cold HVAC problems catering was good but not memorable and the basement exhibit hall rooms looked like converted parking lots  The public spaces are ornate and well maintained and my room wasnt quite ready to be refurbished but it was on its way  Doormen were always there to greet and help people and there were always taxis waiting The location of the hotel was my least favorite part of my stay  Its across Michigan Ave  from Grant Park but     miles away from the River North  Streeterville part of town that has most of the restaurants Im interested in  Since the conference kept us busy the     minute walk was a bit much and we went on quite a few  taxi rides to find dinner  I would have been happier at the Sheraton for this reason even though we were treated well by every member of the Hiltons staff  
P => st class treatment I took the wife and kids to Chicago for one last fling before school started back up  When I checked in the staff was very attentive I showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude small tip and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar I didnt get the quotPricelinequot glare and it paid off for all involved  The air and water show was underway on the lake front and we had planes flying over our room  The kids thought it was great  That night we had a great view of the fireworks at Navy Pier  The Sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason  The conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly  It was one of the best times we ever had in Chicago  
P => Know what you are getting Stayed here years ago and loved because of great city view great service and good sized very nice room  Due to taking family members we opted for Executive room upgrades  Could not believe how small the beds and rooms were The double room was bigger than room with king bed  Views were not so good and service was poor  Historic feel of hotel is great and we very much liked the location due to being close to parkmuseum campus etc  Unsure if we would return but if we did we would want to know view and room size ahead of time and hope to get better service  High prices are expected in Chicago however hotel ratings are usually right on the money  Would probably pick better TA rated hotel next time  
P => Charming historical hotel in downtown Chicago The Hilton Chicago is a huge hotel and a very busy one too  The lobby area and rooms are very grand and somewhat colonial  The rooms were not awesomely huge but they were comfortable and conform to Hilton standards  Navigating the guest floors corridors were like navigating a maze but that adds to the excitement of being in one of Chicagos most historical hotels that have housed countless dignitaries from all over the world  Location wise youre right across from the picturesque Grant Park and there is a free shuttle to the Mag Mile shopping district albeit they can do better with a larger bus or more frequent runs  
P => V Early check in was a massive bonus Time has flown by but finally getting round to submitting reviewsI got into town from the train arriving at the hotel around  expecting to just leave my bags with them and then go and explore the city but upon giving them my details they said they had an early check in room available and I went straight up I was at the back with a view of the carpark and I was pretty impressed with the room although I guess having a view would make it much better   beds  bathrooms  cupboards desk and nice tv was great  I was on my own but the amount of space was very useful indeed  Very comfortable beds indeedThe lack of any sort of radiator or heating beyond a not always working air vent was worrying I dont know if its different in the middle of a Chicago winter Paying for the internet was easy but why charge for that these daysI found the actual corridors and everything beyond the immediate entrance very drab and grey looking much more like a bog standard hotel not the sort of thing of place you expect when you walk in I cant judge the food drink or conference facilities as I didnt use them but the lack of icedrink machines was a bit of a pity especially being up on the th floor  To be fair they might have been there but I never saw them and there wasnt anything saying they existed  The  bottle of water in the room didnt get touched though  And I didnt even ask for the key to the minibar The location is definately an issue  Its just that bit to far to keep walking to other places especially the Magnificent Mile you think youre there then its that bit further to go  I guess when theres a trolley it makes a big difference Grant and Millennium Park are very close and great to walk round even when I was there no fountain unfortunately Field Museum and Art Institute very close  And I ordered a lovely deep dish pizza via grubhub com  The ability to order food in was something another tripadvisor told me about so I pass on the same advice Checkout was very quick as I did it via the tv then straight out  
P => Triple check your room before leaving My family and I stayed at this hotel on labor day weekend  I love Chicago and will visit this city again but I will not stay at the Hilton  I do advise anyone who stays here to double and triple check to make sure you have everything I left my dhters blanket and her special pillow in the room after we checked out and reliezed this after our  hour drive home and when it was time for her to go to bed  I knew I had had left it  I called the hotel and I was told that the room was not cleaned and had to wait untill it was cleaned to find out about the blanket and pillow  So I called the next day and was transferred to Lost and Found  The lady said that they did not find a pillow or a blanket in the room and were going to check the laundry department  The pillow is quot sqaure and dark blue the blanket is blue  Hiltons laundry is all white so the pillow and the blanket should stick out when they sort all the laundry  The lady from Lost and Found did not get back to me so the next day I left her a voice message and she called the following day  They have not found the pillow or blanket  The pillow was made from her papas shirt  He passed away two years ago  She sleeps with it every night  I just find it hard to believe that the pillow AND a blanket can come up missing in one small hotel room  Oh and by the way there is a Avian water bottle in every room  If you take it it costs    No one in my room used it but we did get charged for it      for a bottle of water  So be when you check out take the unopened bottle with you and hand it to the people behind the front desk   
P => Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hilton over the Labor Day weekend  Arrived a little after noon  Check in was speedy and staff very polite  We had a spacious corner room facing the Michigan Ave  The room was clean and comfortable  I also liked that the windows opened  We had lunch at Kitty OSheas  The service was great but the food was just ok  The pool area has a nice outdoor patio  Although the pool is closing for reation so I dont know if that will change  The entry off Michigan Ave  is beautiful  The lounge is nice place to stop and relax but as with any hotel quite pricey  The hotel is located close to Soldier Field and Grant Park  It is not a bad walk to Mag Mile  If you dont feel like walking it you can catch the Red Line a few blocks away  Another thing I want to mention which is no reflection on the hotel the panhandlers in the area are in your face aggressive  We didnt experience this further up Michigan Ave  only near the hotel  
P => Good location nice hotel but small beds I booked this hotel room on hotwire for about night which seems to be a really good deal for this area  The hotel is in a great location for seeing the sights downtown  The lobby looks four star but the room didnt really feel so four star to me  The beds which were supposedly doubles were UNBELIEVABLY small  The bedding was very comfy with a thin feather bed and multiple sheets which helped me to forget about the small size somewhat  The furniture and room was nice but the floor felt like it  have been slightly damp  As mentioned in another review the parking fees are crazy and ridiculous day  Luckily we found parking meters on the street right behind the hotel which were free overnight  These meters are hr max during the day until  or pm  The room service breakfast is very overpriced  for a simple continental breakfast but there is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel and a Panera within walking distance  Considering the price I paid I was happy with the room  I would definitely stay there again but I would go elsewhere to park andor eat  
P => Chicago Hilton not worth the cost The hotel is a mixed bag of good points and many poor ones  I just returned from a convention at the hotel  The ballrooms and meeting rooms are lovely  The hotel services were very poor indeed with very rude hotel workers who had little to no interest in doing anything outside of the minimum possible standards of service  This is NOT a desirable attitude in a  night hotel  The restaurants are adequate   but very over priced for the ambiance and quality  The breakfast buffet was very nice   but at  per person I do expect something better than an open to the lobby restaurant  The  half litre bottle of Evian was just the beginning of the nickel and dime behavior of this flagship hotel of the Hilton chain   for a oz soft drink is the standard  The cost of the wi fi in the hotel was atrocious  We were relieved to discover a coffee shop a quick walk away from the hotel with FREE wi fi  The rooms were nice   but  per night should be better than a nice hotel room  The  bath room was wonderful   but the fact that neither of them had any ventilation was highly disappointing  For all of the Hiltons much touted quotbe hospitablequot keting   in this hotel it is non existent  Not one employee could have been described as going one inch to be helpful when very simple matters key cards not working etc occurred  Just from when the airport shuttle dropping off passengers at other hotels and the complete lack of welcome we saw at the Hilton there are several more hotels in the Chicago area that seem much more willing and eager to make sure that you will have a better experience than the Chicago Hilton  I would suggest trying one of them before settling on the Hilton  
P => Overpriced and cramped I stayed at the Hilton a few weeks ago although judging by the or it could have been  years ago  We had a suit with a tiny bathroom and small living area  The room felt dark and depressing  The breakfast was a buffet style and was okay  The hotel is quite big so if you are looking for somewhere that will make your stay feel special and intimate then this isnt it  There were all sorts of groups staying at the time  The oddest was what seemed to be some sort of Harry Potter event  I wouldnt have minded but it meant that the hotels factitlies where all overused  It would more often than not take at least ten minuest to wait for a lift and the pool was full of screaming kids  The service was okay and the other reviewers who comment on the location are also right  This is definately not in the center of things  The last time I stayed in Chicago I stayed at the Four Seasons which was much better and for the same price  
P => Such a place such a location Great place great room great location  Even though there was a big meeting going on Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns the only consequence for us was slow elevators  Ballroom is amazing shops on ground floor a nice throwback  Lake views from upper floors    we were on  I think    are worth it  Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent  Definitly would return  
P => pretty good experience with the Hilton Chicago We my college age dhter and I just returned from a  night stay at the Hilton Chicago  We found the experience very satisfactory  We were given a corner room which was quite spacious and very quiet  The beds were comfortable although the pillows were rather soft for our taste  The hotel is very attractive and clean  Its an old building and halls and meeting rooms are found in unexpected places which is a nice change from the cookie cutter buildings we have now  Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful the bell captain even took care of our recycling We liked the airline check in kiosk in the lobby too this was the first time Ive seen this  The bathroom in our room was fine but not generous  The big problem was with the floor of the bathtub which was extremely slippery  It had those built in strips that are supposed to provide traction but they were almost worn away and no mat was provided  Adding to this the drain was slow so it was a dangerous situation  We had two meals in the hotel one of which was the breakfast buffet  As usual in a hotel of this nature it was expensive but in this case the price was very much worth it  There was a huge variety of food everything from cereal to lox  We also had lunch at Kitty OSheas which was fine but nothing special  Prices were a bit high but not painful  Theres also a Starbucks in the lobby during breakfast hours with a comfortable sitting area adjacent  The hotels location is a mixed blessing  Its across from Grant Park with some shopping and lots of restaurants nearby  You can get to fast food or a reasonably priced sit down meal within a block in any direction  Theres not much in the way of shoppingthough the big stores are about a half hour walk or a ten minute cab ride  Its on the loud side though Michigan Avenue is the front of the hotel and Wabash is in the back with the El running all night  I like the train sounds but some might not  The elevators were slow most of the time  There are  banks of them which all operate from arate controls so people press buttons on all  banks which means that extra elevators are always on call  There must be a more efficient way of dealing with this by now rightThe most annoying thing about our stay was the outrageous price of internet access  It was something like  per day and  per week  There is a Caribou Coiffee katty corner to the hotel and a Panera within  blocks but still  Its about time hotels stopped this infuriating extortionate practice  Im happy to have them charge everyone a dollar a day for access  Surely that would be enough to cover the annual costs  Enough already Can Trip Advisor help with this Lets start a movement 
P => Impressed I was impressed by the hotel  I think we were given an upgrade because we stayed on an executive floor   The room was extremely clean and had two bathrooms which was convenient for getting ready  The triple sheeted beds were very comfortable  The only bad thing is that the hotel is a little bit of a walk from the Magnificent Mile and Navy Pier but it is right across the street from Grant Park  There is also a free trolley stop across the street  This was one of the best values in Chicago at the time we stayed and I would definately recommend it  
P => Let the conceirge book your tickets The hotel is well located across from Grant Park  I had a lovely view out of a window that actually openedyeah  The only complaint of the room would be the faded carpeting and ugly bedspread   needs remodeling  Last time I stayed years ago it seemed in better condition  The bedding is great and amenities really more than adequate I did take issue with the fees charged in the business center I just wanted to book a train online and it cost me over  dollars in internet usage fees to try to buy a ticket that was    I finally called their provider LogicLInk to complain  quotNo problem  well credit back half and give you extra minutesquot  Ive been trying for a month to get my credit to no avail I advise using the concierge do your booking for free  
P => A nice hotel in a great location My husband and I stayed four nights in this hotel  We booked an executive floor room that allowed us to use the Executive Lounge on the th floor  The check in was quick and painless  Our room was nice and clean  The bed was very comfortable with high quality linens  We really could not find a thing to complain about  It was a nice hotel and the location was perfect  It is across the street from the park and it was a pretty easy walk to the sights  Chicago is a beautiful city  Go and enjoy 
P => Elegant but Awful My experiences here pretty much mirrior reviewer Lous coupled with the fact that I was pretty much treated like dirt because I was there on a Priceline reservation  We checked in wearing ball game attire but were otherwise well groomed and clean  The hhty clerk forced me to repeat my entire address twice even though my drivers license was right on the counter in front of her  Tried to upsell me twice during the transaction and reapeatedly mentioned that I was on a quotPricelinequot stay  The coup de grace came when the clerk asked my wife who was by my side quotwhat her name might bequot Ive never had this happen anywhere ever  I can only conclude thatsince she did not record my wifes response anywhere or ask her for any ID this was just further Priceline related harassment  I will complain vehemently to Priceline about this Also Priceline lists this hotel as located in the quotLoop Millineum Parkquot  zone  It is in neither  It is a  cab ride to the center of the Loop and is   long city blocks S of Millenium Park  Excepting the frontage on Michigan avenue the hotel is surrounded by several blocks of shabby neighborhood  If you venture out you WILL be aggresively panhandled day or night  So if you bid that zone  my condolences if you receive the Hilton Chicago  which you likely will as despite thier poor treatment of Priceline customers according to several relevant forums they need Priceline pretty badly   The are the   supplier of rooms in that zone  
P => As peacefull as an airport on Monday morning If you are looking for a hotel that provides chaos noise  and a dinky little overpriced room this is the place for you  Be prepared for a  minute check in and do not count on getting the room you requested I didnt  The lobby of the hotel is impressive although walking through it is about as pleasant as getting through an airport on Monday morning    and airport food is better priced  This place is EXPENSIVE they charge for everything in fact I am surprised they do not charge to use the elevator  The hotel is located in a busy part of town and the sound of police sirens went on throughout most of the night so good nights sleep is out of the question It is an old hotel in a historic building to bad the ac unit is original equipment the room never did get cool enough to sleep well Please take my word for it you do not want to stay here  
P => Pricy but very nice  bathrooms This was part of our annual school trip from Kentucky with  kids and  adults  We had  rooms and a lot of preparation went into this  I spoke with the group sales manager itza and she was consistently friendly and helpful in the weeks prior to the trip and during our stay Check in was friendly quick an efficient  The safety deposit box system is stellar  They are in a secured room and two keys are required  Awesome and comforting Rooms were very spacious and clean  All the rooms with two beds have two bathrooms  I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and have never seen a hotel room with two bathrooms  Wonderful when you have multiple adults or  kidsThey have a parking garage with covered valet service  It does cost extra to park though  I think it was day  The location is awesome  Michigan Avenue at Grant Park  Walking distance to Shedd Aquarium Planetarium Field Museum and Soldier Field Negatives Each room had a wet bar which was not locked when we got there  With middle school kids this was a problem  However this was fixed quickly by the staff  Snacks and drinks are very expensive  Other than that I cant think of anything else  
P => Big and Beautiful stayed at the Hilton Chicago on S  Michigan Ave they advised getting off and Roosevelt Station and walking a half mile trek  Thought on the metro map that the Harrison station looked closer red line but followed their directions and found the hotel easily  The advice of folks here was true it was a pleasant and very safe walk  Note The free trolley has a stop right outside the Roosevelt station and could have dropped me very close to my hotel if I had known about it  They have a system of free trolleys that run several different routes during the day until pm through the summer  This is a GREAT way to see the city for absolutely nothing  During the Taste they are running until pm So   hotel  amazing  it is immense  rooms  The lobby is gorgeous even if you dont stay there you should step in to have a look around  I got a Priceline deal of each night and after a bit of pleasant haggling was given a King non smoking room  Now  this place was gorgeous and truly a  star hotel but the room was on the small side even though it was a corner and overlooked Grant Park  The thing that bothered me was that they nickle and dimed you to death  A bottle of water left in the room was  coke from the machine was  WIFI was  day and if you wanted to print something it cost you   To me thats outrageous and frankly a big turn off P S  The Harrison station was MUCH closer and just one stop away from Roosevelt  I took that on the way out and it was more convenient  Also there are KFC Pizza Hut Dunkin Donuts and my favorite Harolds Chicken just behind the hotel on Wabash   if you are looking for fast food  But enjoy the Taste if you go 
P => Loved the Hilton Chicago I really enjoyed staying at this hotel  It offered everything I was looking for and made my stay in Chicago one of the best  Thank you for the lovely accomodations 
P => Tacky Overpriced Falsely Advertised There must be someone left in the world who finds an overkill of faux renaissancebaroque touches in a North American hotel room charming  Not me or anyone I know or be this place is just trying to compete with the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo CA  Its just gross Everything from the rooms to the common areas is a living tribute to low class flea kets and thrift stores  The carpet and walls are splashed with stodgy old surface patterns reminiscent of s nouveau riche bad taste  The views from three sides of the building are ugly or nonexistent  My room smells like a Crabtree and Evelyn store  When I went to open the entertainment center for some visual relief I found an old analog tube set instead of the quot HD flat screen advertised on the hotels web page    per day for internet access that I get for month at home is not a quotnominal feequot as advertised on their web page  Nor is a  bottle of evian  Its next to Millenium Park which is great but this hotel is still a long way from any business or entertainment centers  You wouldnt know it from the price tag    night for the most basic room  There are too many other good lodging options in Chicago to settle for a tasteless and overpriced room at the Hilton Chicago  Definitely eep shopping  
P => We didnt know I reserved a  bedroom suite in ember for a e weekend  The website states it has one room with  doubles and one room with a king also includes a parlor  When I checked in the clerk told me we had  and   When you get to the room  are listed on a plaque together and have a erate enterance at the end of the hall  You go in the double doors to a little foyer the room enterance to  is off to the right and  is straight ahead   was the  double bedded room with  bathrooms   was a huge room with a wet bar lovely views a king size murphy bed a sofa with a fold out bed a loveseat and assorted chairs  This room had one bathroom  We believed that this was the two doublesone kingparlor and this was sufficient for us but we had another relative that ided to come in at the last minute and I couldnt get another room unless i paid almost double for a single room than what I paid for the suite  So we reserved a room at the Swissotel and she cabbed back and forth over the weekend  Upon checkout we examined the bill and there was a charge for food and beverage  Called down to see what it was and was told it was for a bottle of water from room   I said we dont have  we have   The person said you have the two bedroom suite that encompasses   The check in clerk never told us that and we wouldnt have known because the entrance to  is outside the double door entrance to the suite  I had someone check and sure enough our card opened the door to   We had shelled out over  and countless cab fares for another hotel room and had an empty room with a king size bed sitting there all the time  I felt sick  They did check with housekeeping and verified that the room had not been touched  They took off the beverage charge and gave me a slight credit  I think they were unwilling to do more because I had such a good price on the room  The guy asked when I had made the reservation because he had never seen a price that low  Other than our unpleasant surprise at the end of our stay we were very happy with the accomodations  There were a few gnats in one of the bathrooms but not a big deal  My mom could sit at the window and watch the boats on the lake  We are all women so it was nice to have  bathrooms  The staff was all very nice especially the waitress at breakfast at the Pavilion and the Valet guy  Id like to reserve that suite again not hopeful about getting it at the same price though because I have been checking for different dates and have never seen it for less than twice what we paid  If we are lucky enough to stay there again we will know what to expect 
P => Hilton On South Michigan Should Be Better Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting  The hotel has some elegance in the lobby meeting rooms and lounges   the hotel rooms could definitely use updating  I would definitely say that for the price of a room here   the rooms should be top notch  My car was misplaced during valet parking our reservations were messed up hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items room service a new coffee pot laundry that wasnt ours I would not stay at this property again  There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave  It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers  
P => Wow The first impression is the beautiful lobby and cafe  The work out center and pool were the best in any hotel Ive seen  Service was excellent from all staff  We booked through Priceline   what a pleasant surpriseIts across the street from Grant Park amp the Art Institute  
P => Good hotel overall I liked this hotel overall  We booked through Priceline and saved a lot of money  It is not quite in as good of a location as North Michigan Avenue but is still in a good location close to Millenium Park and for the money you save is well worth it  It is an older hotel but the lobby is immaculate  It is huge as well and was very crowded the weekend we were there  The room was a little small and we didnt have a nice view were on the th floor  However the bed was very comfortable  The water pressure from the shower was a little light so this wasnt perfect  Its probably not the very best hotel in Chicago but it is nice and clean and a good value compared to other prices that Ive seen in this city  
P => Comfortable stay I stayed at the Hilton Chicago the last weekend of il on a Priceline bid night and was happy with my stay overall  Check in was a breeze I waited only a minute  There are also self check in kiosks to use during busier times  Despite my low pre paid rate my request for a spacious quiet room on a higher floor was readily accommodated  I was offered a lakeview room at an extra cost of night but I lined  I was given a bright spacious room with a king size bed on the th floor with a west facing city view Loop skyscrapers  I found the brown and gold or rather boring and dated but the room must have been newly reated because everything seemed brand new and spic and span   not a stain in sight  The bathroom was also spotless  Bed and bath linens were pristine bright white soft and high quality  The room was quiet except for howling winds one night and I slept really well Only shortcoming of the room the thermostat wasnt working well so the room got a bit chilly at night  It wasnt a big enough deal for me to bring up with hotel staff  Also the room lacked a safe which was a minor inconvenience As expected for a hotel of this size the lobby was often bustling with tour groups and convention goers so it wasnt a very relaxing place to hang out  However despite the crowds I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the elevator  The hotel doesnt offer free wi fi but there are nearby coffeeshops that do including a Caribou Coffee at th and Wabash just  a block from the hotels th St  entrance  Hi Tea a fun off beat teahouse on th St  also has free wi fi as well as dozens of tea selections and tasty sandwiches salads and gelato  Yolk  blocks south of the hotel is an excellent breakfast place  With all these great choices nearby I never tried any of the dining options within the Hilton Some reviewers consider this hotels location to be too out of the way but I actually enjoyed the chance to explore the Loop and South Loop  There are convenient bus routes esp  the No   right outside the hotel to whisk you up to North Michigan Ave  or elsewhere in the city I would happily stay at the Hilton again esp  at a bargain Priceline rate  
P => Nice location but some negatives I stayed here for  days over the period of  to  as part of a conference located within the hotel  First the positives The hotel has a classic elegant feel to it  The ballroom is beautiful with exceptional artwok high ceilings and amazing chandelliers I found out this is where they filmed the final scene in the Fugitive movie with Harrsion Ford  Check in was fast and painless with plenty of staff manning the front desk  The concierge was helpful and provided us with a good map for exploring the city  The taxi stand is quite good and there are no problems getting a cab   The location is nice  It is about a  block walk from the Jackson stop on the Blue Line so one can get from the the airport to the hotel pretty easily with just the  metro fare Now the negatives  I felt like the hotel nickled and dimed the customers for everything  Internet  hour and   per day  Want to use a treadmill in the gym    Checking out and want to leave your luggage at the desk  per bag  Very annoying given the rates of the hotel  The hotel has a very antiquated ACHeat system and it was impossible to get the temperature adjusted in the room  First night I froze and the next night was too hot  Certainly in need of an upgrade  The dining options were limited  There is an Irish Pub Kitty OSheays with mediocre food and an average atmosphere adn another restaurant that was more formal but with an average menu  There were many elevators but several were not working and we often had long waits to get to our rooms  Overall I dont think I would stay here again unless I had another conference in the hotel  Given my expectations I was somewhat disappointed and would explore a different hotel next time  
P => Our Home in Chicago It can be difficult to read my moms opinions because she is the nicest person in the world and she would never ever want to hurt anyones feelings  So when she said that she liked her room at the Hilton it didnt mean much other than she didnt hate it and wasnt miserable  But the next morning when we were walking down Michigan for enormous breakfasts at the Artist Restaurant and I was pointing out the Hyatt and other hotels Id stayed in over almost three ades of visiting the Windy City she casually referred to the Hilton as quotour home in Chicagoquot  The deal was done the score settled the Hilton Towers is her favorite Chicago hotel and it is unlikely that we will ever stay anywhere else when we come here This is a lovely hotel gigantic and fully earning its four stars in every respect  Everything there seems to be new and in great condition from the fancy coffee makers in the rooms to the carpet in the elevator lobbies  It all seemed new to me when I stayed there three years ago and yet it looked new now  I get the impression that the place is in a state of perpetual tasteful refurbishment  Not bad for a hotel that dates to   We had booked three rooms at a highly discounted rate a single for my mom a double for my sister and her son and another double for my dhter and me  As we checked in I mentioned to my mom that if it was available I wanted to upgrade my room so that my teenage dhter could have her own bathroom  Yes we are spoiled and so are our children  Mom is well aware of the fact that I and my three siblings grew up in a one bathroom home that had a tub but not a shower and that we all turned out just fine  I dont know if the young woman who was checking us in had overheard me or if we were just lucky but all three rooms were upgraded at no additional charge to two bathroom status  Mom was flustered but also kind of thrilled extra bathrooms DO make us feel special  All of our rooms were equipped with luxury bedding    quality cotton warm comforters fine pillows  The beds were made well  This is important to me  I have stayed in hotels where the beds were sloppily made up or where the sheets were thin andor clearly made of cheap man made fibers andor not big enough for the bed Seriously just ask me about the night suite that overlooked Niagara Falls     great view ridiculous bedding  Dont get me started  At the Hilton the beds are made for luxiourious fabulous sleeping  My dhter looked forward to and once again loved sleeping there and yesterday our first day home she began lobbying me about getting sheets comforters and pillows for her room to duplicate the Hilton experience here at home  Fat chance The weather was vile that night and thats an understatement  The concierge suggested several places for dining with teenagers but they were all at least six blocks away and we would have been drenched just getting into a cab  We opted for staying in and ordering a pizza  We passed a quiet night given the wild fury of the winds just outside our windows  My sister and mom said they heard nothing at all during the night  I was in a different wing of the hotel and I heard the wind the el and the sounds that a hotel makes that can be heard on the th floor  These were soothing sounds and my dhter and I slept well  We loved the HBO Didnt use it this time but we liked the indoor pool on previous visits  BYO HO    the bottles supplied by the hotel are  each  Seriously Views vary  My moms room had a view of the Shedd and the planetarium if you stood in a particular spot near the window and craned your neck  My room looked out at windows identical to my own as did my sisters  But we werent there for the views Most importantly we felt safe at the Hilton  Yes we spent just a small amount of time there just enough time to watch a movie Ferris Buellers Day Off and sleep very well thank you  But if we hadnt felt safe we would have found another place to stay or would have just gone home to Grand Rapids MI  In the morning before we checked out we explored the hotels ballrooms reception areas and convention facilities  This is an historical property and we enjoyed our wanderings very much  The grand ballroom is an architectural as well as an engineering vel  I recommend this hotel if youre traveling alone with family or with multiple generations if youre interested in Chicago history or architecture if you need a place close to the museums if youre looking for something romantic or if you want someplace to stay with your kids  For me the Chicago Hilton is simply the best possible shelter in this wonderful city a place that makes me and my children feel welcome pampered and that we deserve every good thing  So my mom is right The Chicago Hilton is absolutely our home in Chicago  
P => More good than bad    We stay at Hilton hotels often due to work travel and are gold hhonors members  This trip was for pleasure and since it was off season I ided to try Priceline for the first time and was pleased to get Hilton Chicago  The check in was quick and the staff member was happy to give us a nice lake view room on the th floor despite getting the room on Priceline  Buckingham Fountain as featured on ried With Children was almost right across the street and would have been lovely had it been summer and running I thought the hotel was beautiful and well maintained  Our room was on the small side but had two windows which we could open about four inches  I couldnt hear the El but there were enough sirens to make up for that  The bedding was wonderful and the bathroom was very clean and well appointed  I think the hotel is situated perfectly for those most interested in museums Millenium Park and walking along the lake  We like walking so the location didnt bother us too much but I would say it is as far south on Michigan as I would be willing to go  Its approximately one mile from the hotel to the start of the Mag Mile a bit less to the theatre district  We saw Jersey Boys and absolutely loved it We thought the hotel nickel and dimed a bit     for  minutes of internet in the business center  to use the excercise room  to store bags  The room service prices are quite high so we didnt avail ourselves of that service  
P => Stay Elsewhere I live in the Chicago suburbs and stayed here for a weekend to attend a company meeting  I am mystified by the favorable reviews so many people have given  be I stayed on the worst floor in the hotel or some visitors are so in love with Chicago that it carries over to their reviews of the Hilton  I wouldnt want to stay here if I was from out of town not with all the nicer hotels in Chicago  The halls are orated from the s the hallway carpeting and wallcovering are dated worn out and ugly and smelled  The couches and chairs near the elevators on my floor havent been replaced in ades  The room was very small and very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable  As another reviewer noted the heatAC really couldnt be regulated and the room was very warm  I opened the window only to find that the EL trains sounded like they were going under my bed even though they were  blocks away  My company has offices and conference rooms literally next to the EL and the noise in the hotel room was ten times wosre than in my office  I would suggest you do not stay on the west side of the hotel especially if ytou have trouble sleeping  The  parking is highway robbery and the restaurant is overpriced  On the plus side the lobby is your typical grand lobby from another era and the ballrooms are also very nice  The food at our meetings was good but the bad outweighs the good  
P => Mostly Positive I have mixed feelings about this property  It IS a lovely Grand Style Hotel with a lot of history  The lobby and public areas are beautiful  The rooms are nicely furnished and are comfortable However there are a few minor issues  I feel the location is not ideal  If going to the museums is at the top of your list this is a great hotel  If shopping on the Mag Mile and frequenting the nice restaurants or bars in River North or the Gold Coast areas are high on your list Id stay somewhere closer to those areas like WackerMichigan Streeterville North Loop Mag Mile or the Water Tower area  It is quite a trek to those areas if you are walking  Cabs are faster but can add up  Our room had two beds and two bathrooms and that was fine wih me I love having my own bathroom so I can spread my things out  The room was in the back of the hotel and we could hear the El all night so that was a bit disappointing  The room was a bit warm even with the AC cranked up so we opened the windows and that is when the El noises were heard  All in all    it is a very nice hotel but Id recommend staying a bit farther north  
P => Great comfortable hotel Loved this hotel from the moment I crossed the threshold  Great attentive service from the check in staff at the front desk and I was immediately upgraded to the executive floor floor  and above  The room was spacious comfortable and nicely orated  The hotels location is great given that you can take a stroll up Lake Michigan by accessing Grant Park outside the hotel  I managed to take a few nice long walks to walk off lunch and dinner Downside is that you have to pay for wireless internet access but at  a day its much cheaper than what I am used to paying in European hotels Overall a great hotel and does exactly what youd expect  Highly recommend it if you come to Chicago to visit  
P => Classic Hotel and a great stay Stayed here for a conference and the hotel seems to be quite busy at all times  Has everything one would expect from such a hotel and the public places are excellent  Close to the Field Museum in one direction and the Art Institute in the other direction  Rooms  be fairly small but are quite comfortable  Excellent fitness rooms but in room WiFi seemed pricey at  a day  Walking distance to the El and underground and a lot of nice places to eat nearby  
P => Great hotel great or Stayed here for a conference and really enjoyed my room it was clean and well laid out with a lot of character and it didnt seem like the generic and sterile hotel room  It was a little far from the Magnificant Mile but since it was the beginning of spring when I was there it was a really nice   minute walkstroll or quick cab ride  The service was great and thehotel a several restaurants to chose from  The hotel was close to the L train but could only hear it during the afternoons so it wasnt that distracting  Had a relaxing stay and would definitely go back again  
P => Good Old Style Traditional Hotel This is a massive hotel that appears to have many conventioneers located just south of the Loop in Chicago  The location is not bad however its a bit south for my liking to the Magnificent Mile but is close to McCormack Place and thus the appeal to those at conventions  I wouldnt want to be any further south than this as the neighbourhood starts to get a bit quotiffyquot  The hotel is just huge inside but check in was very smooth and incredibly pleasant  The hotel has a ton of elevator banks with comfortable sofas on each floor for you to sit in case there is a wait but there never was  The size of the hotel is obvious when you have to map out your journey to your room  Many twists and turns await           its a HUGE hotel  The room was quite nice  Large with TWO bathrooms it was not a suite either however I believe we did get an upgrade  Hilton Honours members get a coupon for complimentary bottled water and receive a USA Today at their door the next morning  The beds were definitely on the small size         had a room with two very small double beds  TV was large   only problem    you have to navigate through the usual solicitation to buy their movies before you get to normal TV  All the staff was very helpful and EXTREMELY pleasant  Despite its size this is a well run hotel with very content employees which makes all the difference in the world  No wonder this hotel has been a Hilton landk in Chicago since the late s  
P => Fitness fans Fork it over My husband and I stayed at Hilton during a conference Things we liked two full bathrooms in our room convenient lobby coffee bar that converts to a wine bar in the evening easy walk to a number of museums and parks friendly staff comfortable seating areas and in hotel restaraunts clean room and bathroom friendly staff  Things the might keep us from staying again  Hilton charges guests including HHonors members  to use the fitness area  The equipment is average at best  There is no charge to use the pool hot tub and small track and no charge for gold HHonors members  A group of guests in line to use the fitness area all left when we learned about the  charge per person  I was disappointed that this isnt a fee they waive for guests   or HHonors members   The heatingair conditioning is not controlled by a thermostat but by an onoff switch   maintaining room temp is a challenge   There were errors on our bill   Self parking was  a night other hotels within a  mile charge  to  for valetIt wasnt the worst place Ive stayed   but also not the best  Im still on the search for a Chicago hotel I can count on  
P => Watch out for newly reated rooms We were not just disappointed we were horrified  My husband and I have been Hilton fans for years  We are HHilton Gold members and use the HHilton American Express card to accrue points for free stays  If wed been able to complete the guest survey on the TV we would have  But there was a notice that a survey would be sent by the manager  It never was Although the historic hotel is gorgeous the service good the restaurants and bars okay crowded when theyve booked conferences usually on weekends   the room was a nighte  We found out from a staff member after complaining about a smell like paint that our room had new carpet new wallpaper new varnish on the baseboards and new furnishings  Can you imagine the outgasing of the fumes from all of these chemicals The FEMA trailers in Mississippi were abandoned for that reason  Although it was cold and windy outside at least we were able to keep the windows cracked open  The heat was controlled by us so that was good We would have asked for a new room but my husband hurt his back lifting carry ons into the overhead bins and couldnt move  We stayed in there for the weekend so we didnt have to physically pack up and move all of our stuff out  Room service was a godsend The main point is that you should ask if a room has been recently reorated and avoid it  I cant believe the new owners of the Hilton chain an investment firm the Hilton family sold out would treat clients like this  Their main concern is profit  Thats obvious  
P => A very pleasant stay My family of four stayed here in ruary for six nights  We had a wonderful room overlooking the ice covered lake  Rooms spotless and very comfy  Hotel staff very pleasant especially Billy the Bell Boy who could not have been nicer or more helpful  Lots of activity going on which kept my kids occupied  Kitty OSheas very pleasant and lovely Irish man running the bar We would recommend this hotel to our family and friends and hope to return some day in the very near future  
P => perfect location for that wonderful vacation i stayed in this hotel in ember  i was visiting chicago on a shopping holiday and this hotel was available its a fab spot to stay rooms are so spacious and the hotel has plenty of amenties to keep you occupied  they have a fab pool and gym area and kitty o sheas bar which was a pleasant bar to have a drink over all this hotel is one of many top hotels to stay at met wonderful people and the staff were fantastic will be visiting here again this ember see you all soon   
P => Great for a little get away and a good nights sleep  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton for an awards banquet that was held there  It is a very beautiful hotel and everyone was friendly We had a room with a king size bed  It also had  bathrooms which I guess is common for this hotel  The room was a little small but we werent there to just be in the room  Everything worked great and didnt have any problems  I love the fact that hiltons have recently updated all there beds and bedding  It is so nice to have a good nights sleep even though you are staying at a hotel The Grand Ballroom is beautiful and has a cozy feel to it  The food at the banquet was greatWe ate breakfast at the Pavillion an in hotel resturant  It was a little pricey for what you got but we were in the city and prices are a bit higher there  I would not recommend there omletes as the eggs were not real eggs  The waiter was great and very helpful if we needed anything Check out was a breeze Parking was   for non valet and you need to get your ticket validated at the check in desk What a great piece of history to be in  
P => Thanksgiving in Chicago and Im Scottish This was a truly magical Christmas experience so much so that we have stayed there  times and would go back every year  Kitty OSheas and Buckinghams steakhouse in the hotel were brilliant The oraion in the hotel was OUT OF THIS WORLD there was a pianist playing classical and Christmas Carols throughout the day  There is a huge tree and wooden life size soldiers greet you at the door  There is no escaping the festive season The facilities and rooms are immaculate and very spacious considering this is a city centre hotel  We had a view into Millenium park which was great to see when the snow was falling heavy Although not on the mile please do not let this put you off we enjoyed walking each day to really experience Chicago  State street is only a few blocks away and the shopping is fantastic  Anywhere they could hang a wreath with a big red bow it was there even the police horses had wee santa hats on  There are always sales on the day after thanks giving so take your plastic  
P => The Hilton was great My dhter booked the Hilton for a  night stay as a gift to me and it was wonderful  She was concerned that it was not on quotthe milequot but it wasnt an issue at all  The L is very close and a cab ride was very reasonable   if you want to ride to the heart of things  There is also a free shuttle from the hotel to the Miracle Mile that ran hourly but only until  pm  If you are in Chicago to visit museums the location is great as they are walking distance  The hotel has the grandeur that you only find in older hotels which I love  In warmer months I am sure the location is a real plus as it is right across from the park  The room was beautiful and had two bathrooms   which was an added bonus  We had dinner in the Irish Pub and the food was great  I would definitely stay here again when in Chicago  
P => Christmas  Travelled with my  children and hubby to Chicago from  th    rd  Had the most wonderful stay at the Hilton the staff could not do enough for us  Booked and paid for a two double bed room with bathroom  When we arrived we were upgraded to a  double bedroom with  bathrooms and given a lake view  It must have been the irish accent The hotel was beautifully orated for christmas and it also had a great buzz about it  The health centre was great to relax in after a day of sights and shopping The food was lovely though a little on the expensive side  Free paper every day of our stay  Free shuttle bus to the mag mile every day from am   pm  Also received free drinks in Kitty OSheas when they heard I was from Limerick  The barmans relatives were from Clare  Buddy Guys Blues Bar is around the corner from the Hotel had a great night there and met the man himself the highlight of the trip for my husband  He sat and spoke with us for over an hour and signed many autographs for us  Overall we found the hotel the people shops food and sights fantastic  As Frank Sinatra says quot Its my kinda townquot  
P => Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Service We had a great experience at this hotel  The hotel is Huge The rooms were very clean well appointed and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park  The Staff was so nice and very helpfull  Donald at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance and on a Holiday weekend too  They were great seats and a reasonable price  He worked very hard for us to see that show They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration  This will be my first pick when I return in the spring  
P => Great Hotel Great Location The HIlton Chicago is a huge convention hotel with  rooms  Although built in the s the hotel has been nicely refurbished while keeping with period or  The public areas are well maintained  My room was very clean and comfortable with modern furnishings  The only negative thing I encountered was a buildup of rust around the bathtub drain that should have been cleaned up before the room was assigned to a guest The hotel has an extensive gym with a variety of workout equipment an indoor track and an indoor pool  The gym also has locker room facilities  The restaurant across from the front desk offers a very nice and extensive buffet  Luggage storage facilities are available for a  per bag fee if you have an afternoon flight  The hotel also has a business center with a copy machine and computers with Internet access but you must pay for use of this equipment Overall I had a very pleasant and comfortable three night stay  Every hotel employee I had contact with was pleasant friendly and helpful  If you plan ahead you can find sub  room rates during the quotoffquot and quotshoulderquot seasons which is a great deal for such a nice hotel  The hotel is located at the corner of Balbo and Michigan Ave  Although the hotel is south of the quotloopquot downtown and a variety of public transportation alternatives are within just a few minutes walk HOW TO GET TO THE HILTON ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTFrom OHARETake the Blue Line train towards Forest Park  Get off at the Jackson Street Station  Transfer to the Red Line train by walking down the stairs in the center of the platform look for the Red Line signs  Follow the tunnel to the Jackson Street Red Line Station and take a Red Line train towards Dan Ryan  Get off at the next stop Harrison Street  Take the escalator up to the fare gates and exit to the right  At the top of the stairs turn right and walk south on State Street one block to Balbo Street  Turn left and walk one block to Wabash Street  The entrance to the Hilton is on your right in the center of the block PUBLIC TRANSIT TO THE CHICAGO SIGHTSI recommend you purchase a visitor pass  The passes are a great deal and allow you unlimited use of buses subways and some trains  Day   Day   Day   Day  To the FIELD MUSEUM and SHEDD AQUARIUMExit the hotel via the Michigan Ave doors  Walk  block to Balbo Street and cross the street towards the lake  The bus shelter is on the other side of the street  Take the   bus  Its about a  minute bus ride  On a nice day you can walk to these museums in about   minutes TO the SCIENCE and INDUSTRY MUSEUMWalk to the bus stop described above and take the   or   bus  Its about a   minute bus ride to the museum TO the CHICAGO HISTORY MUSEUMWalk to the bus stop at Dearborn and Harrison about  blocks and take the   bus towards downtown  The bus stops across the street from the museum at North and Clark Streets  Alternatively you can take the Red Line train towards Howard and get off at the Clark Division Station  Exit via the Clark Street S E  exit  Walk up the stairs and the bus stop is right there  Or go left and walk four blocks up Clark Street to the museumTO the NAVY PIERWalk to the bus stop at Balbo and State Streets   blocks  Take the   quotNavy Pierquot bus TO the MAGNIFICENT MILE amp HANCOCK TOWERExit the hotel via the Michagan Ave doors turn left and walk to the corner of Balbo cross the street then cross Michigan Ave  The bus stop is a few steps from the corner  Take the   or   bus about a   minute ride Enjoy your stay in Chicago 
P => Great Stay at a First Class Hotel If you enjoy staying at a landk hotel with a bustling lobby private parties special events a busy lounge an international flavor and multiple good restaurants and dining options this is the place  The building is a full city block in length with  floors of guest rooms plus suites  We stayed for a long weekend Thurs through Sun  a couple of weeks before Christmas  Our room was in the towers portion of the hotel and it was quite large with two bathrooms  The room was clean the bed was great and the housekeeping staff was very attentive  We booked the option that includes a continental breakfast and afternoon appetizers on the concierge floor with the room rate but these services were only available on Sunday  Instead we were given coupons to use at the ground floor restaurant  This worked out fine in our case A complementary shopping shuttle leaves from the hotel on an hourly basis every day and takes guests up Michigan Ave  north of the river to the various department stores  You need to plan your day a little bit to make efficient use of the shuttle and hotels located on the Magnificent Mile are more convenient if you plan to spend all of your time shopping  They re also more expensive  Valet parking for your car costs   per day which seems to be the going rate downtown  You can self park within a couple blocks of the hotel for about   per day if you wish  The only irritating aspect of our stay involved internet access  Although wireless is available to hotel guests there is an hourly daily or weekly charge to use it  Considering that wireless internet is available for free at most coffee shops and even inexpensive hotels and motels this seems like a bit much  We had a great stay and plan to return again next year  
P => Nice place to stay I stayed for  days in the Hilton Chicago during the conference in    I have not spent much time in the hotel but like the gym and swimming pool that opens very early in the morning  My room for some reason has  bathrooms which will be good for  or more people  However I stay alone so it kinds of interesting room to have  The location is very closed to the Art Institute and the Millenium Park and is not too long a walk to Magnificent mile downtown area  The buffet breakfast is good with wide selection  The checkout kiosk allows you to print out your boarding pass and it is a nice touch  
P => Great Hotel but bad check out procedures The Chicago Hilton at  S  Michigan Ave  is a very elegant and comfortable hotel  We had a room with  beds and  full bathrooms  The beds were well equipped with several pillows very comfortable mattresses and a wonderful down comforter  Got great sleep in this hotel bed  The bathrooms were very nice as well  They had wonderful modern tile and looked very nice  I must admit I thought having  bathrooms for  people in a hotel was a bit extreme but my husband and I enjoyed each having our own bathroom with room to spread out our own toiletries  The only complaint about the hotel is that the check out procedures were annoying  We were given an quotinvoicequot under our door on the morning of check out that didnt show a zero balance  It showed no number at all and I wanted to make sure I wasnt charged anything that I shouldnt have been  We were given  options for checkout on the TV by telephone or self service kiosks in the lobby  I tried the TV which froze up while trying to locate my account twice  Then ided to try the lobby kiosks which were all off line  Finally just left my keys with the concierge and asked him to let registration know that we were checking out  Never got confirmation that I wasnt charged anything extra  Overall it took us over  minutes to try to check out between waiting for the TV waiting for an elevator and trying to get the kiosks to work  Twenty minutes of annoyance wasnt enough to ruin our stay though  Overall a great hotel Highly recommended  
P => Luxurious Stay This hotel was fantastic   everyone was helpful and nice but I think thats just a regular characteristic of native Chicago people Everything was very clean great food in the hotel and the location was fantastic  Short walk or short taxi ride to shopping and an awesome park right out front  
P => Good location busy and tired hotel Starting with the positives the hotel is well located with Grant Park out front facing onto Lake Michigan  Millenium Park with its sculptures is a short walk North there are a couple of good museums just to the South the L is only a couple of blocks away and the quotmagnificent milequot shopping district is a   min walk  Theres also a great blues bar   Buddy Guys House of Blues   right behind with live shows nightly The down side is that the hotel is huge and at least when I was there very busy   all the facilities were creaking at the seams with queues for breakfast not seats in the bars etc  The rooms were OK nothing exceptional and kinda worn  
P => Top notch hotel I ve stayed here twice once years ago and this time for a holiday shopping trip  I loved it both times  Elegant classy and filled with extras most downtown hotels do not offer the Hilton might be a little off the beat and path but it s well worth the cab rides  Both STANDARD rooms I ve stayed in have come with two bathrooms  Both times I was here with friends and that extra bathroom is a true luxury The staff is very pleasant and efficient and the range of services and amenities are some of the best in town  It would be hard to find a hotel that can beat this one for its class 
P => Just Beautiful We stayed here from    to   and had a wonderful time  The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in Kitty OSheas We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows  You can request other types if you have a problem with feathers  The large flat screen TV was very nice  Bath products were by Crabtree amp Evelyn and included shampoo conditioner mouthwash and bady lotion  Plenty of coffee was provided We drank and had snacks at Kitty OSheas  The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night  Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie Cheese Dip and CrispsThe location worked very well for us  We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street  And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about  each way  An excellent weekend getaway 
P => Fabulous Hotel The Hotel looked exactly like it does in the photos on the website  Absolutely beautifulStaff very friendly and our room was really lovely   very comfortable bed   exceptionally clean and  full bathroomsWe had room service and also ate in the restaurants   all very good We also took advantage of the free shuttle to downtown shopping  Very reliable pleasant driver If you are visiting Chicago   definitely stay here Highly recommended  
P => Par Excellence This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities  The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class  The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none  It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park  It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile  For Blues fans Buddy Guys Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel Highly recommended  
P => Terrific Customer Service Ive had the privilege of staying at Hiltons flagship hotel several times and this hotel lives up to its legends  Its stunning entrance and lobby contain miles of ble and priceless chandeliers  Its elegance is anticipated and hasnt failed to thrill me yet  The staff from check in to room service to check out exemplify that same elegance   they simply and obviously enjoy helping guests and go out of their way to show it  The guest rooms are well equipped and outstandingly comfortable beds can only be topped by incredible views of Lake Michigan  My son lives in Chicago and Im happy to visit him anytime  Oh   one more thing   dont miss the fried fish from one of their restaurants  I live in Wisconsin and we eat a lot of fish really a lot   but nothing Ive found lives up to this simple dish at the Hilton  
P => good hotel but reservations The Hilton is a massive hotel which  not be to everyones taste  The location about  minutes walk from the heart of the Magnificant Mile but opposite Grant Park would not be the best for some Pros Generally big rooms in good condition some rooms have small bathrooms others have good buffet breakfastlively Irish bar avoid it on Saturdays unless you like very loud live Irish folk musicAmazing top floor suites one has a grand piano bar pool table and  bedroomsMagnificent entrance quick modern lifts even have CNN showing in themConsLarge queues for taxis in the eveningslocation is not great for shopping and restaurants although Gioco  block away is very goodSize makes it impersonallong lines at check in at peak times 
P => Loved it We travel to Chicago once or twice a year and have stayed in many hotels but none so far has been as nice as the Hilton First we got  rooms  nights for night on Priceline Our double room  had  bathrooms and a beautiful view of the Field Museum and lake  The room was spacious and the beds and linens were ultra comfortable   nice large mugs for the coffee maker  Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries  A free computer for printing boarding passes  Spacious bars and lobbies to enjoy drinks  A delicious breakfast buffet with omelet station  An excellent workout room with a track many machines and a lap pool of about  meters at a good swimming temperature  Friendly service professional staff  We also had a chance to see a few celebrities which was fun  I know some prefer to be closer to quotthe Milequot but I simply loved this place and cant complain about one thing  Never had trouble getting a cab catching an elevator etc  I want to go back 
P => Fancy I love this hotel The main entrance is so grand and beautiful with the fresco on the ceiling  We were treated like royalty by the front desk who also upgraded us for free to a double bathroom and lakefront view  I usually stay with family in Chicago but I needed a hotel by Soldier Field for an early work meeting  The hotel bar not the pub but the other one made some great tinis just how I like them  I would definitely stay here again 
P => What  stars means not  Spent  days for a convention in ober  Hotel is well located near major attrctions particularly Soldier Field and museums  Building itself is old but well maintained and with timeless style Overall service is professional and well delivered with the scale of the hotel it is difficult to offer really personal service there are over  rooms Room was a European style doubledouble with two very nice bathrooms  My room was on Executive Floor which had its own elevator lounge area and probably some addtional room features such as a little coffee maker big TV and robes Executive lounge is simple and offers basic continental breakfast and snacks  Nothing to write home about  Alcohol is charged but bottled water and soft drinks are available throughout the day comp Kitty OSheas is affordable and convenient although its menu is very simple and the food mainly fried bar food   since it really is a bar  Hotel has several restaurants of varying style and price point generally good to very good overall Biggest problem for me was that they did not service my room for  hours despite calls to housekeeping for no apparent reason  When brought to the managers attention they came at once and volunteered to comp a nights stay as a courtesy  They had no explanation how my room got missed only that it was unintentional  I was satisfied with this repsonse Taxis to downtown are about  with tip bus is out in front of hotel and walking is viable option in good weather along Michigan Avenue I would stay here anytime I am in Chicago especially if you can get an internet rate  
P => Wonderful Hotel My Husband and I returned from our stay in Chicago on Monday ober   after staying there for a weekend birthday trip  After reviewing several hotels in the area I chose this one for my husband s birthday one because of the price and two because of the location  I must say the hotel was worth the money and the staff are excellent we had a problem with our first room just a hint if you don t like noise then room  is not for you every  minutes you can here a loud screeching noise from the air compressor turning on I called the front desk to request a new room a staffer immediately came to our room with a key to another room on the  floor and ready to move our bags no questions asked  This room was better with the view and it also had  gorgeous bathrooms which I loved and so did my husband I was able to take as much time as I needed to get ready in the mornings  The beds were very comfortable and it was nice to know that there were restaurants in the hotel to suit every person s taste buds  I found nothing in the hotel that I didn t like the only thing the hotel needs is a shuttle to and from the airports that would be a plus  We enjoyed staying within walking distance from Millennium park and the Museums and the best food places mainly pizza also catching the free trolley to the Navy Pier and other attractions  If you re looking for a reasonable breakfast I recommend the Savoy restaurant located next door to the hotel  We would definitely stay again 
P => Great hotel for the price Got a room for  of from Priceline  We took a train in from Michigan City and the hotel was only a  block walk once we got down there  We arrived just before  on a Friday and had no line at all checking in  The staff was very friendly and helpful  Our room had a fantastic view of the city and was plenty big for  of us  The beds seemed a little small but were very comfortable  Other than sleeping we didnt really spend a whole lot of time at the hotel but it fit our needs perfectly  I had never booked with priceline before and the only problem I had was trying to get a room w beds but after  phone calls and  emails I finally got my request approved  The hotel also tried to charge us for a bottle of water from the mini bar that we never took but a simple phone call got that fixed Overall a beautiful hotel great beds great price   would definitely stay there again 
P => Nice hotel but not great  My wife and I stayed at the Hilton over a weekend while visiting friends  Overall the hotel is nice but it does have a few bad quirks  First off the location of the hotel is pretty good  Right across from Grant Park and only about a  minute walk from Michigan Avenue shopping  I was disappointed we had to settle for a room with  double beds  However I knew ahead that just because we requested a king bed didnt necessarily mean wed get it  We did get a park and water view which was nice  The beds are very comfortable the TV is nice and the room was very clean overall  The bathroom was nice and clean but the handles on the sink were pointed in different directions  It was no big deal but I thought it looked sort of trashy  Also I didnt like how much money the hotel charged for everything  A  bottle of water in the room soft drinks for  and  per day for parking Typical prices for big hotels I guess  I just drank tap water and we parked in the Grant Park South garage for  per day  I guess we cant complain too much since we got our room for  per night on Priceline but I wouldnt pay full price to stay here  
P => Great stay Friend and I were in town for Lollapalooza  Huge room on executive floor    beds and  bathrooms  I have to say it again    BATHROOMS  the location of the hotel is great Its truly one of the grand hotels  Im happy to see the hotel restored to its grandeur  there were several things going on in the hotel but elevator waits were kept to a minimum thanks to the  or so elevators in the lobby  Hilton Honors check in was a breeze  executive lounge was a bit busy at times but a great feature  The breakfast was pretty good standard cold cereals bagels pastries coffee tea juice  The small water bottles made bringing several bottles back to your room quite easy  Employees were cheerful and comical   which is a great way to start the day  Had no issues with AC   there was a note to use caution when opening windows as the lack of screens allows mosquitoes to enter the room  room service every night   food was FRESH hot and delicious  Had several options for those that have a healthier lifestyle ie fruit cup instead of french fries and plenty of snackables for everyone  I would stay here again 
P => Great We stayed here over the summer for  nights and had a great time A huge twin room with  bathrooms was perfect for me and my friend and made our stay very comfortable The hotel is massive so prepare yourself to do some exploring but the staff were always helpful in pointing you to your destination  Surprisingly for a large hotel and part of a chain they really make you feel welcome Location wise this was perfect for us right opposite Grant Park and about a  minute walk from the main shoppin area As an added benefit there was a pretty good Irish Bar downstairs where you could get a ent burger and a beer  
P => Fantastic stay Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed  Check in was quick easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check in time  We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant  It made getting ready to go out much quicker The hotel location is great opposite the park which is a must see  Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave  Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping  For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant  For evening entertainment Kitty OSheas is a must  Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever  I would have taken it home if I could Definately made for a good nights sleep  
P => Quite an experience I stayed there on tember th  as I was in Chicago to watch BRASIL play the United States in soccer at Soldier Field  BRASIL    U S   So the hotels location was ideal as Soldier Field is just a few blocks away  I lived in Chicago where I learned that this hotel was historic classy and expensive  Therefore going back and staying there was a treat  Obviously I was able to do so thanks to a Hotwire deal  The hotel is clean safe and luxurious  Inexplicably I was given a room with two beds and two bathrooms  But I did not complain  And I was able to collect a double ration of Hilton quality toiletries which made a nice gift for my wife One note of caution parking at this hotel is expensive  But it is expensive throughout downtown  There are public lots nearby so you  want to comparison shop  Since I was staying one night I opted to keep my car in house  
P => Very nice Hotel We stay at Hilton for  nights last ch  It was a pleasant stay  We got a large room with  double beds and  bathrooms The TV was Ok a  CRT Flat Screen  The coincierge was very friendly when we need  The room was very cleaned when we arrived we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also The main Hall is beautiful The breakfast is charged  dollars kinda expensive The internet access WiFi is charged  dollarsday Pros Low rate price huge rooms close to attractions at Loop close to metro station Cons Expensive breakfast Internet access charged Tip When leaving the building always use the Michigan Av exit  Its a great view  
P => Hilton Chicago was great My wife and I had a great stay at this hotel  Dont be scared by overly critical reviews  We booked through Priceline for  per night  Definitely worth the deal  For over  though I would probably look to stay at a hotel centered in the Mag mile unless you are a runner like me and LOVE the location directly across from Grant Park  Also this location keeps you out of the Times Square like crowds around the Mag mile hotels  Room was great  Location across from parks and lake was great  Free shuttle to shopping was great  Dont miss Yolk for breakfast a few blocks to the South  If you go see Wicked fantastic be sure to have dinner at Petterinos nearby  The food and service were excellent well worth the   Park Grill at Millenium Park was also a great dinner  great food in a chic but relaxed atmosphere  best scallops Ive ever had  Trout and Kobe burger were also great  
P => ent place to stay This is one of the quotfamous  hotelsquot in Chicago others being the Drake and Palmer House  Location is good although a little far south along Grant Park if you are wanting to do mostly Mag Mile activities  But it is a short walk to many train connections  Hotel is beautiful lobby and ballrooms are legendary  I got a cheap  room on Priceline on the start day of a major convention  They did give me a nice lake view framed with SheddAdler to the right and Burnham Harbor in front of me  Room was fine bathroom spacious and quiet overall  Only complaint was that a lamp base was broken on the vanity next to my bad which should have been cht  Room as clean enough and as an Honors member there is free bottled water not chilled though in the room  If you get a good price and plan activities in the LoopSouth LoopMag Mile or points west and south this is a pretty good choice  Food in Kitty OSheas Irish pub off the lobby was good and service friendly  Pretty pricey though no surprise there  Chicago was great as always 
P => Loved This Hotel My stay was quick but awesome  After a long day seeing a substantial line at check in was a bit of a groaner but then i saw the self serve kiosks  i was checked in with keys in hand in under  minutes  in the morning i was able to check out on the TV in my room  the hotel is a beautiful historic landk with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its  origins  The bed was FABULOUSLY comfortable  i wish i could live there  they have many rooms wtih  bathrooms  i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didnt know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms  talk about squeals of delight  that was about  years ago in virginia beach  i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms but its the first time ive seen this since  what a great feature 
P => Large rooms  Baths I got an incredible deal at the Hilton in downtown Chicago  What a great hotel The room had two beds and two baths Great location  People were friendly and the concierge was very helpful  My only complaint is that parking is outrageously expensive but Grant Park public parking lot is only a few blocks down  I highly recommend it especially if you get a good deal  
P => Truly a Grand Hotel We got really lucky on Priceline and got the Chicago Hilton  Truly a historic vel  We were in awe when we walked in since we werent expecting much  You should get a tour  We were lucky   the manager greeted us in the morning and kindly offered a personal tour  The swimming pool is very nice free and so is the gym day  Our room was just OK  The beds were small   we asked for  doubles  It caters to conventions so I think the double beds might be undersized to accommodate those who want to share rooms  Also The room was quite warm and we couldnt get it to cool  But this place is an experience and right across from Grant Park  Memorable time 
P => Wonderful stay We have stayed in this hotel for three nights  It is located at Michigan Avenue  Near to the Buckinham Fountain  The Sears Tower Millennium Park Magnificent Mile State Street and the El ar at walking distance of the hotel  When walking is to far public transportation can be found near to the hotel The hotel was excellent  A very friendly staf  The room was clean the beds were okay and the bathroom was perfect  The pool was great  The view from the jacuzzi was unforgetable  We saw the Sears Towers from the jacuzzi We liked the atmosphere and the grandeur of the hotel We had the perfect stay in Chicago  
P => Fabulous hotel We stayed here for three nights earlier in the month and were not disappointed We were allocated a huge room with two very comfortable large beds and a well appointed bathroom containing lovely soft towels  The room had a vellous view of Lake Michigan showing the Navy Pier to the left and Soldier Field to the right which was particularly good for watching the fireworks one evening The breakfast buffet had everything you would want to eat to start the day and the food in the Kitty OSheas was very good value The only downside were the lifts which you had to wait ages for  At the time we were visiting there was a large contingent of accountants on their annual conference so the hotel was very full which probably didnt help Taking everything into account we would certainly stay at this hotel again in the future and would recommend it without reservation  
P => Ok hotel   awful lifts Generally I enjoyed my stay here but the major down side was the lifts  Getting to the room was easy enough   getting a lift back down from the th floor not so much Although it looks like there are plenty not all lifts go to every floor  This meant that we had to wait  minutes one day just to get to the lobbyThe hotel itself is huge   plenty to see and do with a nice little shop and a good value breakfast buffet  Staff were friendly and accommodating and the location was good for museums transport and the tour which stops just outside  Also stopping outside is the airport shuttle   very handy and a flat fare so no worrying about the awful traffic raising your cab fareThere is a fitness centre and nice sized swimming pool though a long way off olympic sized as is quoted in some of the information I saw but the day I went it was full of families flaunting the rules with small infants in the spas and diving into the lanes   I didnt bother to go again  
P => Beautiful hotel   fantastic stay Our room was gorgeous All that we requested was a king bed and we were given a large room overlooking Lake Michigan We could see Navy Pier and Soldier Field from our window The bed was VERY comfortable Our room also had two TVs a couch armchair desk bar with sink and refrigerator locked minibar we did not request the key and fabulous bathroom The bathroom was stocked with namebrand shampoo and lotion as well as soft towels The staff was always friendly and cabs were always waiting outside the hotel  Its walking distance to millenium park and a lot of restaraunts  We also visited  of the onsite bars and had excellent service at both  Prices are a little high but relative to the area Downtown Chicago If you are looking for a relaxing stay   Id recommend staying here The only semi negative was a long line at the front desk  We waited in it for check in but used the automated machine for express check out with no problems  
P => Great Priceline Deal   Large slightly aged room  The Hilton Chicago has beautiful common areas and ball rooms  But the guest rooms are a bit older  We upgraded for night to a huge  bedroom suite bedroom plus main sitting room with a lake view  When you are sold a lake view you will be able to see the lake but dont be fooled like we were and expect a full  degree view Like I said the room or and bathroom were nice but a bit aged  The bed was quite comfortable though and there were lots of windows  We were at the end of a hall and were not at all disturbed by any noise  Room wise we really dont have any complaints but dont have anything to rave about either  OK  Two complaints  The bathroom sink did not drain well  But the bathroom had a large frosted window that let in lots of wonderful natural light  Also my wife found lots of spiders   in our room The guy that checked us in was very nice but gave us misinformation about finding late night dining  The rest of the staff was quite pleasant except for the very grumpy gentlemen that work the baggage check counter  Watch out for them  Even a nice tip hardly evoked any friendliness We only had one meal at the hotel  We ate at Buckinghams  The service was friendly but VERY slow and the food while tasty ended up making us both ill  We complained about it at check out and the hotel manager did credit us back for half of the dining bill which was nice The hotel is in a ent location right next to Grant Park  But for most everything including getting food we had to walk quite a way  There are other hotels in slightly more convenient locations such as Palmer House Chicago Recommendations We love Chicago in the summer There are so many great events  If I had to recommend one thing to do there it would be to rent bikes  The city is flat with excellent walking and bike paths for navigating the parks and lake front  The fireworks are fun too  Watch them from Navy Pier or next to Alder Planetarium or from a charter sail boat  We really enjoyed sailing with Windy City Sailing Also check out the free dance lessons and dancing in Grant Park  Just arrive early so as not to miss the start of the lesson and grab some chairs If you want to grab a cheap bite to eat close to the Hilton Chicago there is a good little bar called South Loop Club at the corner of Balboa and State which is open until late  The best steakhouse is Chicago Chop House  Make a res  and eat there We took the Blue Line to the Loop and then a cab from there but probably could have walked  It was fun taking the train and we avoided traffic and saved some money For a great deal on pricey Chicago hotels use Priceline com  We have had great success  Check out BiddingforTravel com for bidding tips  
P => Loved it Beautiful Front desk was great Rooms were immaculate    all in all a great stay 
P => Great Hotel in a Great City We booked our stay through Priceline com and got a great deal  We were only staying one night and we had our  year old with us  At check in we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan  It was beautiful  The suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini fridge which we didnt need but if we were staying longer it would have been a godsend  This hotel is in close proximity with Grant Park which has the beautiful Buckingham Fountain  We walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed    but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it this isnt the one  We ended up eating at the Irish Pub inside the hotel Kitty OSheas which has great food  We have stayed here before and always end up eating here  There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum Shedd Aquarium Soldier Field and Navy Pier  They  not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window  Overall we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton  Our th stay The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel      dollars a night is kind of ridiculous  
P => Not enough truly nonsmoking rooms The Chicago Hilton is a ent place but they do not have enough truly nonsmoking rooms  When I got there in the evening shortly after sunset they had only two quotnonsmokingquot rooms left  Both had the smell of smoke in them and the less stinky of the two had no bed it was on the executive floor and was the living room of a larger suite  It took the hotel  hour to get me a rollaway bed and another   hours to get me pillows and a blanket  They had claimed that the rollaway was as good as a regular bed at the front desk as well as promised that it would be complimentary  In reality it was actually more of low sofabed quality and I had to go in person to the front desk at checkout to get the charge for it removed  To their credit the front desk did give me a complimentary breakfast coupon and were generally very helpful  In addition the location is convenient for the Park buses and not that far from the El station  Echoing one of the other reviewers there were spiders outside the window even on the  floors and the outside of the windows was not that clean  They did charge for WiFi access Basically this hotel needs to enforce nonsmoking in their rooms  As it stands there are not even prominently placed quotNo Smokingquot signs and no quotThere will be a  cleaning fee if you smoke in the roomquot signs  If the hotel fixes their smoking problems it would be a solid   hotel  But as of now I can only give it  stars  
P => Got a great deal on priceline and I was impressed            I was worried because of the reviews I read on here but boy was I shocked  I got  nights for   a night on priceline and I got a double room with  bathrooms  The rooms were very clean and trust me I am picky  I thought by looking at the pictures here on tripadvisor that they would be old and dated but the pics dont do the hotel any justice  The staff was nice  The parking was a little high but I parked in garage for     across the street  Most of all I loved not having to share a bathroom with my husband  
P => ok but nothing to write home about  I stayed here when going to a concert at CharterOne Pavilion because it was farily close by  It was a nice room especially the bed  Lovely bathroom  BUT Parking is much too expensive  And its lovely that this hotel is pet friendly its just not so great when the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors yappy dogThe worst of all is that they charge for late check outs  SO tacky  Id stay here again if I was in town for a conference  
P => One of the worst hotels in the world OK  So I needed a hotel for a somewhat reasonable rate and everyone on here was quite kind  So I booked it  Well we get in on Tuesday eve late  y and there is one person at reception and simply crazy goings on in the lobby  Low class people  White trash Others you can figure out for yourself  It was like a circus  If I were  this might have been fun  Sorry been there done that We go to our room  A jr  suite  Well you get off on the floor and its dimly lit  Bordellos are better lit than this joint  And it stinks  We get to our room and it smells like fee aampamp and cigarettes  Mindyou this is a non smoking room  The room is dimly lit spiders are hanging outside the windows the furniture is old the carpet reeks of wet feet and I dont know what else  I cant go on  Simply DO NOT STAY HERE  If they pay you to stay here say NO THANK YOU Absolute pit  They should implode it and start over  What was once a flagship hotel is now a hole  Period  
P => Convention paradise We were at a company convention in the Chicago Hilton  A massive hotel with many function rooms and facilities  The rooms were amazingly large and nice for a city centre hotel  Conveniently located on Michigan and close to the Millenium Park and other attractions  Too big to call anything other than functional  Food was bland  
P => Nice place to stay Booked this using hotwire and got a good deal  It was an enjoyable few nights and I would highly recommend it from the facilities available in the hotel to its location  It was a short walk to Millenium park and a short walk to the El system  
P => Elegant but old and it does show I was in town for a conference at McCormick Place btw its about an  cab ride to McCormick  tip  The hotel is BIG and the lobby areas are quite posh almost as nice as the resort hotels in Las Vegas  Service was very polite in that upper crust snooty sort of way and the Concierge guys were really helpful in finding restaurants and provided maps of the downtown area I got a room on the st floor  There are  banks of elevators  set goes up to the th floor another set really for   and the third set for   Executive Floors   A colleague was on the th floor in a smoking room FYI the floor hallways are quotnon smokingquot but I nearly choked on the cigarette smell embedded into the walls  You could even SEE the smoke clouds in the hallways The bedroom and bathroom were both rather small  However you could tell the hotel was doing everything it could to make it more quotluxuriousquot  Big NIIIICE king bed  Oversized TV  Gold plated fixtures in the bathroom  But still the water pressure was really weak the air conditioner was stuck in a corner and not the most effective e g  no digital temperature setting If you want to spend a lot of time in your hotel room    find somewhere else  If youre looking for a very comfortable bed and an upscale brand in a GREAT location right on Michigan Ave then you can choose the Chicago Hilton  
P => Excellent hotel and staff An excellent hotel  Luxurious and the staff are very efficient  Despite having to wait a while to check in the staff were so quick when I did get the desk that I ended up forming a very positive first impression  The hotel is BIG however it is easy to get around  The room was lovely and spacious and I got an upgrade to one which overlooked the museum area of the city  Stay here   no hesitation  Unless you dont like very big hotels  
P => Very Friendly Staff We stayed for the Blues Festival which was happening within walking distance of the hotel over at Grant Park  Our stay was very nice The hotel was clean the staff was very friendly and the pool hot tub sauna and tanning bed were all very enjoyable  The lemonade service in the lobby in the afternoon was a nice added touch tooOur room was a regular room with two double beds and had two bathrooms on each side of the room which was VERY NICE to have as an added convenience  The toiletries were all Crabtree amp Evelyn so it was the good stuff The hotel itself is beautiful especially when you realize how old it is and how much history it has within its walls  The Grand Ballroom would be a perfect place for a fancy party or wedding reception with its gold gilded ornamentation drapes and crystal chandeliers The property is also easily accessible to the red line via the Harrison stop  Or if you dont want to take the subway you can hop on the complimentary shopping shuttle that will take you down to all the shops along Magnificent Mile A few improvements would be to allow complimentary use of the exercise equipment to all guests apparently there is an extra fee to use the gym equipment  I would have also liked for the pool and hot tub to remain open until at least midnight  It closes at pm  I think a free continental breakfast would have really added an extra nice touch to our stay as well  
P => Great Hotel well worth the money This hotel is in a ideal location  It is a really lovely clean hotel with good bars and resturants  We had a really enjoyable stay here  
P => Great Hotel Great Rates I have stayed at the Chicago Hilton and Towersor Hilton Chicago as it is now called more times then I can countI will agree with some posters who said that the hotel can be pricey with some things as an earlier poster said that is why you hit Walgreens for munchies Neighborhood eateries for meals  Having said that I must disagree on a somethings I read complaints on the closeness of the hotel to shopping and all   that you must take the el subway or a taxi  Have any of you EVER taken the complimentry hotel shuttle It drops you off at or close to major shopping and museums  a tip to the driver and you are on your way As for the rooms themselves they have always been beyond lovely  I do get somewhat annoyed when I get to look at a rooftop and not the lake but we cant always get our way can weAs for the staff   I have always been suprised how nice the staff have been to me when I have stayed there  A lot of times when you stay at a hotel like this they are snotty beyond belief I have never experienced that here I guesstimate that since  I have stayed at Hilton Chicago at least  be  times  I cant always afford it but when I plan to come to Chicago it is the first hotel I look into  
P => Look Elsewhere Nice hotel overall   but you can find an equally nice or nicer hotel with more amenities and spend far less money  When I arrived I was surprised at how nice the rooms where but SHOCKED at the prices Drinks from the vending machines cost   Coffee packets for in room brewing systems are   for a single serving pod It also cost me   for seven minutes of internet  There was a bottle of water next to the television on the dresser that had a   price tag Im surprised they didnt charge for ice in the ice machines  The hotel boasts four great restaurants but these prices are also radically high  My friend and I ate dinner at Kitty OSheas in the hotel and were surprised when we realized that beers cost   a piece This is more expensive than beers at a White Sox game  Chicago is a relatively cheap city  There is no reason to charge those prices  One would expect a first rate hotel like the Hilton to at least offer free internet access I know that the Holiday Inn does I also must complain about the unfriendliness of the staff  Several of the employees were arrogant and just plain rude  When I asked for the key to the mini bar the attendant asked for my I D  which is fine but then insisted that I wasnt  Im   It turns out she was reading the expiration date on my license instead of the birthdate  Then she claimed that my I D  looked fake  I guess shes never seen a Texas drivers license before  I was in town for a professional conference and didnt appreciate being treated like a kid trying to sneak into an R rated movie  Speaking of kids for the first few days of my stay the hotel was crawling with teenagers There was some sort of High School Student Government convention going on in the hotel  They were everywhere Goofing around with the elevators sleeping on the couches in the lobbies running down the halls screaming and giggling at am Each group of teenagers was followed by equally troublesome adult chaparones that screamed and yelled orders at the kids  It was hem  I realize that it wasnt the hotels fault but it was an annoyance  The hotel also hosted a local prom on Saturday night  The nearest subway stop was closed and I was forced to either walk five blocks to the next stop or take a cab  The concierge informed me that this particular subway stop always seems to close down on the weekends If you must stay at the hotel if youre attending a conference for instance then here are some tips stop at Walgreens which is only a couple of blocks away and buy drinks and snacks to stock your hotel room  Also dont eat at the hotel instead eat at the eleven city diner or any of the other restaurants located nearby  
P => Great for Cave Lovers Months prior to my  night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light facing an open view not a close building  The reservation was made through a conference travel agency  I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check in the clerk noted it in my record  She told me it would be difficult to find but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me  I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers tucked into a very dark corner facing a wall of rooms  I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request but to  sit tight  and someone would call me  No one did  Further calls yielded similar results  At one point I was told I could have a  parlor room  with a sofa bed at a reduced rate but I could not go see the room before committing to moving  That s real hospitality for you  Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room  I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds  The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had  bathrooms  Other than that it was tight quarters with a tiny closet two uncomfortably low chairs at the desk and in a dark corner  Light fixtures didn t do much to brighten things up  Since I was here at a conference I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid day calls and e mail but instead I got a cave  Consequently I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago conference or not I will absolutely stay at another hotel  There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of  inside tower  rooms places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service  Shame on the Chicago Hilton  
P => Good hotel for conference goers not tourists I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for six nights because it was one of the listed hotels for a conference I was attending at McCormick Place  The Hilton Chicago is one of the oldest hotel in Chicago and in one word I would describe it as quotstately quot Chandeliers elegant staircases ble front desk etc The hotel is quite huge so if you are expecting attentive and a personable atmosphere from your hotel  you might not get it at the Hilton Chicago  My room had  double beds on the st floor it was well furnished and clean  But the minibar reminds you the best things in life are not always free   but can be quite expensive  Bottled water was  As other reviewers have mentioned   everything at the Hilton Chicago comes at a premium  water phone calls internet   take how much you would expect to pay for those conveniences and triple it  The location is not the most convenient about a   minute walk to city center  but you are on a regular bus route and near a subway line Harrison Street metro and within walking distance of millennium park  If you are attending a conference and need a hotel near McCormick the Hilton is not a bad place to stay  But if you are into sightseeing and on a budget I would recommend a more central location 
P => good time in Chi ca go Stayed here for a week in late il early   Hotel is a historic Hilton flagship  Located near lakefront park financial district and downtown schoolsuniversities  Easy  mile walk to Magnif  mile area  Impressive or with Michigan Ave entrance lobby and staircase leading to ballrooms  Rooms are neat two beds and two bathrooms  Lots of street level pubs bookstores student theaters museums and shops nearby  Safe at night lots of students and people out and about  Joggers walkers and bikers out along the lakefront in the AM  I was there during the week M R  I would like to bring my wife and teenagers next time  Ive been a few places Chicago is a well kept secret  
P => Luxurious but    Beautiful Hotel at fair price however be warned all the extras dont come cheap  Parking Internet MiniBar and Restauants are very expensive  They also charge additional for the exercise room  Surprized I wasnt charged  to flush the toilet Thankfully lots of local cheap eats  And right on subway line too  
P => Good Business and Convention Hotel I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for a conference in the beginning of il  My conference was at the Palmer House and the Hilton Chicago served as the overflow hotel  I found the rooms to be very small but for a single traveler the space was more than adequate  As a Hilton Honors member I was given coupons for  small bottle of water from the mini bar Free of charge and I did take advantage of that service Otherwise I found that this Hilton tends to charge for almost everything  For example there was a note in my key packet at check in that there was a hour charge for late checkouts I have rarely encountered this during my travels and they charge day for use of the gymfitness center unless you are a Hilton Honors Silver member or higher  The hotel is in a bit of a isolated spot on Michigan Avenue  It was approximately a  minute walk to the center of the Loop  The walk was perfectly safe during the day but I felt uncomfortable with it at night  The area is not unsafe but it is a bit isolated with a lot of parking lots and office buildings surrounding the hotel  
P => Older Room Beautiful Facilities Good Location I stayed here for  nights in conction with a conference  Its a huge hotel with excellent conference facilities  I love the fact that the hotel is close to the symphony the Field Museum and the Art Museum  The public spaces are very quotgrandquot and historic The main issue I had was my room was quite outdated  The furniture was old the bed was old even the bedspreads were dated looking not the nice stylish ones that you see on the Chicago Hilton website  The workspace was terrible   the chair was very old and could not be adjusted  It was way too short and very narrow so it was uncomfortable to work for long periods of time  Since I do so much work on the laptop while traveling this alone would definitely keep me from coming back  But many people wont really mind this so if you dont mind the possibility of getting an older dated room then this hotel might be just fine for you  BTW Im a Hilton Silver Honors member so I dont think they stuck me in a dated room bc I was a low frequency guest     That tells me that perhaps a lot of their rooms are dated 
P => love love loved it Old world grandeur is all very well   and the Chicago Hilton has this in abundance   but what really counts is comfort peace and quiet and excellent service  Thankfully this hotel outshone itself in these areas much to my surprise  I had no idea this place was so big and when I first arrived I braced myself for the conference hotel service one comes to expect  I could not have been more wrong check in was swift and efficient despite it being busy  My room was quiet warm and very comfortable  It took me be all of  mins to feel completely relaxed  On both nights of my trip as i was traveling alone I ordered room service and treated myself   the wait staff were punctual attentive and the food was lovely  I really felt like I was staying somewhere beautiful and historic but without paying a price for cutting qualty and service  Ill be going back to the Hilton again when I am next lucky enough to visit Chicago  Thank you Hilton for a wonderful break 
P => Hilton Chain on its Way to the Landfill The Hilton Chicago on  South Michgan is a total dump  The entire staff seems completely demoralized  From the moment you arrive and find no bellman at the door to the moment you TRY to check into your room and find someone who speaks no English TRYING to set you up and does so perfectly in the wrong room back to front desk for round two of desperately seeking asylum The restaurants have ent food  The service like everywhere else in the hotel is horrible  The Pavillion sits nearly empty yet upon arrival the guest is treated as though the place were bursting with customers and finding just one seat causes potential collapse of all seating limits  The rooms are strangely arranged with furniture smack dab in front of windows  Getting the room cleaned required several calls to Housekeeping each time hearing the familiar refrain quotIm sorry but there has been a MISCOMMUNICATION regarding cleaning your room quotThe entire hotel exudes a sadness that makes me never want to return to this hotel or any Hilton Hotel anywhere I am a shareholder in the Hilton Corporation  Not for long  I had heard from many people how the Hiltons had scraped the staff beyond the bone and they were right  The place really is the dump my friends described  I can no longer support financially or socially this institution I do think that tart Paris has held the lantern for things to come  
P => Favorite Hotel in Chicago We stayed at the Hilton over St  Patricks day  I have a child at the University of Chicago so I am in Chicago a lot and have tried about  different hotels  This was my favorite so far  I liked it for a lot of the reasons some people dont like it  I prefer larger buildings that I can roam around in rather than boutique hotels  Especially in a city like Chicago where roaming around outside isnt always comfortable with the wind the rain and the cold and the panhandlers  The lobby floor has a very long central hall and while we were eating dinner on St  Patricks day a bagpipe band came ching down the hall  It was very entertaining  I prefer to be about a  to  minute walk away from the center of everything rather than right in the middle of everything  I prefer museums over shopping so being near the museums rather than in the middle of the Magnificent Mile shopping area was a plus for me  I like blues music and one of the best blues clubs Buddy Guys Legends is right next door to the hotel  And I like open spaces so staying in a room in the front of the hotel with a magnificent view of Grant park the museum campus the Navy pier and the lake was wonderful  We were lucky to have extremely clear weather and the views were stunning both in the day and at night when the Navy pier and the Museum Campus lights up  We watched the St  Patricks Day parade from our room  The key is to rent a suite since all the suites are in the front of the building  Pricey but worth it  We had a suite with two bedrooms and four full bathrooms for  people  Great for getting up and out quickly in the morning Other great things about this hotel  It is right on Michigan Avenue so you can come off Lakeshore Drive and you are right there without having to fight the city traffic  You can self park your own car in a garage attached to the main building so you have easy access to your car without having to go through a valet service  It was very easy going from here to Hyde Park which we did frequently  The building is beautiful and has  restaurants to choose from plus a lounge  It is a  to  minute walk to the museums and the center of the loop but I prefer that for the peace and quiet at night  Plus I need the exercise  The public spaces in the hotel are beautiful to look at as the pictures on the website show  Another nice feature is that for a reasonable amount of money more you can choose to check out at PM or PM I would definately sign on online to be a Hilton Honors member if you stay here because you get a quicker check in and other benefits  The have a arate front desk for Hilton Honors members  Plus Hilton Honors is a free This isnt going to be everyones favorite hotel especially shoppers and people who want to be in the center of the Loop or the Magnificent Mile  But for me it was the right fit Two things I would suggest  The suites come with a refrigerator and a sink but no microwave  Also there is no DVD player attached to the TV  I would add both  We did have fun watching quotThe Fugitivequot with Harrison Ford on a large laptop computer though  The Chicago Hilton was one of the main settings for this film  
P => Great location   elegant hotel I recently attended a conference that was being hosted at this hotel in   and spent a  nights here  This was my first time at the Chicago Hilton  I must say that the hotel is very elegant and has a very  old school  charm to it  All the ballrooms are huge and the second floor reception area is beautiful  That being said I felt that the sheer size of the hotel made it a little bit impersonal  Here s a sumy of my experience Check In  There was a long line when I got there but the line moved fast and I didn t have to wait too long  The lady at the counter was very professional but seemed impersonal yes I used that word again  Room  The room itself was a little small plus I got stuck with a view of the AC vent and the bathroom really needed to be reated  Again it reminded me of the older hotel rooms of the s a little  The room itself was tastefully orated and the bed was comfortable although the king bed was much smaller than any king I ve seen  Food   I must say that I was very disappointed with the food at this hotel  First of all I called for room service at pm one night and they told me they were closed  So I tried the Pavilion and the food there was mediocre to say the least  I tried Kitty O Sheas one night but that place gets quite crowded and it gets smoky as the night progresses so I didn t stick around too long  There aren t many other restaurants in walking distance so it s best to take a cab and explore the city for great places to eat  I went to a place called The MK Restaurant which I would highly recommend  I eat out in NY all the time and have seldom found placed outside NY that I am that impressed by this place was one Location   I absolutely loved the location of this hotel The park is right in front and the hotel is in walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions  They even provide a free shuttle to the Magnificent Mile  If there s one really good reason to pick this hotel I d say it s the location  It s not in the middle of things and therefore it s not noisy yet you can get almost anywhere walking or in a  minutes cab ride Overall I had a pleasant stay at the hotel  There is a lot to do and see in Chicago  This hotel is well located and the d coroverall feel of the hotel is elegant so it s always nice returning back to the hotel  One thing to keep in mind is that the hotel hosts a lot of conventions so it s always very busy and there are people everywhere  
P => Older but Elegant We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for  days in ch   It was an older hotel but well taken care of  The lobby and ballrooms were very elegant  Many of the rooms have view   either of the city or of Lake Michigan   but many do not  For example our view was of the hotel buidling   the hotel exterior is not quotflatquot so some rooms have views of other rooms  See the photo below to see what I mean The Hilton was in a prime location for museums   within walking distance of the Field Museum of Natural History Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium  Hint   admission to all  plus more is   with a Chicago CityPass  The Hilton offers a quotShopping Shuttlequot to downtown and the Magnificent Mile making  or  stops along the way  It does this every hour from am   pm and is free  The Hilton is also across from the bus stop the you would use to go to the Museum of Science and Industry The Chicago Hilton has  main restaurants   Kitty OSheas Irish Buckinghams AmericanSteak dinner only and Pavilion American  hours  I was surprised that sodacoffetea was more than  at the Pavilion The quotExotic Fruitquot dessert at Buckinghams was fantastic   a huge plate of exotic fruit with chocolate souce for dipping   well worth the  price and large enough to share  The th quotrestaurantquot is the Lakeview Lounge which serves Starbucks coffee in the mornings and alcohol at night  All in all we enjoyed our visit  Since our trip involved more museums and site seeing than shopping we were pleased with the location  
P => Great price good location and amazing comfort We booked through a UK website so got a very cheap rate for a long weekend over St  Patricks Day  Our room was on the nd floor and was fantastic definately one of the best hotels Ive stayed at  The beds are very comfortable the room came equipped with mini bar large TV with games console clock radio etc  Views were great  Housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful Only a couple of slightly offputting things     The location is a little out of the way for downtown be a  to  minute walk to hit the main spots  Also the hotel is exceptionally busy and although there was several check in desks when we checked in on a Friday night they only had  open meaning there was a long queue  Im not sure the bar and restaurant facilities are adequate for a hotel of that size so the lobby was always crowded with overflow  Business center is very expensive at the time of our stay it was out of order but no one indicated this so we swiped our credit cards and only found out later Otherwise its a little pricey but worth it   and if two are sharing a room its an easier on the pocket experience you wont forget 
P => Bravo Hilton Flew from DC Dulles to Midway Airport Would fly into OHare next time and arrived at this beautiful hotel in time for dinner  The doorman took our bags from the taxi and walked us into the lobby  Check in was a breeze and so was getting info about Chicago  Staff was very helpful and courteous  My  year old son and I got away for Columbus day weekend and Hilton made it a fantastic trip Hotel has a beautiul layout good Irish barrestaurant on site there are others but we didnt eat at them and rooms are elegant and well equipped with coffee maker bar and  bathrooms I reserved the room on the Hilton website and paid  a night faced a building no view It is not within walking distance of much very few restaurants but it was close to the Bears Soldiers Stadium a museam saw King Tut and an aquarium  All great sites to see  Room service is a little pricey but not out of the ordinary  Had a great full Sunday morning breakfast for about   A short taxi ride to everything and Chicago awaits  The double ker bus stops in front of the hotel and is well worth the fare which was  for both of us  Check out was effortless by the time we were ready to leave for the airport in the morning  If youre in town and a Bears game is scheduled I recommed going  Even though we waited for  mins in line for available tickets it was worth it  Chicago Bears fans are loyal and their excitement for their players is contagious  Paid  for each ticket that we were told were obstructed view which turned out to be  yard line  rows up  No obstructions  Beautoful city and wonderful people  When we go back to Chicago we will stay there again  Hilton at its best  
P => Georgeous Hotel we stayed at the Hilton Chicago from nd uary    th uary   Let me tell you this is a huge oppulent hotel in the perfect location overlooking the park and water Staff are very helpful  The room was spacious and amentities were of a high standard as you would expect  If you want to use the mini bar in your room you need to get a key from front desk though Paid movies are available  There is a coffee machine in room but no fridge just an ice bucket  We had a king size bed which was so comfy  There is a writing desk and chair in the room as well as a big screen TV  Only complaint was the party next door that didnt stop till well after am  They had no respect for anyone else  We ate at Kitty OSheas Irish pub in the hotel one night  Menu was dissappointing as was the meal but the atmosphere and staff was great  Plenty of restaurants nearby so venture out and check them out  There is plenty of shopping located nearby also  We purchased the hop on hop off trolley ticket which was  each  So this is a great way to see all the sights at your pace  A great little place to eat was about  blocks away  Takes about  minutes to walk there but what a great feed  It was called Grace OMalleys Irish Pub just past S Michigan Avenue and th Street  I had Salmon for  and my husband had the pork for   These meals were excellent  We would highly recommend staying at the Hilton and eating at Grace OMalleys  Parking at the Hilton is very dear   per night self parking or  valet  Everything is within a easy walk away  We booked our stay online and saved heaps on our room only paying  per night ex tax total cost  for both nights including taxes  Great value for a high classy hotel  Would definately stay here again  we loved Chicago what a beautiful city  
P => Hilton surpise hit I visit Chicago often and ided to stay at the Hilton last week for a change of pace  It is located on So Michigan Ave away from the Magnificent Mile and closer to the Art Institute and Field Museum  What a great place this turned out to be The front desk agents were so helpful polite and accommodating  I immediately got upgraded upon arrival  My bed was completely comfortable and the bathroom was perfect   probably bigger than all the bathrooms in my home combined I had room service for dinner which arrived within  minutes  Same with breakfast  Coffee was delivered as promised promptly at am with a newspaper  I will look forward to staying here in the future  
P => Happy at the Hilton The Chicago Hilton is a little more Barbara Bush and not so much Paris Hilton    reliable comfortable practical and classy  If youre looking for sexy and flashy this isnt the place  Your experience at this Hilton will be largely determined by which of the many unique rooms you end up booked in  Its a historic hotel with a wealth of famous customers and there is a wide variety of room layouts unlike the cookie cutter hotels of today Some of the rooms are indeed smaller than one would expect    but a lot of them are bigger than expected too with some unusual perks such as two full bathrooms for a room with two double beds  Hilton Honors members seem to get the best picks of the litter with views overlooking the lake and Soldier Field  The service is reliable and efficient  Ive ordered room service there a few times and it was consistent  The food is not anything exciting again not Emerils    a little more TGI Fridays  Location is OK    not close to the shopping area of downtown Chicago but there is a free shuttle service that runs guests to and from that area  
P => Did not like it I would never again stay at the Hilton Chicago  First of all it is not in the best section  You have to walk guiet a way to get to any restaurants or shopping  The room we stayed in was very small and not in the best condition  The rugs were worn and the furniture kind of shabby  Also there was a very strong smell of cheap cologne in the room  The smell made me very sick  I think that the hotel could be better if it were remolded and updated  I do have to say though that the staff was very pleasant and helpful  
P => Great I had a GREAT experience  I went to Chicago for pleasure  The location of the hotel was in a great spot if you want to do the tourist thing  Very close to Shedd Aquarium Field Museum and Soldiers Field  It was just a short taxi ride away from great restaurants  It is a bit far from the United Center Lincoln Park and the Navy Pier though  The service was exceptional  The room was large  I dont see how anyone could complain about this place  
P => Great hotel great stay I stayed at the Hilton Towers  So Michigan Ave Chicago IL in the middle of ember   It was a one night stay the trip was part business trade show and part fun  The room had great beds two bathrooms was clean and well taken care of  Check inout was effortless  Self parking seemed a bit high   tax per night however the room rate from the Hilton web site was great for mid  week in downtown Chicago  per night  tax  The rate is NONrefundable We spent the better part of the night at the hotels bar Kitty OSheas the food drink and Irish entertainment were all great We had breakfast in the lobby the buffet was over priced under stocked and not worth it Over all the stay was above average  
P => Wonderful Stay Stayed for  nights over NYE  Front desk concierge and cleaning staff were exceptionally friendly and very helpful got extra pillows booked dinner reservations for us  At times I felt like I was staying at a smaller hotel bc of the great service  Hotel is beautiful  Location is great if you are ok with not being in the center of things  We had a Standard King room which was a bit on the small side but still very nice  The bathroom was large  Bed was comfy  The view was amazing we had a corner room that overlooked the lake and everything is lit up at night  Ordered room service one night very quick and delicious but   The hotel staff even delivered it to the lobby for usbc the rest  were closed  There are a lot of common areas to sit and relax drink and eat fireplaces and great views of the street in the lobby of the hotel  There is one bar open pretty late and you can bring drinks up to your room if you like All in all we would stay here on our next visit  
P => ent hotel   but look elsewhere first This review is based on a  night stay in ember  and is written by a traveler that frequents riott chain and Hilton chain hotels throughout the US Tagline ent hotel but look elsewhere first if Magnificent Mile is important to you Features  benefits   Hotel was apparently reated in     two bed rooms feature two twin not double or queen beds and two bathrooms    one bathroom is small and houses a small vanity sink toilet and bath tub    the other bathroom is smaller and houses an even smaller vanity sink toilet and small shower    huge quot Phillips flat screen TV    fast elevators    Crabtree amp Evelyn toiletries provided    digital thermostat in each room Cons   only one small closet with  hangers for a two bed room    small bathrooms    room is surprisingly bright for the two lights it has but still leaves a little to be desired    be prepared to walk some distance if you want any food or shopping    Kitty OSheas Irish pubrestaurant in the hotel leaves something better food to be desired SumyImagine a hotel built to with the character and styling of the s being upgraded in some way linens  sheets wise and TV  to the styling of present day  That is the Hilton Chicago  Older classic styling with new white sheets and big screen TV Depending on your room rate this is either pricey given its distance from restaurants and Mag Mile or puts you in a closer position to out of downtown core locations like the Field Museam Shedd Aquarium Soldier Field and Alder Planetarium  
P => Fantastic View Fantastic room With a couple of exceptions the hotel and accomodations were fantastic  We were there for my husbands birthday and were truly impressed with the king jr  suite  The rooms were well appointed and the view from the st floor was outstanding  We could see the field museum planetarium and the aquarium The only drawback is we requested a non smoking room  When we walked into the room the smell of smoke was overwhelming  Called service and they ionized the room  That did not work and they had no other accomodations  The windows were operable and i just kept them open for the duration  The heat was  degrees anyway For our problems we were given two complimentary breakfasts on the day of departure The hotel is beautiful I would stay again but I would make sure that they understand that non smoking means just that  
P => Beautiful Lobby coldindifferent service poor dining choices The Hilton Chicago sometimes referred to as the Hilton Towers is a huge hotel geared priily for large scale conventions business meetings conferences etc  Weve stayed here several times using Hilton Points  Its a beautiful building and the lobby level is impressive  The location is good if you want to be close to Soldier Field great locale for a Bears game not a great location if youre wanting to shop the Mag MileN  Michigan Ave    although the hotel does offer a shuttle The rooms are small  This time ours had two baths which was nice  The beds are quite comfortable but know that if you need two doubles they are just that    doubles and rather small doubles  Definitely not queen beds  My husbands quot we had a child with us in the other bed and he was miserable  Next time wed get the king and a lay away The foodrestaurant choices are quite limited and two of the three we would not recommend  The Irish pub Kitty OSheas is listed on the kiosks and room advertisements as a restaurant but its a bar  A very smokey bar in every nook and cranny  Weve tried to use it several times but its really disgusting in terms of the cigarette smoke  And we are talking about   in the evening    not midnight The atrium area has a restaurant called the Pavillion  Food is just okay service is consistently indifferent unfriendly  High volume Ill never see you again why should I care attitudes abound  Wine selection is poor  Breakfast buffet is mediocre at best  There is an area directly across the lobby from the Pavillion that serves as a coffee barbistro in the morning and thats a nice area gas fireplace some of the only windows in the whole first floor which is nice because you can watch the passersby on the street for sitting and enjoying your morning coffee and juice or a pastry  We havent tried the steak house  Looks quite nice but wasnt exceptionally busy on a Saturday evening so I doubt its a destination restaurant other than among the business travelershotel guests  There are so many great restaurants in Chicago I suppose this category doesnt really matter Even when traveling for business I prefer a smaller more personable hotel myself But if youre using Hilton Points or find a room rate to youre liking then the Hilton Chicago is a beautiful immaculate building and most definitely worth a visit  I prefer it to the Drake which has slightly better service only slightly because competence without warmth is still mediocre hospitality since The Drake is in desperate need of a facelift  
P => A very enjoyable stay at Hilton Chicago We loved the Hilton  We were expecting a large business hotel with a cold impersonal feel to it but we were wrong  The hotel is certainly large but it is very comfortable with excellent friendly staff  The cost of our stay was not cheap but we stayed there as my husband was running in the Chicago athon and this was the official hotel for the event  Consequently it was completely full with a really great atmosphere  Despite the huge numbers that had to be catered for all of the staff without exception were unfailingly polite friendly and courteous  The concierge desk was probably the best I have encountered they were so helpful and special mention must go to Oscar who arranged for a new UK travel adaptor to be sent to our room about  minutes after it was requested  The hotel public areas are extremely nice   the bar and restaurant were both very good with excellent service and we enjoyed the breakfast  Room service was also efficient  The room was okay it was quiet and we had two bathrooms   my only criticism is that one of them was a bit tired looking  We also had a problem with the time it took to make the room up on a weekend day but the housekeeping staff were under pressure  For a leisure trip the hotel is excellently located overlooking Grant Park and close to the lakeside the Art Institute and Museum  The tour bus stops outside  Overall I found the Hilton Chicago was a lovely comfortable hotel with excellent staff who were very efficient and friendly but not intrusive  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Busy Expensive and Less than Stellar Service This hotel is focused on conventions and massive events  Ive gone to a lot of chicago based organization conventions here  mostly healthcare   Convention rooms can be far far away from each other and in a mazelike system Rooms can be very small and loud if on the industry side  The cattlecar nature of check in and check out has been ameliorated somewhat by the kiosks available    if they work  When i was there in ust most didnt and i couldnt print my boarding pass  The latter created significant problems because i was shown to have already checked in    forcing me to go to an agent to get checked in If you have a choice stay on the north michigan side of things  The service and the amenties and proximity to fun eventswalkingrestaurants are much more pleasant  
P => Good King Tut package The hotel is beautiful and very large  It is a very impersonal place  We had a corner ior suite that overlooked the southern part of Grant Park and Museum Campus  I liked that  We were on the King Tut package booked through the hotel and it was a VERY good move  Our tickets were express tickets that did not specify a time to visit the Field Museum  We could enter the exhibit anytime with the exception of  blackout weekend times that did not affect us  Plus the tickets allow you to enter from the South entrance rather than the East entrance which is the priy entrance for the Tut exhibit  The lines at the East entrance were ridiculous so we felt very lucky  The weird thing was that the hotel gave us  tickets to the exhibit when we arrived and there are only  of us  We could have gone through the exhibit  times each if we had wanted  I am not sure if this is standard practice or a fluke  The hotel is in a great location if you are visiting the Museum Campus Millenium Park Grant Park etc  It is walking distance to shopping if you really like to walk  We didnt find a lot of local restaurants nearby and we tended to eat while we were out and about  The El was only a short walk away though and taxis were always lined up at the entrance to take you anywhere you wanted to go  Overall I wasnt blown away by the hotel but I cant find anything specific and horrible to complain about  It is an old grand hotel with lots of activity and loads of people milling about at all times  Personally I like a hotel where the staff knows whether or not you belong in the building or not so I would prefer a smaller boutique hotel on my next trip  We got a lot of exercise just walking to and from our room  
P => Great hotel What a great hotel  Rooms are beautifully presented although our room only had one bathroom as it was on the corner  Our friends next door had two bathrooms  The staff are very friendly especially the housekeepers who greet you every time you meet on the corridor  The pool is fine but there is a charge to use the gym  The rooms are in great condition but the hallways perhaps need to be updated  I would not pay over  dollars for this hotel however  
P => Excellent Convention Hotel I had read some of the reviews and was a little worried  But upon arrival I was impressed  The hotel is located near the Grant Park and within walking distance to the quotMagnificent Milequot  Is is a very large hotel and accomodates conventions nicely with the extra meeting rooms on the main lower levels and on floors  and  My wife needed to have a refrigerator to store her medication and they were happy to send one right up quotfree of chargequot  We also discovered that the drains were draining slow and they quickly fixed the problem It was nice to have  bathrooms in the room It made getting ready in the morning that much faster  There was also a live blues club right next door that I would highly recommend  I found the rooms to be very spacious and the beds most comfortable  I also found the noise in hall ways to almost be non existent  The only down side was the lack of having a wired internet connection  I had to get a bridge connection and the cost was  a day for the connection Overall I would highly recommend this hotel not only for its location but also for the excellent service  
P => Hilton Towers   fantastic My family and I have just had a two week holiday in Chicago and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers  We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel  The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable  If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey type hotels be this wouldnt be your thing  However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz you will be bowled over by this hotel  The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby  Tons of celebs have stayed here over the ades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating  We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place 
P => Much better options in Chicago No service at all     Small room although I had booked a room on the executive floor Breakfast is worse than in a cafeteria  And dont be one minute late because there wont be anything left to grab If you need to store your luggage be prepared to pay for it  Beds are small and bathrooms quite tiny Might have been a good spot  years ago  
P => Hilton good  Just got back from a  night stay at The Hilton South Michigan Avenue  We were on the th floor in a  bed room with two bathrooms  The main bathroom was very nice but the additional shower room was very badly designed with the door opening into the shower so much that you had to press yourself up against the shower wall to get enough space to close it  The room was clean and the beds and bedding very nice and comfortable  The concierge who I think was called Donald was one of the most helpful people I have come across and he helped us book tickets to see the Cubs play at Wrigley Field and offered a whole host of advice re transport etc  The worst parts of the hotel I would say is the pool its so overpowering with chlorine that you can smell it as soon as you exit the lifts on the th floor if I had been staying on this floor I would have asked to have been moved due to this As for Buckinghams the waiting staff are very polite to begin with but if you leave a less than adequate tip which we did as they had forgotten a coule of things off our order we were asked in a very surly tone if things had been ok they were obviously not impressed with out   tip    rather than a      tip this ruined what had been an ok dining experience and I wouldnt eat in this restaurant again due to this  Kitty OSheas was very good we had a couple of snacks in here the service was good and the live music also very good  As for location its ideal for Grant Park The Shedd Aquarium Museums and PlanatariumSoldier Field etc but a little out of the way of the shopsriver having said this the free shuttle bus which leaves on the hour every hour was very very useful and we used this several times  Tips for the Tourist Sites Dont pay to go up the Hancock Centre instead go to the bar a couple of floors down which is free entry and spend the money on a cocktail If you visit the Cheesecake Factory you will have a wait but it was worth it dont orders starters though as the portions are huge you will never finish it all    save room for the cheescake  The Spirit of Chicago Dinner Cruise was very average the food was poor and the entertainment very holiday camp standard however the firework display and the views of the skyline were very good  The architectural boat cruises were very good a nice way to spend   hours  If you intend to shop in Bloomingdales visit the Guest Information Desk first they will give you a   voucher for any purchases you make on the day over  and they also have some very useful maps and booklets of where to shop where to dine etc I found these booklets really good and better than the ones available in the hotels  Do try to get to see a baseball game the EL or subway train will take you right to the ground  We also found a lovely little place for breakfast behind the Hilton at  West Harrison Street its called Orange and the fresh fruit and pancakes and freshly squeezed juices are really worth the  minute walk from the Hilton for breakfast the staff are friendly and the place is nice and relaxed several pieces of local artwork on the walls    all of it for sale also make it interesting definitely worth a visit  The beach is good for a hot day take something to sit on as we didnt manage to find any sun loungers or chairs to hire  One thing I would recommend you to do is The House of Blues Gospel Brunch this was really fun the food good and the Gospel Singers were fantastic book ahead for this one to make sure you get in  Afternoon tea at The Drake was superb highly recommended 
P => Not a Hilton youd expect My teen dhter and teen nephew stayed at the Hilton on the first weekend of ust   We Had a nd fl suite with  bathrooms  The check in was great and courteous and we enjoyed the interior beauty of this Chicago landk  The linens were soft and the pillows dreamy with super comfortable beds  The location to the Field Museum and Millineum Park is minutes away  Only a couple of small concerns that I can say and it is when a bathroom is cleaned by the staff they could take the time to wipe off the grime from the light switch covers and remove the black mold from the shower curtain a little gross  Also when we checked in around  p m  and we were on our floor to get to our room we had to somewhat dodge the food trays left along the floor from the other suites  We went out for the evening and arrived after  p m  and the trays were not taken away  The next morning I wanted to express my concerns at the front desk and there was no way we would get thru the line ups before  minutes  For the location I would recommend to stay but the cleanliness is a concern  
P => Too Many Extra Fees I stayed at the Chicago Hilton for a conference at McCormick Place  The room was very nice    double beds and  bathrooms  Beds were confortable and the baths were lovely What irritated me was the way they charged for little things  The fitness center which is very nice for a hotel was  per day It certainly wasnt that nice   I think the indoor track was probably  of a mile   not great for a runner  I actually managed to get exchange privledges for the FitPlex gym on State street which was absolutely fabulous The pool and the tiny track are free but the pool was closed the first dy we were there  Now that wasnt the hotels fault as a child had contaminated it but they should have allowed guests to use the fitness center at a discounted rate since the pool was unavailable to swim laps  Frankly the girl working the desk was rude when I made that comment even though I was polite to her  Additionally like many travelers although I checked out in the morning my flight wasnt until the evening  I have never before had a problem storing luggage at the hotel  At the Hilton Chicago you had to go to the nd floor not the bellman and pay to have your bags stored  Granted it wasnt expensive but it seems ridiculous given what you pay per night that they feel the need to charge   per bag At the end of the day I probably wouldnt go back  Especially when I travel for business it is very important to me to keep up with my daily fitness routine and I refuse to pay day for mediocre facilities  For what you pay these things should be included Chicago is a lovely city and I will return but will stay elsewhere  
P => A good choice if you have Hilton Honors status  The first thing you need to know about this hotel is that it is huge  At one time it was the largest hotel in the world  You get all the problems that any large hotel has  It takes forever to get room service and there is an especially large dollar delivery charge this is understandable since the kitchen is probably in a different zip code  Service in general is not very good but I thinks this is inherent in any large hotel  With that said I did like the hotel  It is in a nice location Michigan Avenue facing Grant Park  If you are in Chicago for pleasure or a conference at McCormick place the location is hard to beat  Business people  prefer a hotel closer to the loop  Because of its size you can usually get a room at the Hilton if other hotels are full  It is usually one of the last  or  star hotels to fill up  Hotwire has good deals on this hotel look for the  star property in or near The Loop   that is usually the Hilton  other  star properties in the Loop are usually full or dont post on Hotwire  If you have Hilton Honors status Diamond the hotel is especially nice  You should get an upgraded room on one of the top floors th or th  These have erate elevators no small perk because remember the hotel is huge and a lounge  Ask for a lake view  
P => Nice hotel but not a great value I just finished a  night s stay here for a work conference  My room  conference rate  per night was  or  including all taxes  My first disappointment was I had to pay one nights worth at time of the reservation months ahead  Then the poolathletic club remains open only until pm so I never got to use it that s not late enough in my opinion  My other disappointment was the EL train could be heard at all hours of the daynight from my room on the th floor I did not have a parklake view so I m sure that contributed to the noise My room had two double beds and two baths  Since it was just me two of each was not important to me but be for others  The mattress was ok but the linens were excellent  One of the baths was extremely large for a hotel bath the other was the standard size  Everything was clean and in good working order but in a   star hotel I expect this  It is a very beautiful hotel from an era when building a hotel meant something those who appreciate architecture will enjoy this hotel  Wireless internet is day but if you don t mind walking the public library is just down two blocks on Congress and offers  hr of internet access for free per day bring an ID All in all I was not impressed with the hotel and don t think it was a good value at night  I expected more amenities and quiet at that rate  
P => The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel My family and I  adults and  children stayed at the Chicago Hilton from y  y  and agree with other reviewers that I cant understand the negative reviews that others have written about this hotel  The Chicago Hilton is a grand old hotel but very up to date and is beautiful inside  The front lobby is gorgeous and very elegant  Our room was very spacious with  very comfortable queen beds and a nice ble bathroom  The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of space for  people  We didnt have a spectacular view but Im sure if we asked to be moved they would have accommodated us if possible  The staff was wonderful  One of our sons was taking medication that needed to be refrigerated and when we realized that we didnt have a refrigerator I called the front desk to inquire about one  I was told that they do supply refrigerators for a fee of  a day  Thinking that was a little steep I asked if there was another option  The clerk that I spoke to immediately transferred me to one of the managers and when I explained the situation he agreed to send up a refrigerator to our room and waive the fee  He did this without me even asking To me that was great customer service The concierge Donald was very knowledgeable and helpful with all of our questions and suggestions  The restaurant in the hotel that we ate in was a little pricey but the food was good and it was convenient  The hotel is directly across the street from Grant Park which has nice walkingbikingskating trails to travel on  Very nice landscaping and a nice place to spend some time  Make sure you get over to the park to see the fountain at night when there is a light show and music  There is a free trolley that takes you to various places in the city but we were able to see a lot of the sites on foot from the hotels location  We took a water taxi to the Navy Pier that was a little too far to walk    especially with  kids and that was a fun way to see the city and also to rest our tired feet All in all we had a great experience staying at the Chicago Hilton and will definitely stay there again whenever we go back to Chicago  
P => Great th of y Weekend We stayed at the Hilton from e    y    Our room was first rate and the service at the hotel was too  The hotel has a great location on Michigan Ave across the street from Grant Park  The first weekend in y is the Taste of Chicago festival and the fireworks which takes place in Grant Park  So this is a great location for both  We also found it easy to visit all of the sites in downtown by either walking or taking a taxi We would definitely stay again  
P => Memorable Experience My husband and I stayed here for one night after we were ried and we were impressed with the hotel staff  We told the lady at the check in desk that we had just gotten ried and when we came back from dinner we noticed that a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries had been sent to our room  We considered this a wonderful act of service and it showed that the hotel really valued and listened to its customers  Our room was lovely and clean and this made for a comfortable stay  We were only there one night before flying out for our honeymoon but we wished we could have stayed a little longer to enjoy some of the other hotel amenities and the downtown Chicago activities  
P => Great Stay at the Hilton Had a great stay at the Hilton  Upgraded to a room on the Executive Level with  full size beds and  baths  The room was very clean and the entire staff was friendly  Unable to get a lake view without paying an extra night  Also continental breakfast is free for Executive level guest  Great location very close to the Taste of Chicago event  Free shuttle to Magnificent Mile  Fire broke out at the hotel during my visit but still had a ball  
P => Beware of the  bed and  bath room While my title says quotbewarequot I merely say this as a precaution when you select which room you want  Everything else was very top notch  We got our room on a good deal with Hotwire  When we arrived the check in line was long so my wife and I didnt want to wait and instead we headed for the auto check in kiosks  While going thru the screen the room with a king bed was not available but the system opted for a room with quot beds  bathrooms quot We immediately selected the room with excitement thikning we were getting a suite  So the machine spit out the room keys and my receipt and we were on our way  When we arrived at the room the description was right  beds and  bathrooms  However the two beds were TWIN BEDS  Suddenly we were back in the s like Lucy and Ricky Ricardo  Since we were only staying one night and we were too tired to go back down and change our room we ided to sleep one night in arate beds  Besides the bed logistics the room itself was great  The bathrooms were both clean and had La SourceCrabtree amp Evelyn ameneties  The beds themselves were very comfy  All in all its a perfect room for friends travelling since  bathrooms means getting ready can happen in less time  The hotel clientele varies from Chicago tourists to business travellers  Its almost like going to Vegas where you have people dressed to the nines intermingling with folks in sweatshirts and jean shorts waiting in line for breakfast  The attached stores and restaurants are nice too  The latest bar to stay open is Kitty OSheas unless another bar has enough people  As far as location its great for getting into Grant Park so those going to Taste of Chicago or Lollapalooza wouldnt need any taxi or bus help whatsoever  Also parking is pricey    a day  Consider other all day options from lots around the area if you dont mind walking a few blocks  So all in all its a fine hotel  Just watch what you shop for  
P => Actually pretty nice Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for a long weekend  I simply do not understand the negative reviews of the hotel on this site    perhaps they come from people who only want to stay in sterile ultra modern hotels The lobby of the hotel is spectacular  The rooms were actually very large and nice with new furnishings done in a style to match the hotels public spaces  The beds and linens were very comfortable and our room had new electronics and web tv  There is absolutely no reason for this hotel to be considered anything less than a four star by anyone who has done a bit of traveling  Is this a Penninsula or Four Seasons No but it doesns cost   per night  At a minimum this hotel has all the comfort and amenities you would find at any  star business hotel wrapped up in a grand old package  I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => This place is great  I stayed here for one night    and overall I thought that this place was great  I arrived at am to ask when I would be able to check in  They lady at the Hilton HHonors front desk counter told me to give her my cell phone number and that she would call me when my room was ready  I told her that would be great  I was able to leave my luggage for free until I returned  I doubted that they would really call me but sure enough at PM the same lady called me and told me that my room was ready  I just had to pick up the key at the front desk I received a King Non smoking room as I requested on the th floor  The room was great  The AC was quiet and worked fine  The room was plenty big and I barely heard the El go by during the day  The bed was comfy  The bathroom however was a bit small  I have silver status with Hilton HHonors which usually isnt worth too much  But at this hotel I received free access to the huge Hilton Athletic Club on the th floor and two complimentary bottles of water in the room  I would stay at this hotel again simply because of the size the gym  Many past reviewers have commented on the prices at the hotel restaurants  Yes they are quite expensive but you are paying for location and convenience  I had the cold breakfast buffet on Monday morning for   and I thought the food was fine  The service was greatComplaints There was a NCFL debate tournament at this hotel during my stay and the elevators were always slow  I doubt this would be a problem if I stayed at the hotel when they were less busy  The toilet in the room backed up several times and seemed to take several flushes to do the trick  I payed   tax for the room and thought that it was good value for Chicago  
P => Loved the hotel We loved the hotel  When I see other posts about it being shabby I cant for the life of me figure out what they are talking about  Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms lobby was fabulous pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym staff was courteous  For us the location was great  across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres  Im sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location  Got it for  on Hotwire  What a bargain for such a nice hotel  
P => Feel in love with the Hilton Chicago Our Hilton Chicago stay was amazing  I fell in love with the views the room the staff  We stayed on the Executive floor where delicious treats are provided throughout the day the beds are memorable and the rooms have three phones and a huge television  We found the floor to be very quiet  Darwin drove the shuttle free for the regular man during my stay  He made me you feel like a queen each time you boarded  I was told he was usually the bell captain so look for him  After reading some reviews we almost didnt stay here  It was historic however and so we took the chance  You will feel transported back to the golden years and if you quiet yourself youll pick up on the grandness  
P => Look elsewhere We stayed at  Hilton properties on our trip    this one and the Palmer House using HHonors points where available each night of our stay  At each hotel we were given a room on the executive level  The Palmer House was easily the nicest of the  hotels The Chicago Hilton looks like a has been  The entry area is beautiful but most of the lobby looks like it hasnt been updated for a long time  Except for the comfortable pillowtop beds you could say the same about the rooms  Our room was very cramped and had a tired old air conditioning system that never quite cooled as desired  The  bathrooms really showed their age with worn polished brass fixtures  The entire hotel appears to be very clean but outdated  The location is great for going to Grant Park but not close to anything else  Most restaurants require a  to  minute walk  Hilton seriously needs to update this property  Their in room pamphlet describes the hotels history and touts the  million update done in the early s  It is evident that they are still trying to squeeze out a return on that investment  Go to the Palmer House instead  
P => Pleasantly Surprised We have just come back from a four night stay at the Chicago Hilton on South Michigan Avenue and I am pleased to say the hotel surpassed our expectations especially after reading a few of the more critical reviews on this website  The entrance is impressive and quite grand and there were huge bouquets of fresh flowers dotted about the lobby which was a nice touch  The staff on check in were also very friendly and welcoming  We were offered a king size bed and although we had no view to speak of the room was large and very clean The hotel is about a   minute walk to Sears Tower and about   minutes to the Shedd Aquarium and Lake Michigan through Grant Park  My only criticism of the hotel is that the location is South Michigan Avenue rather than the main shopping hub where some of the other big hotels are located on North Michigan  If you dont mind a brisk  minute walk or hopping in a taxi about   dollars to the other end of Michigan Avenue then I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Expected more from the hotel       It was just okay  The hotel needs to be remodeled  For what I paid I could have easily stayed at a nicer hotel in the same area  
P => fading like memories Im really lukewarm on this hotel  Ive stayed here several times and have some wonderful memories of family events here  Its definitely one of the grand old hotels and relatively well kept up  However it seems like there are so many better choices in Chicago  On my last two stays weve been upgraded Hilton Hhonors diamond level to the executive floors and had great views of the lake  The executive floor lounge has drinks and snacks in the afternoon and continental breakfast in the morning  Both are average and comparable to the same at any other hotel  The lounge room itself isnt anything special  The rooms on both of the past two stays were very small although Ive had bigger rooms in the hotel without lake view  The bedding and orating in the bedrooms are typical Hilton and fairly new  The TV is comically large for such a small room  The bathrooms were updated at some point with ble floors and countertops but it looks like it was probably in the s because of the gold trim faucets and fixtures which look very out of date now  On top of that the finish isnt holding up very well  My biggest complaint with my most recent stay is that there is NOTHING available in the hotel for eating after  PM  except room service and even that is very limited  I returned from the theatre at  expecting to be able to at least get a sandwich in the bar but no  I wanted to ask the concierge to recommend something in the neighborhood but nobody was working at that desk  The front desk had one employee and about  people in line  I finally asked a person at the bell stand and he said there was a bar two blocks back but that looked too seedy to me  So the only choice was room service and that was extremely limited and of course had all the extra costs associated with it  Im really surprised that such a large hotel with the level of service that this one promises couldnt do better  For this reason alone I think Ill stop using this hotel while I still have SOME nice memories of times there One final note parking here like any of the downtown Chicago hotels is expensive  There is a private parking garage directly behind the hotel on Wabash St  that has  hr parking w in amp out for   Its almost as close as parking in the hotel and about half the price  
P => Wont stay here again   give me a riott any day I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending  Before I arrived I tried to find out about the quotIn Room Fitnessquot program advertised on the corporate website  I called the  reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center  I explained that I was inquiring about the In Room Fitness advertised on their website  She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly  I did and got the same response  I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room  Again this was a problem  When I arrived at the hotel no treadmill was available  When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at pm  When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge  per day to use the fitness equipment  The pool track and locker room are free but to use the treadmills etc  you have to pay  per day  This charge is not noted anywhere    not on the website not in any of the guest service materials in the room  The food for the conference was mediocre but the one room service meal I had was pretty good  During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldnt hear the speaker  The HVAC didnt work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay  The beds were comfortable with very nice linens  I tried to get a late checkout which was offered on a card in my room  The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour not the  pm range advertised in my room  The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office  The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldnt carry it out of the hotel  I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the riott properties  Only wish I had done so for this visit  
P => Awful stay at the Michigan Avenue Hilton Chicago This hotel was a disappointment in so many ways  Heat could not be regulated in rooms dogs allowed with little to no management over their barking radios didnt work st room was dirty and very noisy by Maids room  Upon checking out noted a  bill on my room  Hotel clerk noted that I had used the mini bar for that cost  Since I didnt use the mini bar nor had I checked into that room after the first dirty one until  PM and the bar had been used by previous smoking residents  The Hotel clerks attitude was dismissive and she told me that I could call the next day to clear it up with a Manager who she called  She finally cleared the bill for the mini bar  Never again will I knowingly stay at a HiltonRestaurant was very good however 
P => Good hotel but watch out for the charges   This was our rd stay ampand it was a little disppointing from past experiences  Let me start with the great things  Number one is the service everyone we met provided outstanding service from the bell staff to the Pavillion waiter  I was espically impressed with the Towers Floor Concierge Oscar  Not that my questions and requests of him was all that burdensome but getting to observe him with other guests while relaxing in the lounge made me wish every hotel had an Oscar  But overall the entire staff exhibited a Four Seasons level of service The first disappointing thing was the room itself  It was a very small room  with no view of anything other than other rooms directly across from it  Also while it did have a desk it was too small to have a table or any other way for  people to have an in room dinner  On the plus if not unusual side it did have two bathrooms  At first I brushed off this knowing that the hotel can only have so many lake view or city view rooms  Then I met other guest who were loving their fantastic lakeview room the booked through Priceline for about half the price I was paying for mine and were Hilton Gold members to boot  They said they got it since the hotel was at such low occupancy The low occupancy was my other disappointment although I cant blame the hotel for that  Because of the slow period one of my to do things dinner at their steakhouse Buckinghams was skipped because Buckinghams was closed during our stay  The Pavillion was certainly good sandwich fare but no steakhouse  Also because of the low occupancy their free shuttle to the downtown shopping area wasnt running either  The last disappointment and I dont want to make too big a deal about these is the nickle and dimeing the hotel has taken to  First the  parking fee another reviewer referenced is now   for valet late check out even with low occupancy is  and if you want the bellstaff to hold your bags for you that is another   per bag  This has to the first time Ive ever seen that charge at any hotel I hope it doesnt catch on To finish on a good note because there is more good than disapponts the room and entire hotel was extremely clean and well furnished  We had a large flat screen TV very plush bedding with a least a half dozen pillows and housekeeping kept the room well stock with their evening turndown service I will come back I just wish they had choices on the web site where you could reserve a lakeview room even if they charged a premium for them rather than having them be the luck of the draw  
P => Loved the Chicago Hilton and Towers We stayed at the Chicago Hilton just before Christmas last year and were absolutely enthralled with the hotel  The orations were gorgeous and the staff extremely friendly    all of which made the visit quite magical  As advertised the Chicago Hilton is more like a city within a hotel as it has within its walls several restaurants an Irish Pub shops ballrooms etc  The entrance lobby had a gorgeous Christmas tree and there was usually some type of entertainment i e  piano player childrens choir etc  Our room was very comfortable quite clean and extremely quiet  We had a corner room at the back of the hotel with a ent view of the neighborhood and the Sears Tower  Plus I booked the room on line through United vacations and got a great rate One tip if youre not planning on renting a car take the Blue Line quotLquot from Chicago OHare  We landed at OHare just ahead of one of the biggest snow storms of the season boarded the train and ended up zipping past all the poor people who were stuck on the highway  Catch the train right in the airport transfer to the Red Line at either Washington or Jackson stations and then take the Red Line south to Harrison  Exit the station and walk about two blocks east to Michigan Avenue  Turn right and the Hilton is just a block or two away  
P => So much better than  years ago   now its great Thirty years ago we had a tiny quotroomquot and indifferent service  This time the service was superb and friendly throughout with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop the door and bell persons and the hilton honors person at the front desk  They even lowered our price to moderately high when we inquired a few days before our stay  When we want to stay south of the river downtown we will be back 
P => Will not stay any longer We have stayed at the Hilton and Towers for the last four years in ember  My wife and I do a downtown getaway for ourselves  Each year it gets more difficult staying here  We checked in Friday evening   th  The lady at the front desk was Oriental and I had a difficult time understanding her  They did not have a king like I had requested months ago  She found a king eventually and it turned out to be a handicap room  With my wife being a nurse that is the last type of room she wanted to see  I trudged back down to see the mgr  He gave us a different king room  This one with two bathrooms  In one of them the bathtub did not drain  The TV controller did not work  Our view was of three walls outside our window  Each year there seems to be more problems and   to park your car overnight is ridiculous  The shuttle is close by and thats good and the bed was very nice  
P => Great Deal My husband and I went to Chicago for the first time this ember to see a Bears game  This hotel was fantastic  We got a great internet rate right on their website  We checked in earlier than expected and the hotel had a room ready and waiting for us  Although it is a little south of quotthe loopquot the hotel offered a free shopping shuttle that brought you as far up Michigan Ave  as you wanted to go  It took a little while but the walk back was really nice  This is a great location for anyone seeing a game at Soldier Field  It is within walking distance approx   mile as are several of the major museums  We could actually see the field from our room  We had some trouble with our sink and tub draining but we called the front desk and not only did they fix it but they also called us to make sure that it was done to our satisfaction  I felt very safe the whole time we were there and the best part was that the subway was only  blocks away and took us directly to and from the airport  No need for a car if you are staying here  We would stay here again in a second  
P => Better than expected  I got a good rate on the Hilton through Priceline  Initially I was disappointed due to the south of the loop location of this hotel and some of the reviews  It ended up being an above average hotel  Had a room with king bed and view of the Sears tower  Amenities were good room was spacious maid service was good really comfy bed nice TV and great lobby  Tons of people running through the lobby even on thanksgiving day but didnt get to try any of the restaurants  The best part of this property that made up for its not so great location was that it was  blocks from the red line train  We were able to get everywhere we wanted Second City Loop Magnificent Mile Sears Tower Hancock Tower by just hopping on the train  Great hotel in a better than expected location 
P => birthday weekend my family and i stayed at the chicago hilton for  nights  The staff were nice valet service staff were very acommendating and they went far beyond our expectations to make my family feel very welcome  The breakfast buffet was fit for royalty and we plan to return very soon The rooms with  bathrooms were very spacious and convenient for all of the family  we were very honored to receive a personalized quothand writtenquot thank you note from lisa chmiel only days after our checkout date  the beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms very beautiful and spacious  the room was very clean but next time we would prefer a view of grant park and lake michigan  thank you for allowing me to experience a wonderful birthday  
P => Beautiful and luxurious My husband and I were in Chicago for a Bon Jovi concert for one night and we purchased our standard king room on Hotwire for    What a great deal considering the Palmer House Hilton was charging   for the same Saturday night We usually stay at the Palmer House when in Chicago and like the convenient location near to the train station and shopping  The only downside to the Hilton Towers is that the location is poor for shopping and the neighborhood is not desirable  Also we had a hard time hailing a cab after the concert at the United Center  However EVERYTHING else about the Hilton on Michigan Ave  was perfect  We had a luxurious clean king size bed with  down pillows and down comforter and pillow top mattress  The room had a corner view of the museum and the lake but it was raining and we couldnt see too much anyway  We could not find one speck of dirt anywhere not even on the windowsills The furniture was beautiful and elegant and the ble tub enclosure with brass fixtures was a nice touch  Also a large flat screen TV was appreciated  We also enjoyed the fully stocked minibar  We ate dinner at Kitty OSheas Irish Pub  The red haired waitress was pleasant and smiled a lot but it was smoky and very loud  This is not a criticism however because at  pm on a Saturday night in Chicago one would expect that in a pub  The food was good and portions were huge  Breakfast at the Pavillion restaurant was fantastic  I had the fruit and cereal bar which reminded me of the fare served at European hotels including coldcuts cheese and croissants  All the staff were friendly and helpful from the maid to the valet to the concierge who gave excellent directions to the waiters to the reception clerk  The really outstanding part my husband forgot his carry on bag in our room and when we called the hotel from home they sent it to us by FedEx in ONE DAY at their expense  We had football tickets to a Notre Dame game the following week so it was important that it arrived quickly  We are very impressed with this hotel and felt like royalty while we were there  We highly recommend it 
P => Fabulous hotel I am just back from Chicago and the Hilton  I was there with my three girlfriends and found the hotel great  We got upgraded because I am Hilton Gold so we were able to use the Executive floor for free breakfasts and between  pm free nibbles and an honor bar  We had booked a room with two bathrooms which was very big and had a partial view of the lake The hotel is straight across the the road from Grants park and further up the Millenhium Park which was stunning with the trees changing colour etc  The Executive floor staff were excellent booking restaurants etc for us and were very helpful  The swimming pool is huge and has windows all around which was another plus  To shop it is just around a slow half hours walk to North Michigan Avenue which we did quite a lot or you can take the free shuttle there leaves every hour and returns every hour  We checked in and out with no problem no waitin etc  We thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality of the Chicago people and staying at this hotel and would definately stay here again  Chicago is just beautiful  
P => Pricey This was our second stay both times we got a super deal from Priceline  and thats the only reason I would suggest staying there  Its not worth the rack rate  Valet parking costs night not including tip and it takes at least min to retrieve your car  But the staff was friendly and the location across from Grant Park is quite convenient  Check in was speedy at pm  The room for our first stay was dingy and the furniture showed a lot of wear and tear  That was in il   For our second stay we happened to get a much nicer newer looking room with a very comfortable bed and big TV  Smoking is allowed in all common areas like the elevator lobbies  We had no problems waiting for elevators they were quite fast  The lobby is pretty but jam packed with all kinds of people so it is very loud and crowded  The attached Irish bar is smoky and lousy skip it  PS  Dont eat at the Artists Cafe down the street  overpriced with terrible service Overall not a bad stay not a bad hotel but not  star  They sure do nickel and dime you to death 
P => What a Rip Off I am currently staying four nights at the Hilton for business  Extremely overpriced and understaffed  First you have to pay   for internet  However if you are outside of your room in a common area you have to pay an additional fee to access the internet They  gym costs an additional  a day for guests  Of course the gym was empty during my stay because no one would pay  My room had an armoire place in front of the window blocking access  Extremely overpriced for an average room  Everything costs extra  I am very disappointed  I would rather stay at riott any day  
P => Beautiful hotel I read the reviews about this hotel after I had already made reservations  I was expecting something worse than what I actually received  Everyone and I mean everyone   from the valet attendant to the housekeeper was kind and courteous  We received our luggage from the bell captain within  minutes of getting into our room  There are three banks of elevators going to certain floors and I found them to be very prompt  The front desk clerks were very nice and knowledgeable about venues in the city  Check in and out was extremely fast considering that we were there during the opening games of the World Series  The lobby is absolutely gorgeous  I recommend that you get a lake view room  The only negative thing that I found about the entire hotel was that our room door seemed to weigh about  pounds  Im not sure if it was a fire door or if it was that heavy due to soundproofing but it could certainly knock you off of your feet if you stood in the doorway while it was closing  Overall I think that you get what you pay for and tipping really does a lot quotTo Insure Prompt Servicequot  We do have to remember that the bell captains and valet attendants  Et  Al  are in the service industry and probably dont make that much money  If you were in a position to get more money for doing something faster for one person than to another who wasnt going to tip you   what would you do Overall this is a huge great hotel with first class service  
P => Great location Stayed for  nights in ober  Excellent location across from Grant park  All staff at reception and concierge were friendly knowledgeable and made us feel welcome  Room was spacious and clean  The hotel restaurant across from reception was also excellent  I did not like the Irish bar because it was dirty and was full of smoke and also didnt like a barmaid in the bar near reception who had a bad attitude especially when she seemed to refuse tip left for nice male waiter and threw change at my husbandBut apart from these  small problems which involved quotattachedquot parts to the hotel we would stay at this hotel again  
P => Inconsistent The Hilton was once the largest hotel in the country and it has its place in Chicago history  It presents a nice image to the general public but its local management is behind the times  Some rooms are excellent though old and other rooms are lacking in good housekeeping and showing their age  The health club and swimming pool are actually located on top of the parking ramp  The restaurants and bar and overpriced and better food and brew can be found within walking distance  Id rather stay at the Drake for the same prices  
P => Very positive experience I obtained a room using Priceline and was unsure what to expect  The room was spacious and contained two full beds  The furnishings were in good repair and the room was quiet and comfortable  I had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan  This was a great value  for the location  We enjoy taking the kids to the Chicago museums so I look forward to staying at this location again 
P => Great Hotel for Our First Visit My husband and I had a great stay at this hotel over Labor Day weekend it was unlike some of the recent reviewers  experiences  We had booked a king room with two bathrooms and selected an upgrade to a king towers room via e check in before our arrival since my husband is a Gold HHonors member  We were given a king room on the rd floor which was executive level when we checked in at the arate HHonors check in desk  I asked the front desk attendant what the differences between all of the rooms that were listed during e check in and I had kept the Tripadvisor reviews in mind and she showed us a map of the hotel layout and where our room would be  She also explained that the two double bed rooms with two bathrooms were the biggest rooms  The entrance from Michigan Ave  is amazing and the hotel definitely had a  grand air  about it even though there were tons of people in the lobby  The lobby was always busy and noisy with many people around but our floor was always quiet  The Grand Ballroom was breathtaking and the hotel made a point of letting its guests know that it had hosted many distinguished guests and made appearances on various tv shows and in movies  It was a nice touch to have a tv in the Executive Level rooms and suites  elevators I regretted not keeping the king room with two bathrooms even though there were only two of us since our room wasn t huge but it was more than enough space for my husband and me  The room was off of the front of the building which had the lake and park views so we had a side city view that faced south  We were high enough so that we couldn t hear any noise from the street  The room had a historic air but everything was updated  Everyone repeatedly stated that the beds were incredibly comfortable but I didn t believe it until I slept on one myself  I always have difficulty sleeping in hotel beds but I didn t have any trouble at all which was a pleasant surprise and my husband agreed that it was the most comfortable bed he had ever slept on other than our own I m also sensitive to light and noise in the morning so I wear a sleeping mask and earplugs even at home and our three night stay was the first time that I never had to use either The trade off in having the smaller room was that we had access to the executive lounge which served continental breakfast in the morning hors d oeuvres in the afternoon and drinks through the evening  Luckily we were able to take advantage of this a couple of times  We were also told that we would have access to the fitness room but we didn t have a chance to use it The location was fine for us  We did realize that we weren t in the  heart of the action  but we spent a lot of time in the  Grant Park  area for Millenium Park the Art Institute the Jazz Festival and Museum Campus so it didn t bother us  There were several subwayEl stations nearby and we used it a lot to get from one part of the city to another as we ve done in other major cities One complaint that we did have was that the hotel seemed to  nickel and dime  its customers  Like a previous reviewer we had to pay   per piece of luggage and although we were aware of this practice in general we had never encountered it during any of our trips  Also we printed boarding passes out in the business center on the last day of our trip and had to pay  for each  I could understand charging for use of the internet but charging to print boarding passes seemed excessive  
P => Hilton Towers very nice We stayed in the Hiton Towers t  for  nights  Room was nicely orated  Extremely comfortable bed  Room was very quiet  We had one small problem with our phone ringing with wake up calls we did not order  We reported it the st morning and it happened again the nd morning  Called the Management and they reduced our room rate for both nights to compensate us  The hotels or is very elegant and quotold worldquot  It is about  block walk to the quotred linequot train Ive been in  other Chicago hotels Hyatt Regency Westin Best Western Inn of Chicago and this one had the nicest rooms  quiet amp comfortable bedParking at the hotel is  a night  On the street behind the Hilton are several parking lots for  a night I would stay there again but Id unplug the phone at night  
P => Good bits and not so good bits We were originally booked to stay at the W Hotel but due to a last minute change had to go to the Hilton instead  Having read the reviews I was a bit concerned but to be honest it is not that bad Good bits We arrived on Labour day and check in was speedy  First impressions of the hotel are fantastic   on entry you walk into a very grand opening with steps on each side leading up to pianos and a terrace overlooking the park  You certainly get the feel of staying somewhere expensive and elaborate  All of the public areas are clean and for such a huge hotel it is a bit of a comfort to see security guards patrolling around  Our room on the th floor was at the back of the hotel but we still had a great view of the Sears Tower at night  Our room was more than big enough and the television was a huge widescreen I only mention this because a previous reviewer mentions the TV as being small  The bathroom was big enough for two of us to be in there at the same time  It was clean with plentiful hot water The hotel is across the street from Grant Park and the Buckingham Fountain  You can also walk a little further up to Millenium Park  It is also close to the shops on State Street and some great pubdiner places on South Wabash  There is also a free shuttle that will take you up to the shopping on North Michigan Not so good bits The hotel is so huge it can feel a little impersonal  Didnt really bother us but I can see how others would be irritated by this  On our second and third days the Hotel hosted a nurses convention and a printers convention  The lobby was just packed the whole time with people on mobile phones  If you are a tourist looking for personal service and peace and quiet this  not be the place for you Although in a nice location the hotel really is out of the way for most of the quottouristquot type things nice restuarants and shopping  We are young and fit so didnt have a problem walking up to the North in the day but I can see how the location of the hotel could be a hinderance for the less mobile  Having said that we didnt really venture too far out at night   only a few blocks to eat   as it is definately quieter once the sun sets The bad bits  to use the fitness facilities  A cheek given the cost of the hotel in the first place    per bag to store your luggage  Again we consider this to be unreasonable  You would think such things would be complimentary The room service and restuarant costs  It was something like  for two eggs for breakfast  Take my advice   walk a block to Starbucks or the nearby Corner House BakerySumy Hotel was clean comfortable and very palatial  We would stay there again if we had to but for location would probably choose something further up Michigan Avenue  
P => worn out  I try to get the stay in Hilton wherever I go as their service had never disappointed me until this one I ided to stay there knowing that it was slightly out of the loop area and just way far away from the night scenes making the journey more difficult to get back to the hotel But when I arrived there unlike its grand features of famous history it was a tourist deluxe hotel which means there were lots of foreign group travellers occupying the lobby areas and their check in process is one of the airport ticketing service feature with this printing machine which did not do the good job for us which means when we needed the personal attention we had to wait longer with short staff numbers in sight The way to the elevator hall was sided with tacky display of shop arcades  I find it really cheap to see these features on the lobby level On each floor the corridors were really grand and wide stretched endlessly but the features were from s and looking tired and again with tacky carpet colors The room we got was cornered to have the view over the lake and the park in between but that particular spot in the corridor had a very unpleasant piss smell with wet floor  I guessed someone pissed in the floor and the cleaning staff did not notice it while they clean the rooms  Or they have simply too many rooms and could not check the same spot everyday The room sizedeluxe was excellent but again looking tired with this sour smell from an old room I believe  And I demanded them to come and clean the windows as there were some greasy hand ks and faceslips Instead of changing the room immediately they said they would send a cleaning crew to recheck the rooms  When I got back after pm still the same and I was roaring one the phone demanding them to clean the windows and desanitize the air in the room and in the corridor And the receptionist instead of apologizing was saying that I should understand this was an old hotel  I understood old tired features unlike other HIlton hotels I have been to but I could not compromise with cleanliness Eventually the director stepped in and deducted my cost with double points but it was too late  It spoiled my mood already I am sure this is a good deal for the group travelers  And I have seen the lobby bombarded with East European tourists sitting on any surface of the lobbystaircase hall talking loudly and some convention visitors to the hotel banquet rooms equally loud and with poor manners I would like to let other Hilton guests know that this is not the best place you should choose to stay while in Chicago So spend some more to stay inside the loop  There are excellent hotels there  I stayed in Swissotel in my next trip  
P => Chicago Hilton Up to Par with Other  Stars I generally visit Chicago   times a year but this was my first visit to the Chicago Hilton and Towers  I found it up to par with other  star hotels Id visited in the city  The room was quiet and spacious enough  The bed and pillows were comfortable be slightly better than other hotels and overall it had a nice atmosphere  We upgraded to the two bathroom suite which was nice when it came time to get ready in the morning The location is ideal if you plan on spending time at the various museums on the southern end of the city  If however you plan on shopping or spending time north of the river you should probably stay farther up on Michigan  You can always take a cab or the Hotel shuttle but neither are as convenient as being a short walk from all the activities The only real negative to the hotel was the elevators  With the hotel being quite large it was no surprise to find the elevators somewhat sluggish at peak times  Although for most people it really doesnt matter I did notice that the tv was rather small for the size of the room Overall it was a good stay  I wouldnt mind staying there again but would probably select another  star hotel a little closer to the action  
P => Lovely Historic Hotel   Service Not So Great The Chicago Hilton and Towers is a lovely historic hotel   beautiful ballrooms wood paneling and ble in the foyer  Historic also means some problems with AC noise and elevator speed  I was there for a week for a large conference  The hotel does seem a little quotdarkquot as mentioned in previous reviews but I think this is due to the style   very heavy wood paneling  The first room I was in was small but sufficient for one person  The king bed was VERY comfortable and I had a lovely view to the lake  However during the weekend live music was playing until late into the night   all of which could be heard in my room while I was trying to go to sleep  Unfortunately the bathtub didnt drain very well several other people also mentioned this while I was there  Furthermore halfway through my stay my neighbors ided to turn up their TV to full volume  I could hear it loud and clear over my television  I called security and they came up  Of course nobody answered the door so security called downstairs and advised about the situation they even mentioned that the noise level was obscenely high   you could hear it all the way down the hall  The noise continued despite repeated phone calls by security  I finally asked to be moved to another room only to be initially told that no other rooms were available  I was put on hold and magically one opened up  I was moved downstairs to another room with a king bed  This room was much larger with two large windows overlooking the lake  Overall I was pleased with the rooms especially since the tub in the second room drained normally  However the service left something to be desired  The second day I was there nobody showed up to clean the room  I finally called at  pm and was told that someone should have already been there  They came up after I called  The next day the same thing happened  I think the housekeeping service thought I was calling for additional services but in reality I was calling because I never had service to begin with  The third day they still hadnt cleaned  By the time someone came up after I called I told them to forget it because I was in for the night  A stop at the front desk fixed the problem for the remainder of the week  The AC was frightfully inadequate in the meeting rooms and foyer of the hotel  It was very hot and humid in Chicago and many of us sweated inside the hotel  When asked about the temperature in the meeting rooms we were always told it was a quotunion problem quot We were lucky if things got fixed within a few hours  The food at the meal functions was mediocre at best despite the fact that the meals were supposed to be high end  We waited  minutes between finishing our salads and being served the main course  Some of the serving plates and cups were filthy   see photo of quotclean coffee cup quot Waitstaff was brusque union employees  Could not use the fitness center without paying  per day despite the fact that Im an HHonors member   at Hyatt you get in free as a frequent guest  Overall the hotel certainly did not live up to my expectations  
P => Great stay for the price Came to Chicago on ust th for my dhters th birthday  I was taking her my stepson and stepdhter to the Cubs game  We had a no frills room booked at the Howard Johnson for   This was the best rate I could find and since it was for one day and we were going to the game who needed frills and a swimming pool  Also the HOJO had free parking  While checking Hotwire one day they had a  star in Chicago with a pool for   So I booked the room and it was the Hilton Towers  We ided not to drive into the city so we drove to Michigan City and took the South Shore line train into the city  I went to tripadvisor and read the reviews of this hotel and was a little worried about the other person who booked through hotwire  No problems here  We walked in and were wowed by the lobby  What a beautiful hotel  We got to our room and we had two double beds  Plenty of room for all of us  The room was well lit clean bright and airy  There were only two towles in the room  One call to housekeeping and just minutes later we were given extra towles  Kids swam in the pool and had a blast  The concierge gave me an excellent tip on where to take the kids for a fun dinner ESPN Zone and he was right on the money  The next morning we had breakfast at the Pavillion and the food was great a little pricey but what do you expect  The only bad part about the trip was my Cubs got hammered    But it was a birthday my dhter will never forget  
P => Great Location Stayed at the Hilton Towers    This hotel is in a great location right across from the parks  If you enjoy an evening stroll this is the place for youOur room was comfortable quiet and clean  Housekeeping had our rooms cleaned by  am each day  The hotel was full to capacity  The lobby areas were busy and noisy  However the rooms were very quiet and I tend to be sensitive to noise Public transportation is no problem several el stations are within walking distance  We walked to the Ogivie Center to take the metra to Glen Ellyn where our dhterson in law live  The walk was an easy  minute walk We obtained a good rate on the Hilton Website night We will definitely stay here again 
P => So depressing Ive stayed here several times for business  If I could chose a different hotel I certainly would  The interior of the hotel is dark and depressing the rooms are small you have to pay an additional fee to use the fitness facilities the restaurant The Pavillion is TERRIBLE   avoid it at all costs and the bar Kitty OSheas is not much better  Overall this is a lackluster overpriced place to stay  
P => Enjoyed our stay We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for  nights in y on business  Our view of the lake was wonderful  The room was spacious and clean  The public areas were gorgeous  I forked over the  for the gym and it was worth it I took the shuttle to shopping which was very convenient  Nice place 
P => Beautiful Older Hotel Stayed here for three nights over the th of y weekend  Chose this hotel because if its location across the street from Grant Park where the fireworks can be seen  Beautiful old hotel well maintained  We had a king bed very comfortable with quality linens and very comfortable mattress  We did learn that the standard rooms with two double beds are much larger than the standard rooms with a king bed older adult family members stayed in one of the double bedded rooms  Nice bathroom very clean  The public areas of this hotel are magnificient  The lobby is beautiful as are the ballrooms  We ate at the Irish pub in the hotel  good food and the most reasonably priced of all the restaurants in the hotel  If youre physically able to walk any distance this hotel is conveniently located to the Shedd Aquarium Field Museum and Adler Planetarium  We didnt find very many restaurants close by other than in the hotel  
P => Love the bed Best hotel bed I have ever slept on Rooms were nice and clean  With  women sharing the room we extremely appreciated the  bathrooms  We had a great view of the lake very pretty in the morning  Plus it was a quick walk to the shore  Always had hot water for showers  Pool was nice with an outside k for lounging  Oh if you want to use the exercise facilities plan on  a day for access  
P => Nice hotel but whats with the guests My husband and I stayed here for  days returning y th  I priily chose this hotel for its location walking distance to museums lakefront etc  and the spa  We greatly enjoyed both  We started every morning with a visit to the sauna hot tubs and pool then showered and headed out to various attractions  This hotel is within walking distance of the Art Institute the Shedd Aquarium Field Museum and Adler Planetatium  We also walked to the Chicago River for an architectural cruise but that might be a bit far for some others The only real problem we had with the hotel was our fellow quotguests quot During our stay several conventions landed there including a group of Bible Bowlers several hundred middle American families with preteen and teenaged children competing in a bible trivia contest a horde of Pampered Chef ladies and some others  Is it a Midwest tradition that because you have rented a number of rooms in a hotel you have the right to take over common areas such as the elevator lobbies on every floor for group meetings These group meetings consisted of   teens or Pampered Chefs sitting barefoot on the floor of the lobby area whooping and hollering playing card games and eating take out pizza It was most disconcerting and I cannot imagine why the hotel management did not discreetly direct these folks to a private gathering area Unfortunately this kind of behavior damaged our experience of an otherwise lovely hotel  I hope the Hilton staff will find a way to deal with such lack of civility  
P => Fantastic hotel I cannot undestand the other negative reviews I have just returned from a  night stay at this hotel and I found it wonderful  It is a very majestic hotel and our room on the th floor was huge it was a smoking room  It had  large beds and  bathrooms loads of white fluffy towels massive TV a coffee machine mini bar etc etc  The only tiny complaints I had was that there was no coffee in the room on arrival and on my way out I asked the desk staff who assured me it would be there on my return from a night out     no it wasnt  Also the lifts were continually busy but it was th y and the hotel looked to be exceptionally busy but  minute waits at a time seemed extreme Other than those  minor issues we loved the hotel loved the rooms loved the beds and the bedding was divine loved the location      if we return to Chicago which I hope we do then without a shadow of a doubt we would stay here again but perhaps take a coffee bag with us in readiness 
P => A great hotel It is absolutly a beutiful hotel  My family was in town just for pleasure this was the first time we were in Chicago The location is ideal just in front of the park overlooking the lake  Only one block walking to the event of Taste of Chicago two blocks to the lake  The lobby is classy  We arrived around  pm check in was very quickly  I booked two rooms for two nights I was able to get one room with double bed and two ble baths one room with king bed with ble bath they were in the same floor  Both with the view of Lake and park  I was very satisfied  The rooms were clean well orated  The beds were comfy  My dhter loved it she said this was one of the best hotel we ever stayed The breakfast buffey in the hotel is so so  The gentleman in the front desk that we asked for information of attractions in the town was not helpful it made us almost waste a day  The self parking garage should have better way connect to the hotel Overall if I come back to chicago again I will stay in this hotel  
P => All I can say is amazing with Class    After reading some of these reviews I was scared to check into the Hilton Chicago  I dont know why people make up stories this hotel is amazing and so classy  From the time we checked in till we departed the staff was always there for us and always treated us with so much respect  Our room was ready when we arrived at am which was a bonus because we didnt have to hang around and our room was so impressive for the money we had  bathrooms you never get that no where unless you have a suite  When I come back to Chicago no doubt it will be back to this hotel I wont even think twice  Trust me when you walk through those front doors and through that lobby your jaw will drop at how beautiful it is its classic with trimmings that are out of this world  Very impressed with this hotel and would give it more than a  star  
P => Placing non smokers in smoking rooms I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during the month of e and was appalled by their lackadasical policy regarding room reservations  The room which I had requested as a non smoking room wasnt even ready when I got there  Several hours later I finally got one but the hotel informed me they were quotoutquot of non smoking rooms and would have to put me in a smoking room for the night  Then they said they couldnt guarantee me a non smoking room for the remaining three nights Id be there  As an asthma sufferer I was appalled A friend who had stayed at the Hilton warned me that theyd treated her the same way that shed been given a smoking room when shed requested a non smoking room  We both had similar experiences the rooms wreaked of smoke and opening the windows didnt help  When I ran the shower the smoke smell intensified  I spent the night with the covers over me blocking out the smell and suffering from a tight chest and a runny nose  They had promised to put an ionizer in the room but that never happened The only thing they did to accommodate me was reduce the rate of the room In the morning I got this non apologetic message on my phone telling me theyd be unable to change the room  Then they lied and said my reservation never specified a non smoking room  Livid I called the front desk told them I had asthma that I did in fact have a reservation for a non smoking room and that their policy of overbooking rooms was a disgrace  I guess my complaints had some effect because a half hour later I was transferred to a non smoking room  Considering how expensive the Hilton Chicago is I should not have had to work this hard to get a comfortable room I later found out that they were giving other non smokers smoking rooms even the day before I arrived I hope this review alerts hotels to the fact that they should honor reservations and not overbook  Plus they should think about converting more of their smoking rooms to non smoking rooms  Most people dont smoke and these greedy policies will deter people from patronizing luxurious hotels like the Hilton Incidentally the Hilton in New Orleans did the same thing when I stayed there a few years ago  Based on my experiences chains like the Hyatt and the riott do a much better job of accommodating their guests  
P => Nothing but Class With all of the choices available to stay in Chicago   choosing a hotel is a task all in itself  BUT because I have been a Hilton Honors member for a number of years I will always start with the Hilton chain  Im proud to say I hit the jackpot on this one  Just walking into the hotel is an experience  Youll find yourself in The Great Hall  Its ble and stone not glass and steel  Its as if you left the States and entered a grand European Hotel  I was there with my husband who was on business  We checked in on a Thursday evening and then were scheduled to move to The Drake Hotel another Hilton property on Friday  The Hilton Chicago was able to book us the following day and were able to keep us in the same room  Quite impressive when the American Medical Association was holding their conference in the hotel  They still found room for us  No need to move  Im really not much for big cities and crowds so while my husband was away for the day on Friday I stayed in the hotel  The room was so comfortable I probably wouldnt have left but the housekeeper talked me into enjoying myself outside of the room too  She was very sweet and most informative about the area  She was the one that told me the hotel offered a free shopping shuttle that ran all day long  Even though I didnt go I thought that was a great feature since getting around that city is almost impossbile unless youre on foot  The pool area on the th floor was very nice even though it was an indoor pool there is a great sun k just off the pool area  There is nothing in the hotel directory letting you know about this k  I wish I would have known earlier in the day because that is what I really wanted to do  The room was beautiful but it was the bed that would make me come back for sure  It was absolutely the most comfortable hotel bed my husband and I have ever slept in  Another nice touch were the books and magazines that outlined everything to do and eat in the city  There was also a book written by Mr  Hilton himself that outlined the generations of his family and the history of the Hilton chain which I enjoyed very much  I would have liked to have bathrobes provided especially with that caliber of room  The view was well   there wasnt one unless you like looking at the side of a brick building  They do have Lake Michigan views for a minimal  per night extra however those rooms were booked  We had dinner at their signature restaurant Buckinghams  Wow I ate a  oz TBone that was one of the best steaks of my life  I highly recommend it  This hotel was once known as the biggest hotel in the world  Some of the most famous and influential people in the world have stayed there  The hotel is located on Michigan Ave right across the street from a beautiful park  It is in the heart of the convention world but so close to all that most come to the windy city for  Please go and enjoy this hotel  You will remember it for some time to come but beware it will be hard to accept anything less in the future  A note With regard to my husband and I being Hilton Honor members I felt that we should have received a little more than  free bottles of water  
P => Too expensive for such a mediocre hotel I stayed at the Hilton from   for small conference  I thought the hallways were dingy and dark the rooms standard the bathroom small and not as clean as it could be and the beds wonderful  I expected A LOT more for  a night thank god I didnt pay for it  No mini fridge or microwave in the room  The desk clerks were really nice helping us out with finding nice restaurants in the area  Since Im a smoker I appreciated being able to smoke just about everywhere in the hotel rooms hallways outside the elevators so non smokers take note Overall it served its purpose but I probably wouldnt stay there again  
P => Very average for the price I stay in Chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the Chicago Hilton  I pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest  This Hilton is not up to par  Its clean and the front desk staff is nice but in Chicago The Drake Doubletree Guest Suites and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton and less expensive Compared to other Hilton properties in Chicago the rooms were not as well appointed the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice the TV was tiny the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a  star hotel If youre going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels you can do far better than this place  
P => Got an Upgrade on Priceline Beautiful Hotel We loved this hotel  The beds were super comfy  There were beautiful linens lots of feather pillows a down comforter super soft sheets great service clean lots of nice restaurants good location  We stayed here for  after receiving a free upgrade on priceline  We received a room with two double beds and two bathrooms which was wonderfully convenient  The staff were also wonderful very friendly and helpful  
P => Beautiful Hotel Gracious Staff I recently visited Chicago with  of my girlfriends to celebrate my th birthday  The staff was very accomodating and helpful  The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful and I could see why several movies had been filmed at this location  I told my son that he could just go ahead and plan to have his wedding reception held at the Chicago Hilton  The location was great and everything was easily accessible with either a shuttle rail or taxi  The luggage room was very nice for people that werent catching a flight out until later in the day  The entire staff took very good care of us from guest services laundery to housekeeping bell captain and concierge  I would not hesitate to recommend or stay here again  Having Buddy Guys Legend directly behind the hotel was great too 
P => Elegant hotel good location average service Just spent  days at this Hilton  It has a lot of wonderful things going for it  The location is very good   on Michigan Ave across from the largest park in Chicago and very close to the lake and to a number of bars and restaurants The rooms were well appointed though a little tight  Linens furniture and other appointments were rather nice  The beds were extremely comfortable The best part of the hotel relates to its history  When it was built I think in the s or s it was the largest hotel in the area  Be sure to look up when you first enter as the high ceiling features an enormous elegant mural detailed accents and beautiful lighting  I nearly missed it the first two days never having looked upSo why only  stars A couple of reasons  First though elegant rooms were somewhat tight  This was expected but still I think of this as a negative  Priily though the service was lackluster  I asked for a king room with a rollaway there were  of us booked the hotel months ago and was told no such rooms were available  We had to check our bags and come back a few hours later and then the only king room was extremely small so we settled for a room with two doubles   not a great option for two tall people and their dhter  What bothered me was the very clear secondary way we were treated  The hotel had conventions and we being of a smaller party were clearly not that important  One shining light   the bellman was extremely helpful and brought us complimentary wine and cookies  He seemed genuinely concerned and helpful  Also a goofy practice   the bell desk will not check computers  They were going to let us walk around town for hours with our computers until they relented after our plea  Housekeepers were very friendly and courteous A sidebar   I will never understand the unwillingness of a hotel to take the extra effort to confirm the room type requested at reservation  I understand that they cannot guarantee such things as many things could interfere   accidents repairs guests overstaying their reservation  What they should and CAN do though is slot you for such rooms if available when reserved with some caveat quot   unless certain things interfere like X Y or Zquot  I used to ket reservation systems so I know they can do this  They choose not to which is disappointing OK a little off topic sorryThe breakfast restaurant was good   a wide assortment on the breakfast buffet omelette station and menu items with good service  Its a little pricey but not above quotChicago prices quot The Irish bar whose name I forget was fun though they always seemed understaffed so service was slow  Plus they close at a in a town with a am curfew   whats up with thatWhile in Chicago we dined at Spiaggias  Outstanding food though the portions made French restaurants look generous by comparison  Also try the South Loop Club not too far a good quotregularquot bar with fun people working it  We also went to the White Sox at their quotnewquot ballpark   great time easy to get to via subway I do recommend this hotel particularly with discount rates we paid night  Expect a quality stay but with a few things such as service lagging a true luxury hotel  
P => Nice  but staff is disinterested I stayed at the Hilton while in town on business for two nights  The staff at this hotel could greatly benefit from customer service training  Front desk personnel appear disinterested and troubled by having to check you in  I travel frequently on business and this is the first time upon checking in at a Hilton gold club member that I had to ask if a tower room was available  A shake of front desk clerks head quotnoquot was the response I received although a colleague of mine checked in after me and was given the upgrade Room airconditioning didnt work properly   wont stay here again when in Chicago  
P => Great Hotel great price Got a good rate through priceline and for   more got a lakefront room with a beautiful view  Fast check in and great service during stay  Buffet breakfast was plentiful and ent price  Room was nice and bed very comfortable  Only complaint smoking allowed in lobby on each floor by the elevators  
P => Overall a good stay Got a great rate for one night on a weekend  The hotel is huge and very crowded  lots of families and large groups  Still if you ask for a quiet room the hotel is large enough that its easy to get away from the hubbub  Be aware that when you book those great rates however they usually dont offer a view of Grant Park and the lake  According to the lady at the front desk this is  extra Sure the hotel is a tad worn here and there but the quotbadquot elements of the hotels age carpet a bit faded in the hallways electrical outlets and light switches yellowed are far outweighed by the good which gives the hotel its grandeur and elegance  The lobby area is classy yet not too stuffy mostly because the throngs of people that inhabit it are obviously tourists  I didnt visit any of the hotels restaurants or bar although I thought they looked equally elegant  like something from a movie and probably very pricey As for the room the bed definitely was a highlight quality comforter and linens plush pillow top mattress and pillows  I slept great and the room they gave me was very quiet  I had just a regular sized room with a king bed and I thought it was plenty roomy in line with what I paid  Didnt have any of the climate control problems referenced here in other posts  Large TV big bathroom with lots of ble and the water pressure in the shower was one of the best Ive ever had at a hotel My main beef with the hotel aside from the rather crowded and chaotic public areas had to do with the business center  Sorry Hilton but its time to bring this element of your hotel into the st Century  Guests want  hour access to the internet and it should be free as is done at the Hilton Garden Inn across the river  I like to print out my airline boarding passes at the hotel before I ever get to the airport but this was not possible at this hotel  For one thing the business center has very limited hours  I had to leave for the airport in the morning before the place even opened  Second of all the Hilton charges  per every  minutes of internet use  Not an incentive for me to make a return visit when other hotels charge nothing  Finally the computer stations themselves did not appear to be in very good condition  all but one of the computers and printers didnt even look operational to me  More attention definitely needs to be given in this area But all in all I enjoyed staying in a hotel with quothistoryquot and character that for the most part has been kept up pretty well  I would consider a return visit if it was a quotdownquot time for the hotel meaning not too crowded and if the business center and its policies were updated  
P => The Best Hotel Bed EVER Otherwise not so thrilled We stayed the weekend at the Hilton for the Bears Convention  We booked for two adults and one child  Upon making my reservation I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a executive level room for a fair price  I agreed  Upon getting to the room it contained one kind size bed  There was no place for my child to sleep  No other rooms were available so we had to bring in a roll away bed which took up whatever remaining floor space was in this already too small room  There was a large chair which protruded from the desk and would not fit under it that took up the remaining floor space  I walked into that thing at least a dozen times  The room was HOT  We turned off the heat opened the windows for the whole stay and we were still uncomfortable  There were numerous dirty dishes sitting outside of rooms many remained late into the next morning when we saw them there the night before  There was continental breakfast   and evening hor devors   for executive level rooms  I am someone who prefers bottled water to a morning coffee and was pleased to find they offered it the first day only  After that they said they ran out and it was never offered for the rest of the weekend  Food options are limited andor expensive in the restaurants  Really nothing for children at all  Altho they will make you a   grilled cheese for the asking  I had Sheppards Pie at Kitty OSheas on evening  It was WONDERFUL The best thing about this hotel was the BED  Best Hotel Bed Ever So comfortable  Slept like a baby  and I normally do not sleep well in a hotel  I wanted to bring that bed home with me  along with the pillows and blankets  Truly the very best sleep you can have in a hotel  Im not sure if the level of service was down because it was just a quotBears Conventionquot or what  But I was disappointed in the service being this is a Hilton Hotel  
P => Perfect stay Staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me  We got a great rate        on Priceline  Close to the subway red line and we got from OHare to the hotel in less than an hour for   for both of us  We were able to check in more than  hours early  Room was great    very clean good closet space and fantastic bedding  Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar but the bartenders advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price  Concierge was helpful too  Overall service was terrific room was great and staying there was a treat  I would stay there again any time especially at that price  
P => Fine historic hotel in the Loop Stayed one Sunday evening with a  rate through Priceline  The rooms were recently remodeled and have down comforter tons of pillows and two bathrooms  The standard is not overly huge but certainly comfortbale enough for two adults  Pool is on the th floor where we stayed  There was a lot of traffic through the hallways  Request different floor if youre looking for quiet  Of course we happened to be there on high school dance competition weekend The hotel has a lot of history and the artwork or make for a very grand surrounding  Judging by photos on walls many presidents have stayed here  To address previous reviewers complaints There is a wet bar in the room keys are offered upon check in  It does not matter how you book the room  Wet bar rates are always outrageous  If you want a room with view just ask  You  be turned down but we must have hit a friendly check in person and were accomodated  Yes there is  parking but welcome to Chicago  We parked the car and took taxis everywhere at average cost of per ride  Highly recommed taking cab to Rosebud Steakhouse if looking for mouthwatering fine dining Breakfast at the The Pavilion was pretty subpar and cost  for two people  The buffet was not set up but is normally   Cant recommed eating here  Experience overall was very good for large hotel  
P => Very good Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Towers for  days and found it to be one of the most comfortable hotels we have stayed at in America  The room was large with a view over the park it was very clean and the service very good only downside was the fact that it was a slight distance walking back from the shops with all our bargains Well done Hilton Towers  
P => Absolutely wonderful My husband and I stayed at the Chicago Hilton and Towers this past New Years Eve and had a wonderful experience  It was packed at check in but guests were served lemonade while they waited  A staff member made an announcement that there were additional check in counters if you didnt mind the walk to the luggage check in counter at the other end of the hotel  I didnt so I walked over Upon getting to the counter about a ten minute wait I realized I didnt have my credit card I had left it at home in a larger purse  Since I was checking in alone and would be met by my husband and friends later I panicked especially after hearing a woman being told she HAD to have a credit card or wait in the longer line at the real check in counter to leave the mandatory deposit because it was New Years Eve  I was told not to worry about it and was given my key immediately  I was given a lakeview to view the fireworks room on the highest possible floor that was not a suite   My room was located very close to the elevator the beds were extremely comfortable everyone received a late checkout time of pm and the two bathrooms were wonderful  Although I was given a room with two double beds my husband and I took advantage and slept alone for the first time in years  My friends had a larger tv but who cared   it was New Years  It was a wonderful experience especially on what was probably the busiest night of the year  
P => expecting more Stayed Thrusday Sunday of New Years  Hotel looks beautiful ble lobby room looks nice but was too hot  Air conditioner was ancient had to keep windows open  Got a good deal with online rates but still for the price I thought I would get continental breakfast morning paper refrigerator in room alas none of that  Parking was expensive at  but great location especially for walkers like myself  Millenium park is right across the street  Sure there were homeless people in the area and if you can afford to stay at this hotel you can afford to give them a buck and not be afraid like some of the other reviewers  
P => Great Stay My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a large corporate party  The room appeared to have recently been reated had that quotnew housequot smell and was very nice and exceptionally clean  We had requested a king size bed and were disappointed when there were none available at check in but the desk clerk was very nice and did give us a room with a lake view  We loved having two bathrooms to get ready for the party The party itself was also very nice with great food and I would recommend this hotel for anyone planning a special event as well  All in all a great stay 
P => Nice Place A Bit Off The Beaten Path My wife and I ended up in this hotel after grabbing a deal on Hotwire  We paid just over night including tax  For that money we certainly couldnt complain  The room was small by American standards but we werent planning on spending our three days in Chicago in the hotel room  The king bed was very comfortable the bathroom large enough with ent counter space the closet roomy the pillows were luxurious the entire room was very clean and the climate control system was prehistoric but warm as we were there in ember  The line for check in was long but moved quickly  On the downside its a little bit of a walk a couple short blocks through a slightly seedy area to the L  Walking to anything significant is a longer trek except that the walk along Michigan Aveue is nice  Our sixth floor room was quiet even though it faced Michigan Avenue  We had a view of Lake Michigan Soldier Field and the park  All in all very nice and certainly a good value  
P => Hilton Chicago The Hilton Chicago Hotel located on South Michigan Hotel is a lovely old historical hotel graced by former US Presidents and Queen Elizabeth  The entrance lobby from South Michigan Avenue is ornate in neo classical style  I had a room on the th floor executive floor and it was clean comfortable and with all the facilities of a deluxe hotel  At the time of my stay the executive lounge on the th floor was closed for reation  The hotel is a short  minute walk to the Harrison Red Line station and just opposite Grant Park  I would certainly recommend the Chicago Hilton to any visitor to Chicago  
P => My favorite place in the Windy City The Chicago Hilton on Michigan Avenue is the BEST hotel Ive stayedat in the US  What a great experience I have stayed there twice and will certainly stay there every time Im in Chicago  My husband and I were there last week and they gave us an upgrade to a gorgeous room with a view  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the staff helped us out with a luggage delivery problem that took a lot of their time but theywere friendly and gracious throughout  Kudos to the Hilton 
P => The location to be during the Chicago athon We stayed here  years ago and then again in  for the Chicago athon  Yes check in is chaotic but this is a prime weekend in Chicago so youll find any hotel booked to capacity and chaotic  The best part is being able to roll right out to Grant Park  This location is great any other time of the year for those who are hitting the Musuem Campus  Next time we go back we are going to Room  four blocks south for their fabulous breakfasts The location is also convenient to a  hour JewelOsco grocery store and the red line L  Years ago when we lived in Chicago the further south you go the less amenities so it is great to see the revitalization in this neighborhood  
P => A very tired hotel Went in e    for the Supercomm Show The Lobby is great the check in staff in chaos as I had pre paid my room in the UK  After much confusion I was shown to my room   but only after I paid for it again ok they refunded it Monday but even so and the room was ok   brilliant  years ago but now it is very tired paint peeling etc Overall it was lower than OK I would never stop there again as it was away from the action and a bit tired and worn  Had I paid half the price then the review would be different 
P => Wonderful Experience My husband and I recently stayed at the Chicago Hilton and Towers for  nights We booked the hotel through a travel agent at       tax  The hotel is beautiful and is convenient to all of the downtown attractions  It includes a complimentary breakfast an athletic clubtrack gym swimming pool and sauna etc  The room was clean but small   and the staff was very helpful  I really enjoyed my stay and would love to stay there again  
P => Beautiful Recently stayed here in tember for  days  We stayed on the th floor which had just opened the week prior following reations  We had  double beds PLUS  bathrooms Location was great  Unfortunately front desk staff were unsure of quite a lot of things and couldnt really help us with our queries ie internet access in our rooms This wasnt our choice of hotel for Chicago but Im glad the travel agent did put us in here  If this hotel is in your budget I recommend staying here  
P => Fantastic Hotel   a must stay  I stayed at this hotel with  of my friends over St Patricks day in ch   Everyone agreed that it was a fabulous place to stay  A lovely orated lobby with lovely bedrooms including a coffee machine and iron A gym sauna sunbed great pool and  spas are all great too Breakfast although quite expensive was very nice St Patricks day was a very fun day in the hotel bar with very friendly staff All in all a must stay hotel  
P => Nice place sketchy walk to el nice pool Stayed at this hotel the first week of tember  after finding a great deal on Hotwire  The room was small but most are in this downtown  We were given a corner room on the th floor with window views quotas a surprisequot from the nice lady at the front desk  We had views down to navy pier and over the lake  The staff was very warm and solicitous smiling and asking what we needed  The area is a little sketchy in terms of the walk to the el station and at night I would definitely use a cab  One member of our party was pickpocketed in broad daylight at the el station on the way back to the airport  As far as facilities the Irish pub is fun and had Irish live music  The pool is clean and the two hot tubs have extra strength jets  But if you choose to work out even as a guest there is a fee  Overall a very nice hotel and I would say terrific for the cost  
P => Great Experience I stayed at the Hilton because it was downtown and I got a room with  king bed for      tax per night  I had dinner at the Pavillion inside the hotel and the service was superb  My shower looked dirty so I took my showers in the Athletic Club  
P => Way too much money for this place We ided to stay here as a treat because of some of the reviews  Boy was this place bad  When you walk in it has a gorgeous lobby  But thats where it ends  The service was so bad  They didnt even help us with our bags when we got there  The rooms were ent sized but so run down  I can see that the hotel was nice at one time or another but not now  Save your money and find a place for half the price down the street  The location is great but there are several other hotels nearby that offer all the same amenities and convenience for a lot less  
P => Hit or miss  Sometimes this hotel is fabulous   quick friendly service great room speedy room service And sometimes   well it just isnt  We live in the burbs but often have weekend functions downtown so Ive stayed here a lot  First of all forget about getting a ent reasonably priced breakfast here  The breakfast options are limited and generally of low quality  Many of the rooms are very nice   but Ive also been in ones that are terrible   in need of updating repairs and located in very noisy areas of the hotel  I once asked to be changed from a room which was located at the entrance to the pool across from maid service amp vending to make it even better   and it took  minutes about  phone calls and lots of irritation before they moved me to a room which had seen better days  Avoid it on holiday weekends where the staff is stretched way too thin   one time we went down to the vallet after trying to call ahead for our car and receiving a busy signal for about  minutes only to find they had taken the phone off the hook because too many people were calling  Then had to wait another  minutes for our vehicle  I think there are a lot of hotels in the price range and cheaper which offer a more consistent experience  
P => Stay here if you can This is the place in Chicago to experience at least once     it is a grand hotel  From the beautifully orated lobby to the wonderful rooms most with two bathrooms you will know why folks want to stay here  Good food especially the breakfasts good room service good beds just an all around nice place  I love the HiltonChicago 
P => What a great stay The Chicago Hilton and Towers is always a great place to stay  Great service accessiblity and super amenities  My favorite room is the two bathroom double in the Executive Towers  Always a great view of Grant Park and the Lake it truly is a Chicago Landk  Super shuttle to all shopping up the Avenue great room service  Worth the stay  
P => Great rooms boring restaurants I stayed in this hotel recently and was very impressed by the front lobby and ballrooms  My room was also quite pleasant  But the restaurants and registration areas were strangely bland and formulaic  This is undoubtedly due to the convention nature of the hotel but I was still disappointed to note that such an obviously historic hotel was lacking any distinctive bars and restaurants With that said this is a very clean and attractive hotel with a great staff  Upper level rooms have amazing views of both the lake and city  This is an excellent choice for either convention or business travel  
P => This hotel was great  I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention    ch   The hotel is beautiful  I had a Towers room  I had a ent view of the city Sears Tower  The room was a little small but had two bathrooms  King bed  The Tower room has its own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day  The registration lounge is on the th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan  The hotel was full but service was excellent  The location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two especially toward the El train  We loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car  I will stay here again  Hilton offered a Sunday night free on their website with a  day stay  This made the cost reasonable for Chicago  However the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired  The pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink  
P => Great Stay I stayed in the hotel for a week and had a great stay the staff was helpful and courteous  The only problems I saw were that the television was too small and the Internet access was poor  I would and will stay in this hotel again  
P => Would stay here again  
P => whats all the hoopla  
P => Anti climatic  
P => Great Lake Views  
P => Time for some remodeling  
P => The Hilton is nice and tidy with an awsome staff  
P => Beautiful Hotel with Great staff  
P => Nice Hotel  
P => I expected a lot better service  
P => Molto lussuoso ma esageratamente caro  
P =>   
P => un tuffo nella storia della citta       
P => Na pas les moyens de son image de luxe  
P => impresionante mansion  
P => 
P => Great spot for a meeting Staff at the hotel made planning a meeting a piece of cake Their event coordinator worked with me to take care of all the details reserving rooms meeting room setup planning the menus even dinner reservations  The staff also checked in several times throughout the day to make sure things were going smoothly  The meeting room was very plush   comfy leather chairs executive table whiteboard however the best part of this hotel is its convenient location   our travelers were happy to be checked in within minutes of landing  The Business Center and UPS store made it easy to sendreceive packages make copies etc  The Andiamo restaurant has great food though the portions are small and very pricey  The rooms are basic but comfortable  Water pressure in the shower was great and the bed was nice and soft with lots of pillows  I was on the third floor and directly across from the airport but had no trouble sleeping   the curtains are thick enough to block out the lights and the fan in the room provides enough white noise to cover the flights coming intaking off  Be aware Wi fi isnt free and the room service has very limited hours  While this isnt the place to go on with friends or for a romantic trip it certainly fits the bill for a business meeting  
P => Very comfy   but whats up with the wifi United put me up here after they delayed me and I missed a connection  I went straight to the bar  The drinks were quite pricey but after joking and chatting with the bartender about my crappy day the second drink was pretty strong the first one wasnt bad either  The room was quite clean without any of the its been remodeled once too many times and could use it again look that so many hotel rooms have  I found it comfy  It was plenty quiet but I arived late and left early so I dont know how noise from traffic would be And it had my holy grail of hotel room features an automatic thermostat No more low heat white noise all nightBut Hilton Staff    per day for internet access Wilson tango foxtrot And it didnt even work that well  TO their credit when I mentioned it upon checkout the clerk gave me contact info for a possible refund it isnt through Hilton and a coupon for breakfast  
P => slightly better than sleeping in airport For the cost of the hotel I would expect a nicer quieter room  I requested a room on a high floor away from the elevator and got a room on the rd floor next to the elevator and ice machine  The or was dingy and poorly lit the thermostat did not work and I could hear every airplane every car on the road below every adjacent room noise and noise in the hallway all night long Next time I will travel off the airport grounds for lodging despite the convenience of location  
P => Its all about the location Theres really only one reason to stay here and thats the location  You can bascially fly to ORD and go the hotel wo ever going outside  And catching your return flight home is super easy  Other than that theres not much to recommend about this hotel  Rooms and food are average  Restaurant and bar are uninspiring  However the gym is very nice  
P => Convenient hotel at Chicago Airport Ive stayed at this hotel many times  Best feature is that it is attached to OHare airport so incredibly convenient when missed connectionunintended stay in Chicago or early morning flight  Like nice fitness center in room coffee makers quiet rooms comfortable bed  Biggest complaint is lack of in room safe  Room price varies significantly  
P => Perfect Location for a stop over The location of the hotel is perfect just in a walking distance of nearlyall terminals  The check in is mor ethan quick the rooms are in avery good state I ordered an allergy friendly room and the check out was easy as well  What else do you want     Wellof course the prices in the hotel are high but again you willsave on cab fares if you stay for just a night  
P => Seems to live by its location alone Great location and a reasonably comfortable hotel but    The bathroom was dreadful a powerful mould smell that should have been noticed by who ever cleaned the room Nickel and diming   a  chargfe for a plastic razor the type that Motel s give free to those travellers who  have forgotten them The restaurant is good if expensive with very mediocre service in the morning However a comfortable bed great location and in the world of Location Location Location it i a good place to stay 
P => great airport location but  and d to death I stayed in this hotel for one night on the last day of a business trip because I needed to take an early flight out the next day  The location couldnt be beat all you had to do was walk through and underground tunnel and there you were right at the terminal  It sure beats driving to the airport in the wee hours of the morning without any breakfast  Plus I got a reasonable rate because I was traveling on government business and a free upgrade because Im a Hilton Gold member  But they really kill you on the extras here  You not only pay for the internet here but its about twice what I have paid anywhere else in the US  Breakfast was around  and even the business center charged for computer usage and printing  It was worth it for the convenience but be forwarned that youl pay for it one way of the other  
P => Excellent airport hotel with easy access to ORD Stayed here one night   This hotel is my airlines designated crew hotel  As such the rate is pre negotiated  Access to the hotel could not be simpler  there is one underground walkway that leads directly to the hotel from the baggage reclaim areas  You do not ever have to be outside exposed to the elements  Escalators and elevators are available for those with mobility issues or largebulky baggage  It would take you approximately  to  to walk from hotel front desk to airport check in level  Since the OHare Airport is a terminus station for the CTAs Chicago Transit Authority Blue line train you can easily take the train into downtown Chicago and back to the airport The hotel itself is wonderful and it was recently remodeled   all guest rooms and most of the hotel amenities and public areas  The hotel has a full gym with medium sized indoor pool  The hotel sells annual gym memberships so that a traveler  use the gym and showers while in transit at ORD  Check in was efficient but as a crew member my room is already pre assigned and pre paid thus very little processing required My room was on the smaller size but was very well laid out  Queen sized bed   firm but with a soft mattress pad and down comforter  A choice of three pillows feather hypo allergenic and foam are available upon request  The room was set in a warm redorange and cinnamon color palette accented with light natural woods  The windows are floor to ceiling and are double pained and glazed   As a result despite being less than  meters from one of the most busy runways in America the noise level is hardly noticeable at all  Additionally you feel little of the summer heat nor winter chills thru the glass  The room comes with quotblack outquot draped and when closed render the room nearly pitch dark despite mid day light conditions  Central HVAC allows you to control the exact temperature of your room within a set range The bathroom is well stocked and furnished    A supply of basic toiletries are standard as well nice milled bath soaps  There is an attached to wall hair dryer and a small no fog mirror with magnification  The tub is deep and allows you to enjoy a full soak if you desire  The water pressure is excellent and the water is hot My room had a new flat screen remote TV with most major cable channels and a selection of foreign language options  The full length closet had a half sized ironing board and iron and an in room coffee maker and supplies  There was a fair sized work desk with good lighting and multiple electricity outlets so you can plug in several items at the same time  Everything in my room was working properly and it had been cleaned and serviced thoroughly by the housekeeping staff The hotel has  room service at typical room service prices  The menu however is surprisingly diverse and has several heart quothealthyquot options that are not commonly found on hotel room service menus   grilled fish chicken salads etc  Sit down dining options include a mid range restaurant with traditional American cuisine a casual sports bar and a more formal main dining room  There is also a quotdeliquot like outlet that sells ready made foods that are prefect for grab and go diners The hotel itself has a wide assortment of on site services such as a travel agency ATMs giftsundry shop laundry and such  The hotel also has a full business center and can handle most all business needs including printing copying and faxing as well as express packageletter shipping Overall I was impressed with the remodel of the hotel  Its always had an excellent location and in the winter months not having to venture outside into the biting Chicago cold is a huge plus  Rooms are well furnished and superbly quiet for being directly on a busy airport property  The hotel staff are a friendly bunch and are accustomed to the needs of the frequent business traveler and do their best to accommodate you  
P => Service level is not what it shout be form a Hiton hotel Unfriendly person at check in  As Gold member need to directly need ask for getting benefit  Hotel trying to save them  Unbelievable bad breakfast  A small fatty sandwich and a coffee For more they ask  extra  In business package fitness and internet is included but what cost  each extra  They sound proof rooms what is partly true but the Airco is very noise  Menas no quit room available  Overall rating you do not get best price value  
P => A Pleasant Surprise I arrived in Chicago at pm after having missed a connecting flight and desperately needing rest  After opting not to call friends in the Chicago area I quotHotwiredquot a hotel near ORD and was a bit leery at first when I was booked at the airport Hilton  I dont travel for business and normally dont desire to stay at or near airports but I actually was very happy with this property  I did have to change my room though because unlike previous guests I did have a problem with engine noise  I am confused at the people who stated that the windows were soundproof or perhaps the hotel started soundproofing on lower floors and did not get to fl  but from the moment I walked in my room all I heard were plane engines revving up and then roaring down the runway   about every minute and a half  I looked out of my window and found that I was right next to the control tower I couldve thrown a penny without missing and also RIGHT next to a very active runway for both departing and landing flights  Since I didnt know when it would stop due to all the weather delays of the day I ended up asking for a room on the other side which the gentleman at the front desk quickly and very politely gave me  As a matter of fact every employee I came in contact with was pleasant and the check inout kiosks were very handy and quick  In a nutshellI would not recommend this hotel if you are visiting Chicago and plan to spend most of your time downtownI would recommend this hotel if you are doing a quick day trip travelling to the immediate area on business or are stranded at OHare for the evening  Also if you enjoy the idea of being able to get from your room to the terminal in a matter of minutes then this is your property It was clean modern and extremely comfortable  I am usually partial to the Starwood properties but after staying here and at a Doubletree a few days later I am considering switching to the Hilton brands  
P => DAYLIGHT ROBBERY we stayed at the Hilton for the y th weekend Having driven down there we reached chicago around  in the night and didnt want to go through the hassle of parking in the airport parking ramp and chose to opt for the valet parking with the Hilton which is USD  a NIGHTANYWAYS the next night we parked at the airport ramp opp the hotel which charged us about half what Hilton did and informed the front desk that we wouldnt be using their valet services that evening But a week later I see that we have been charged for two nights parking a total of USD  and for the last  days Ive been calling the finnace dept at hilton to sort this issue  The only response I have received is that quotwe are looking into this and will call you back this afternoonquot  Today when I called again the lady at the finance dept says she has no idea regarding my claim and would need to get back to me I told her clearly that Id been spekaing with the fin dept and would be great if she could ask around   Yet to receive any kind of closure on this No wonder the Hiltons get richer They rob you even for services you dont use 
P => Nice Hotel at a very good ratebut watch out for the  extras   I travelled to Chicago during the y th week and received an excellent rate at this Hilton  The beds were very comfortable and the room featured an extra large flatscreen televisiongranite countertopsa deskcoffee makerclock radio and a liquor cabinet that you pay for if you want any drinks Overall the service was excellent from check in to check out But be prepared to travel a long way to get an affordable meal This is an airport and airport hotels overcharge for everything I was preparedfor the most partbecause I read Trip Advisor before going there To get a meal in the airportis almost impossible as there is nothing on this side of securityonce you leave arrivals You cannot get back in and go to the food court There is a Starbucks and a pretzelhot dog stand and thats about it  The subway transit system is excellent and runs  hours a day Blue Line right to the hotel We bought transit passes   for  days and took the subway and buses all over the city It takes  minutes to get downtown from the airport  There was some airplane noise I could hear from within the room early in the morningbut overall not too bad  The hotel charges a dollar for every phone calleven localwhich is a rip off and a slap in the faceespecially since it is a quotHiltonquot which I thought would include some simple little things at least  The guests have use of the pool and jacuzziwhich were both disappointingas the jacuzzi was lukewarmand the pool small The change rooms were not maintained either and not clean  I would stay here again because of the rate and the room itself  
P => Stunningly Expensive Internet I couldnt believe they charged   an hour for access to the internet from my hotel room  I have never seen such an expensive charge  Just the week before I had free internet at the riott Courtyard in Dublin CA and free internet at another motel in Eugene OR  This hotel is very convenient to the airport but otherwise nothing special especially for the over  per night rate  They also do not give guests a newspaper at their door in the morning only the Financial Times at the front desk you can buy a USA Today or a WSJ at the newstand  No newspaper no complimentary continental breakfast brutally expensive internet all for  
P => FILTHY NEVER AGAIN Was bumped   as usual   from a confirmed flight to my home  Pushed into the Hilton at the Chicago Ohare airport  The first room had a plugged toilet   obvious upon entrance  Asked for repair while we went downstairs to eat  Upon return undressed to shower only to find hair all over the tub and left over toiletries still on the tub sides and in the holders  The plugged toilet should have been the clue but I was tired  Demanded a clean room   was put in a smaller room but fairly clean   black hair all over the floors  The house keeping staff who cant speak English must shed like my dog  The front desk did offer a complimentary toothbrush to make up for the filthy room   WOW Thanks   they refused it when we checked in and requested one I have stayed in some cheap motels and even on military establishments as well as camping areas that were more clean than the famed HILTONThe style of the hotel FILTHYThe restaurant was RIDICULOUS PRICED   BEYOND ANY I HAVE EVER SEEN  Two gentlemen bumped also ordered  salads and  beers and the total was   wo the tip  The gracious airlines who OVER SALE AND OVER BOOK causing the problems gave all of us  to eat on  This was   for dinner breakfast and lunch since our plane did not leave until next day at pm  The restaurant charged  for a bowl of ice cream  for a breakfast buffet  for a breakfast of eggs bacon and toast UNITED AIRLINES SCREWED US AGAIN   as they normally do everyone 
P => Great location   too pricey We chose the OHare Hilton because of its location and certainly not because of the price  The hotel itself is okay as far as hotels go nothing special  Better than a budget hotel along the interstate but it is not grand  The room was okay with nice large window  For view of airport even  d rooms top  floors  Pool is okay  Workout room sauna hot tub  Bed was very comfortable and room sizable  After charging a lot they still charge for the little things  Hotel restaurant was nice but nothing special  Pretty much only place you can eat except a small food court in terminal  or  The location was perfect as we had a  am morning flight and it is right across from terminal   Also the tram takes you easily to the other terminals    and  are within walking distance Next time Id take a late flight home instead of staying over and flying out in the morning  Too expensive  
P => Nice hotel Yes it is a pricey place where to crash for the night when your flight is canceled or delayed but you have the convenience to be in the airport and for that you will pay  And the price is worth it when you have to wake up at AM in the morning to make the only flight available back homeOur room was nice  Do not expect a view here   it is either the parking lot or the airport runaways which could be a treat if you travel with kids  The restaurant Andiamo was a bit of a joke   youd think it would be Italian but it was not  Actually the description said it is an Italian fusion restaurant which usually means you take one cuisine and infuse it with flavors from other cuisines  At Andiamo quotfusionquot literally means one dish from Italy one from Asia one from a steakhouse and some dishes quotI think they could be Italiansquot but they really arent  And the place is so loud do not waste your money here or if you do noit have other options do room service  The food  be the same but at least you will not get the noise  
P => good place to stay Proximity to the airport is the hotels main draw and they use it well Hilton has it down to science   checking in and out service food   everything at least here in Chicago was impeccable  They do charge for every little thing you use in the room but hey this is capitalism and the Hiltons are its fervent devotees  All in all Ive stayed in many Hilton hotels and this has probably been the best one  
P => Wonderful Stayed  night for a mtg earlier this week  Hotel has apparently been reated since my last visit Krispy Kreme kiosk in the lobby was gone ha  Rooms have also apparently been re done  Desk is now an L shape amp my room even had a black leather recliner in it very nice for watching the season finale of LOST  Beds just as comfy as I remember  Location cant be beat for those arriving via OHare  Bathroom toiletries are now Crabtree amp Evelyn not the Nutrigena products Hilton hotels have had for years  They have also done away wthe dont steal me hairdryer amp are apparently phasing out the dont steal me hangers as well both good moves in my opinion  
P => Outstanding I needed a place to stay for the night after arriving in Chicago  This hotel was a very good choice  I walked from the gate to reception and was checked in with no wait at all  Had an excellent room overlooking the terminals and enjoyed having something to see  The room was obviously recently redone and was excellent one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in  The convenience of the accesability to the CTA Blue Line was wonderful  The restaurant was very reasonable try the pizza home made right there  A nice leather recliner and large LCD TV along with a work station made the stay even better  I only have one complaint and even though I had an excellent room rate a charge of   a day for internet use is just NOT reasonable  In fact it is rediculous no one charges that much for internet useage  Thank goodness for my iPhone I dont need their service at that rate  The room was totally soundproof you could not tell you were anywhere near an airport I will be back on my next trip  
P => It works for being stranded It is convenient to the airport and thats the reason I stayed  The room was OK  You have to get key to the mini bar from the bell captain which is a pain in the butt if you use their automatic check in and you dont know I didnt  
P => Very Quiet We had to overnight here on our way to the Caribbean Great location right at the airport very quiet rooms  Long walk following the signs if you go out the doors and cross the street it is much shorter Very nice room Crabtree and Evelyn products in the bathroom shampoo conditioner and lotion fluffy towels  Coffee machine with  sets of supplies one af one regular cups coffee mate sugar  They offer a shaving kit with toothpaste brush and shaver for    We did not open the mini fridge  Ate at the Sports Bar regular bar type food busy good waitress expensive  I got a good rate on the room   with their advance purchase deal so I cant complain  The only complaint I had was they charged me   to receive a ups package which I went to their ups store to pick up I have never heard of a hotel charging to receive packages  Other than that no complaints  
P => Very Close to OHare I had the pleasure of staying at the OHare Hilton on Monday il   one night for business  I had a early morning meeting on Tuesday at the airport so this was the perfect location  The hotel is on airport property no need to go outside  Check in Check in was very smooth as a matter of fact I arrived early about  AM quite a bit before normal check in which is usually about PM and was allowed to check in with no problem  Internet Too expensive     a day     Business center overpriced Food Tasty   but pricey  Rooms Room and bath room were clean bed was very comfortable and TVs was great    quot Flat screen  All in all the stay was good and I will use this hotel again when doing business at Chicago OHare Airport and I recommend this hotel to other business travelers  
P => Perfect for business or layover Stayed here  night for business  We had the meeting on site and everything went very smoothly  This is without a doubt the most convenient hotel for people on the go  You dont even have to walk outside to get to the airport  While I would not recommend this place for taking in the city of Chicago it is a perfect hub for business meetings andor layovers  The service was very good rooms clean and comfy everything one can need is at your fingertips including flight status and check in kiosks  They have a trendy high end venue for dinner and drinks at GasLight but if you want low key they have the sports bar also  Breakfast is the same quick grab n go no frills or a nice sit down  My room was on an Honours floor and I had a treadmill in case I wanted to squeeze in a quick workout within the comfort of my room  They also provided a toiletry kit with shaving products toothbrush and toothpaste  The T V  was a large quot LG flatscreen  Shower had good water temp and pressure  Bed was typical Hilton quality and very comfy  I highly recommend this hotel for short business stays or layovers  
P => Lon ghike but worth it It is a long hike underground from OHare but very convenient hotel for meetings  The rooms are large modern and very nicely furnished  The food is great and it is a nice property to stay at and is very consistent  
P => Good airport hotel We had a one night stay here to end our trip in the States it is one of the better hotels we have stayed in and there has been many The room  we had a suite was a very good size and both the room and bathroom were extremely clean The staff were polite friendly and helpful We ate in the sports bar and had ent meal although nothing specialWould stay again on a stopover in Chicago  
P => Very pleasant stay We missed our connection so British Airways put us up at the Hilton overnight  The location is very convenient to the terminals  The lobby is ordinary and you cant get to the front desk without passing the small jewelry counter where the pushy sales clerk tries her pitch on everyone who passes by  We ignored her as it was  pm and we were very tired  Check in was quick and we were settled in our room in no time  The room was much more elegant than we expected and well on par with downtown Chicago hotel rooms of the same star rating  The bathroom was well appointed with good quality toiletries  The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed watching HBO on the TV which we dont subscribe to at home  We ate at the hotel restaurant the next morning and the food was very good with many European selections like hard rolls and cheese and yogurt  It was an exellent buffet and though a little pricey at  we felt it offered good value  The service was attentive  All in all if we have an early morning flight through Chicago I wouldnt hesitate staying here again  
P => Great for connecting passengers or airline staff on stand by We were stucked in O Hare airport for  days after the storms in mid ember trying to get into any flight to Miami for  days running from gate to gate and spending too much time efforts and hassle at the airport Checking in at the Hilton was the only nice and smooth situation during that couple of days  We were offered a great airline staff discounted rate I work for an airline and in less than min we were all settled in our room  Staff at the front desk was excellent Heavenly beds and nice shower thats all you need when staying in a hotel by the airport I highly recomend it to passengers with overnight conections in O Hare 
P => Very convenient Although my husband and I go to Chicago at least once a year we d never before stayed at the Airport Hilton  We arrived on Friday night with tickets to the Cubs game on Saturday  The greatest thing about this hotel is the convenience   minutes after you get off the plane you can be there by following the signs downstairs from baggage claim  Not to mention getting to town is a breeze since the train is right there too  The hotel is nice enough  Our room was nice the bed was comfortable and it was clean  Another plus is the bar is open late so you can get a bite to eat if you get in late  The line for check in was quite long so we used the automated system which worked out just fine for us and was much quicker than waiting in line  We got a good rate through Expedia so overall I thought it was a good choice for us for this quick trip  Usually it s a bit pricey for a hotel so far from downtown but I would recommend it for quick trips and definitely for anyone making an overnight connection through O Hare  
P => Not bad it is a airport hotel  Umm the reason is we stay at this hotel is cancellation of my connection air flight  It was mid of ember and very chilly around pm in Chicago  Airline customer services desk was closed   but some of airline staffs recommended us this hotel with cheap rate  This hotel is located very very near to Chicago airport it is definitely convenient if you have transit flight here  We have dinner at this hotel restaurant but the cost made us very surprised  Two persons dinners were more expensive than room rate      I think they dont provide us free breakfast but please check yourself Oh I just recall my memory that this hotel only provides you one set of grooming kit and it is very expensive of hotel supply    or    We finally got very cheap room rate with airline information  If you have to stay because of airline matter please try this  Chicago is very nice city to visit I dont recommend this for sight seeing persons  
P => Location Location Location        but otherwise mediocre Location is the only reason to book at this hotel  The hotel is located in the middle of Ohare  Strolling from gate to hotel to gate without the hassles of traffic or the blue line is stress free  So close that you can hear the roar of the engines and smell the jet fuel  But hey Now for the rest of the deal     The room was on the small side with a huge flatscreen TV comfortable bed nice bath no robe good desk  My room was drafty and cold even after turning the thermostat up  Not sure where the leak was but I ended up putting on my winter coat as a robe when working at the desk  Amenities come with stiff extra charges from exercise access to internet access  Do not open the toothbrushtoothpast kit unless you want to shell out  or  bucks Check in and check out counter was lightly staffed but the automated system works well  The convenience of doing flight check in and boarding pass at the hotel was nice I bought a  buck day pass and took the blue line into Chicago  Ate at a great Italian place south of the loop instead of dining at the chains in the hotel and aiport  
P => Loved the stay I stayed there after my hectic flight schedule from India to chicago   it was cold and chilly over there   but the moment I entered in hotel It was so cozy  I relly liked the or and hospitality we got a nice room to stay    from which I could see the airport all night   then after a nice long sleep we were offered a nice breakfast   and there was a nice surprise on that particular day we got someone who was there to have a feedback on the breakfast and was also paying  for giving some nice ideas   I surely gave one then was offered a  check   COOL    I am happy for the stay   I cherish those moments 
P => Great location for air travel Right in the heart of the beast we call Ohare is the Hilton  Recently reated rooms good sound proofing and  inch Tvs are great  Walking right to the terminal for an early flight is also a plus  Sports Bar has good sandwich food and drinks  Staff is very efficient and the hotel is a well oiled machine as you would expect with a business hotel  
P => Not a  star   more like   Fist off this is a  star hotel  I dont care what they say  My wife and myself are quoteasy to pleasequot travelers  But we were disappoined with the Hilton mostly because it was rated a  star and our expectations were higher When we arrived we were without luggage another problem unrelated to the Hilton   another passenger mistakingnly took ours instead of their own  Despite the nickel and dime stigma that this place had been given in previous reviews I was sure we could ask for a complimentary toothbrush if nothing else until our luggage would be available  I was told that I could purchase a toothbrush along with a small toothpaste tube and razor for    Believe me people there is NOTHING FREE at this hotel Everywhere you turn they are trying to charge you extra for everything  Things that would not normally bother me began to as a result of the nickel and diming and the inattentive service The rooms were small   The restaurant choices were all expensive  No free shuttles  per person round trip to the nearest restaurant to nearby resatuarants   The gym is nice but costs extra   Water pressure is nonexistent  The whole hotel is showing signs of wear  The front desk acts as if making eye contact with you is just too much effort  I could go on but to be fair here are the positivesFlat screen TV HD TV but no HD channelsLarge thick towelsSuper comfy bedsQuietImmediate access to airport blue line train to downtown Chicago Andiamo Hotel Restaurant had pretty good food but like I said youll pay for it TIP Split your meal at Andiamo  The portions are big enough that youll both be full  There is not charge for splitting and youll cut your bill by half  The waiter even suggested it so it must be common practice  Overall we were unhappy with our stay   but made the most of it  If it were a  star my expectations would have not been as high  Some small improvements could go a long way to help this place We actually ided to stay an extra night in Chicago and I booked a night at the Sofitel a couple of miles away  WAYYYYY BETTERGO TO THE SOFITEL   free shuttle service complimentary water and other nice perks like a flat screen that actually has HD programming bathrobes mp player hookups bigger rooms great customer service etc  A real  star  AND ITS CHEAPERTake this review in stride because your experience and pocketbook  vary  But like I said in the beginning myself and my wife really dont look for things to complain about normally  And unless staying right at the airport is absolutely necessarry there are better choices for the money  
P => Priceline shoppers for Chicago OHare Beware I booked this hotel through priceline quotname your own pricequot and was extremely disappointed  Priceline says this is a four star hotel but it is more like a  star They nickle and dime you for everything  the gym is  extra per day  Parking is   A bottle of water at the gym is   A small bag with a cheap toothbrush and mini toothpaste in your room costs    Internet access is    So by the time you pay for all this stuff your great priceline deal is a huge rip off  The rooms are small and very noisy  The bathroom is so small that you can barely turn around  There is a lot of hallway noise and noise from other rooms yet the airport noise is actually not as bothersome  PROSThey have huge screen TVs in the room which is a plus  The service was actually quite good in this hotel and whenever I requested something someone was at my door within  minutes  Even though the gym cost  per visit it was a good place to work out If you are using priceline quotname your own pricequot BEWARE  You could get stuck with this hotel at the  star level when it is not a  star hotel  
P => Good but with a few issues    Convenient to the airport  Very Very short walk from terminals  Nice rooom refurbished  Nice public spaces  Awesome gym with a big weight area including free weights and machines  Couple of issues  First was the elevators  They have about eight elevators but only three were working when I was there  Long waits which sucked  Another issue was being overcharged for breakfast  There were four of us at breakfast  it was a business meeting where two people ordered the buffet one only had coffee and one had coffee and asked for an english muffin  The person did not get the muffin from the buffet but ordered it off the menu  The bill camae and it was  dollars  The waiter had charged everyone for the buffett even though only two people ate off the buffet  The waiter did not handle the inquiry very well and it is my opinion that he deliberately charged us for four buffets as this was a bsuiness metting and we were all very involved with discussion  I think he thought we wouldnt bat an eye at the bill  Besides this the hotel is OK  
P => always very good I frequently stay here for meetings  It is great to take the short shuttle train after a long transatlantic flight and be in bed within a very short time  I find this well above the average airport hotel with excellent attentive staff very comfortable rooms with everything you could need and a superb comfortable bed  Restaurant is reasonably priced with good food  Best airport hotel I have been in and thoroughly recommended  
P => Excellent Views at the Hilton From the time you enter the Hilton OHare there is a great feeling that you are welcome  There is self check in and ample elevator banks  The hallways are very chilly however the room is just the right size  Great plasma tvs super soft beds excellent views if you stay on a high floor I stayed on the th and especially nice if you stay in an odd numbered room because you have views of both the airplanes landing and taking off as well as the Chicago Skyline  I will forewarn travelers that if you book via Priceline and name your own price where you do not know what hotel you get until after you pay be careful what you wish for because you  get it  I paid night however since I was driving and didnt read an earlier review until now I didnt know that it was day to park  That was not good  We parked at the Blue Line station only a couple of miles away for day and rode the train in Overall the rooms restaurantbar and convienience to the hotel and public transportation cant be beat  Just dont book this hotel if you are driving unless you are ok with day  
P => Always Nice Location cant be beat  If I have a early flight out of ORD I always stay here  The morning I was leaving it was raining outside  It is so great to go to the lowwer level and walk over to the airport without ever going outside Nice view of the airport Staff very nice and helpfull Rooms are a little small but very quiet and nice  Suites are bigger and great for families Inside the rooms you have a small fridge thats loaded with drinks and snacks    beware the prices are very high  Health club is huge and has tons of machines and weights Overall you cant beat this place  
P => Hassle Free for Red Eye Flights Staying here for one night actually a morning was the best ision I made for a non stop red eye flight from San Francisco to Chicago All I did was get my luggage and walk completely within the airport and I arrived at the hotels front desk  I checked in went to my room and flopped Then refreshed after a few hours of sleep and it is very quiet I checked out and took the El train right into the city  So convenient   you will be glad you did this  
P => Comfort at Hilton Front desk staff was pleasant and professional  The room I had one the th floor was extremely nice comfortable and adequate  I spent one night at this property before flying back to Asia  It was very quiet and the room was also very clean  Everything seemed fairly new as though this room had been recently reated  The big screen TV was a nice touch and appreciated by my entire family of four  I only experienced two minor problems and they were not associated with my room  The Starbucks venue was not open for business at  a m  I considered this very strange as most people enjoy coffee during the morning hours  The second problem was finding a working drink machine in the hotel  There were soda machines on floors    There was some sort of problem with all of them  Either the drinks were sold out or there was something wrong with the bill changer  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to book it again in the future  The price I paid by booking through hotels com was  per night  I found the price very reasonable for this property  
P => Flatscreen TV  D I am a semi budget traveller so you know where I am coming from Hotel room sumy quality tv quality toiletries comfy bed    expensive room service   Pretty well maintained hotel  It has an LCD flatscreen TV  D Well   I rarely stay at  star so be thats a norm for that rating    but its my first seeing a flatscreen TV    okok nvm this    Because it is located at the airport park at the Long Term Lot day and take the airport transit to the hotel instead of valet day   The CTA is located right underneath the hotel too so you can take that to downtown    be warned that the travel time will take  hrs roughly   
P => CANT BEAT THE PRICE    My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Ohare Airport from e th to the th on a recent trip to Chicago  We paid  per night through Hotwire and  per night to valet our car  This was a cheap alternative to staying downtown where rooms can range from  to  a night  On the first night we took advantage of our location that was only  minutes away from the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg  We walked around the mall and enjoyed dinner at the Cheesecake Factory  The next morning we drove the  minutes downtown and visited the Shedd Aquarium and the Magnificent Mile  We ate at Bubba Gumps and Lou Malinatis deep dish pizza  Tip we left our car at the aquarium because parking was only   That evening we enjoyed th pool and hot tub at the hotel  The next day we went to the Science and Industry Museum and Millenium park  We ate at Webber Grill which was very good  Overall I would recommend staying at the Hilton Ohare if you dont mind the drive into town  
P => Ok if your are in transit no more no less The Hotel staff and property is excellent the room is above the Hilton standard and if you ask for a view on the Airport its a great bonus for you airplane fanatics The only negative point is the lobby sports bar on the main floor Service is poor food is either to hot or to cold and way to expensive I have had a few drinks in the past stay at this hotel and every time the glasses are not clean or baddly rinsed Other than that its a great hotel if you are in transit in Chicago  
P => VERY Convenient I got an unbeatable rate of  from Priceline  Had an early morning flight out of OHare so stayed here the night before and you just cant beat the convenience  No shuttle bus to catch   just take the elevator down and you are right there between terminals at OHare Comfy bed and probably the softest fluffiest hotel towels Ive had in a long time My biggest complaint VERY expensive internet access  I can understand them wanting to prevent non guests from using it but they should provide a code for guests for discount or free wi fi  
P => Convenience is Not Enough After a long day of flying we were greeted at the front desk with annoyance that we had interrupted the conversation  As the adage says you only get one chance to make a first impression   As we were reluctantly checked in another customer came up and asked about the rate for the evening  When he was told a rack rate  cheaper than our reservation rate I asked if I could have that rate instead    again with reluctance the clerk agreed  GeezIf you are a HHONORS Diamond you get the cold items only on the breakfast buffet and a completely uninspired and loud room  Guess they get so many folks as a captive audience they dont actually have to TRY to please you The ONLY reason I would stay here again is if I were stranded and there were no options off airport  Convenient Sure    but then again so are the dozens of hotels surrounding the airport that have shuttle busses   even though I am a HHONORS Diamond   Never again     
P => An OK Hotel Convenient location directly at the airport Stayed  nights in ch  room was comfy and well furnished but very small and cramped particularly the bathroom which just became annoying  Noise levels are high expensive internet but great views of the airport runways  
P => All around ent Like many others who have stayed here I ended up at this hotel after a cancelled flight  The rooms are very nice clean modern furnishings  Staff is friendly and helpful  The Sports Bar is convenient but the food is not good  The best thing about this hotel is that you can walk without going outside to the United terminal  It was pricey for a Hilton but ok for one night  
P => Cool Airport Hotel  Stayed here because all of the downtown hotels were sold out  Upon arriving I stunned to find out that valet was   I moved my car to a remote lot and paid far less  This hotel is very very convenient if you get stranded   OHare  The Blue Line train takes you downtown which I found nice  I was given a new reated room on the th floor overlooking the runways which I loved  I ate in teh pub one night and had a ent but Hilton expensive Priced meal  I didnt take advantage of the pool because it cost  to use it  The room and hotel overall was very clean  I would definately star here again though  
P => Overpriced but adequate Yes it is overpriced for what youre getting but thats the way it is at a lot of airport hotels  Their rooms are smaller and a bit dated but this is because they want to have as many rooms as possible and because its very difficult to overhaul hotels of this size  Ultimately youre not looking for a resort when youre staying at an airport at least Im not  Youre looking for some place to rest your weary head between long tiring and often irritating flights  Is it kind to your wallet No its not but youll get a good nights sleep and in the end what more can you ask for 
P => If youre tired and stranded and have an expense account    I was flying from the East Coast back to Los Angeles on business when my flight into OHare was delayed several hours by weather which caused me to miss my connecting flight  Tired and frustrated I checked into the OHare Hilton knowing full well what I was getting myself into  Sure enough it was exactly as I expected The good  By far the most redeeming thing about the OHare Hilton is that it is immediately adjacent to Terminals  amp  and accesssible through an underground connection from baggage claim  To not have to leave the airport and catch a shuttle or pay for cab particularly in bad weather and to be able to walk to the airport in the morning without worrying about missing a shuttle is huge  The hotel is one of the most convenient major airport hotels there is here in the US   They are clearly ready for people like me  At  at night the retail store in the lower level was open and stocked with clean pressed clothes in case the hamper that was my rollie bag was full which it was   Better yet they offered an extremely efficient laundry and drycleaning service   I asked that my clothes were ready at  the next morning and at  my doorbell rang   per shirt  I would usually have to go to Japan to get this type of service   My room was nice  Comfortable bed plenty of pillows convenient desk with lots of plugs black granite countertops sufficient bathroom good smelling shampoo and soap  No the room wasnt huge but for a business traveler I had only myself to keep company  The lobby or wont win any awards but I wasnt looking to hand them out either   The staff that I dealt with was friendly and helpful   The hotel knows how to move lots of people in and out quicklyThe bad  When I told a friend my story and mentioned where I had stayed he said quotThe OHare Hilton What did you pay quot I guess that made me feel better that it only cost me  that night  For what its worth another colleague also missed his flight the next day and paid the same  his plane was grounded in Bloomington so he rented a car and drove to OHare with the guy he met in the seat next to him   and I thought I was having a bad day  It made me feel like the entire operation was set up to gouge people during inclement weather  Im sure booking ahead is a far better deal and if I had a little more time Id consider saving the money and going off site for a better room at a lower cost particularly if I was paying the bill which I wasnt   On top of that with a mediocre  burger for room service which took  minutes plus tax and fees my bill was  for one night at an airport hotel   thats enough for me to try to route myself to a safer connecting hub next time  OHare can be the death knell for even the most intrepid of business travelers   I checked in at the kiosk  My business companion couldnt get it to work so he went to the front desk while I forged ahead with the touch screen  It took me several minutes longer than him to get checked in because the kiosk took a while to print out all the documents including a handy coupon for a free water in the refreshment station aka mini bar in my room  Clearly if there were a line however the kiosk is the way to go  Check out was painless   a phone call to the front desk The good news was that I fell asleep as soon as I finished eating and got a good nights sleep and left as quickly as I had arrived and all things considered I would choose the OHare Hilton  times out of  in situations like mine and perhaps even in less pressing situations  While Im basically paying  to save myself a cab ride the Hilton is simply too convenient to overlook  
P => Definitely a  star hotel Had to book a last minute hotel room for a meeting in Chicago so paid more than average   Room is extremely small holes in sheets someones long blond hair on my towels room is dark and not enough lighting and tiny bathroom  Front desk is so so  They expect you to use the self check in kiosk instead of you wasting their time  Im a Hilton Gold member have stayed in many Hiltons across US would not recommend paying more than   for this room  The only pro is that it is conveniently located in the airport  If youre looking for a  star hotel then youve found the one 
P => Hilton OHare Hit the Spot Had a quick overnight to Chicago for a meeting that was booked in a conference room at OHare  Got a great deal on Hotwire less than  so ided to give the Hilton a try I was pleasantly surprised   The convenience factor is tremendous  The hotel is right in Terminal   Easy The staff was very friendly and helpful  A all the way around The room was clean and functional  Flat screen tv was nice  Coffee maker worked  Fitness center was above average  Lots of treadmills and elipticas with built in tvs  The downside No free internet access  I wish hotels would build it into the rate  Paying for Internet is inconvenient and distasteful Another downside Very expensive coffee place in the lobby  Large drip coffee and a piece of lemon bread    Water was more than   And youre kind of stuck with whats avaiable at the hotel I give this hotel a solid quotaveragequot rating  Nothing special   but not too bad  Id definitely stay there again if I had business at the airport  And if I could get a below  rate  
P => Not A Typical Hilton Like earlier reviewers Im Hilton Gold and consider myself loyal to that chain  This hotel however just barely meets Hilton standards  Check in is confusing  Your choices are to use a kiosk    which couldnt find my reservation    or stand in line for an actual desk clerk  Rooms are relatively small and in need of reation  The clock radio didnt work     at least not the radio or iPod connection  The in room Internet connection also failed  Both the wireless and wired connections would acknowledge my log on but then the system froze before I could open the browser  I ended up using a Verizon wireless card for access Room service was prompt and the food was surprisingly good although overpriced The only Hilton ive seen with such low standards was the Hilton at London Gatwick airport which was so bad that I havent stayed there in the past five years  I guess the airport locations dont inspire much incentive to provide typical Hilton rooms and service  
P => What you expect from a Hilton If you are looking for a hotel near OHare this is THE PLACE to go  The hotel is very convienently located on the airport property  Despite the proximity to the runways the rooms are very quiet  The rooms are small but nicely furnished with very comfortable beds  The workdesk area is larger than usual making it much more useful for the business traveler  The room and bathroom were clean and well lit There is no executive floor offered  but high floors are ked as quothilton honorsquot floors  Im not sure if these floors are any different than the others There are no real restaurant options nearby other than those offered within the hotel  The sports bar in the hotel offered average food typical hotel prices with above average staff  Service was very friendly and fast  The same cannot be said for the steak restaurant  The service was slow and the high priced food was below average in quality  Frankly I have had better steaks at Outback As previous reviewers have stated be sure to block out plenty of time if you plan to travel into the city  A ride on the blue line will take you close to an hour and a taxi could take longer during peak traffic hours  
P => Nice but  star Re Only hotel at Airport  This hotel is the last resort for the delay traveller and knows it  Sky high expensive  for a quality inn  and once inside you are trapped  You have no options food either hotel restaurant breakfast at   pretty well minimum  or the mini bar  at minibar prices snickers bar    Room service delays were  minutes once you have held on line for  minutes or so You can order from outside but that is  minutes and I understand that for shopping or anything else if you dont know the transit system you are looking at  by taxi Trapped   The hotel charges   not   as another comment notes for WIFI and you have to pay full regular price  again   to use the fitness centre  There is not even a discount for hotel guests  I suppose that some people use the conference facilities but the business model seems to count on the standed crowd with no choice  Advantages rooms are business hotel standard   a little small by American standards  more like Europe  well kept property clean etc  
P => Nice hotel for business travel The Hilton OHare Airport was one of the nicest Hiltons I have stayed at  The rooms were newly reated mine had a  plasma tv including the bathrooms  It was an average sized room but the bed was comfortable and noise from the airport was minimal  Most rooms offer great views of the airports runwaysterminals  The breakfast buffet is quite expensive and overpriced and not much different from HiltonDoubletree buffets in different cities  Speaking of overpriced all three restaurants sure knew how to charge a lot for their meals but in terms of quality the food was average at best  I would note that the Kobe burger in the sports bar for  was worth the money  In any event I would highly recommend this hotel for any business traveler who wants to stay in a nice Chicago hotel  However if you want to go downtown its going to take a large chunk out of your afternoon or evening due to the distance ORD is from downtown Chicago  
P => Nice but  star We stayed at this Hilton which is right smack dab in the middle of OHare Airport  Not near it but in it  Cross the quotstreetquot and you are inside Terminal   That part was a blast for the kids ages   and   We were not going on a flight or arriving from one either we just wanted a  star hotel in the Woodfield Mall general area and got this from Priceline for under   Thank goodness The service was excellent  Made me feel like I could have one of those people who paid full price We even had to leave our luggage with the bell office because we arrived a bit early and the rooms werent ready  No charge and not a problem that we didnt return from shopping and actually check in until almost  PM  On the other hand what you dont know in advance is that you have to pay  for  hours of valet parking  If you park yourself in the OHare ks it is possibly more expensive  We went in and out about  times during the  hours and the valet was prompt and courteous even though I didnt tip  Looking back on it that was bad but I didnt have tip change in my pocket just bigger bills It was a nice hotel  Really comfy bed has down mattress toppers and the foam optionals in the closet  Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries  Thats about it for the good news  Room cleanliness size modern linens all below  star  The room was one of the smallest I have been in for a chain  And  people cannot occupy the bathroom at the same time  It was almost  an hour for wireless in the room  In this day and age for a  star not to offer that in the room is ridiculous  You dont want the rest of the world to pick up your WiFi hire a better analyst or let them use it work out a deal with the airport something Not more than   stars from me  
P => nice room but watch out for the money traps The hotel is nice classy with comfortable beds and an interesting view  It was very quiet   no loud kids or people partying and a convenient locations WATCHOUT for the extra costs  about  for valet per day and about  per day to park at the parking lot across the street  The items from the refrigerator were overpriced   they charged for a newpaper each day  Internet  per DAY and the workout room has a  fee  TIP park at the rosemont park n ride for   hours and purchase a visitors pass for unlimited train rides around the city  The train from rosemont to the hotel basement is about  minutes and its nice people watching Its a  minute walk from the ohare train station to the hotel  
P => Beware   Unsafe Hotel I stayed here for an overnight stay as I had a connecting flight early the next morning  I chose the hotel because it was very convenient to the airport and I felt that the Hilton was a chain of hotels that I could trust and feel safe in  The room itself was clean  The walls however were paper thin and I could clearly hear the person in the next room talking on her phone all night and noises coming from the hallway  Unfortunately my stay was ruined because I was a victim of theft at the hotel  I contacted the Hilton Corporation and explained the situation as I had clear evidence it was someone in their organization and did not receive a single response back from anyone at the Corporate headquarters  I dont feel that this hotel is a safe place to stay and if you do ever experience a problem dont expect the Hilton Corporation to care  Its not worth the risk to your well being to stay here  I would recommend to forego the convenience and stay at a different hotel that at least cares about the safety of its guests  
P => Great if you need to be near OHare Stayed here in y for some business meetings and had a most pleasant stay  Yes it does cater actually is setup somewhat more for business travelers nd floor is meeting rooms but it is still a very nice hotel and would have no hesitation whatsoever to stay here with family or on any non business itinerary  Check in is very quick even though they were very busy at the time  They typically have enough front desk staff to handle the volume and at one end of the registration desk is a arate place where Hilton HHonors members can check in  The hotel is in great shape especially the rooms  They are clean big enough they have kind of a European look to them have very comfortable beds and are unbelievably quiet given the hotel is on the airport grounds The restaurant and sports bar downstairs are nice enough typical hotel fare and prices but the food was good and wait staff were attentive and timely  The atmosphere is nice and calm   good to get away from the hustlebustle in the lobby  The hotel also has a great fitness center on the lower level with plenty of treadmills bikes weights etc  No wait at all  The pool is right there next to the fitness center as well The location is convenient especially if you have travel issues around getting intoout of OHare e g  early or late flights  You can walk to the hotel from any concourse without going outside and as other reviewers have said there are train and bus stops there in the lower tunnel level so you can get downtown in about  minutes  There is obviously nothing to do outside of the hotel without some form of transportation but if you are looking for a place to stay with the quickest access to OHare this is it You can check in for your flights and print boarding passes from kiosks located in the hotel lobby   that is also nice if you want to save time from waiting in lines once you get back over to the airport All in all would stay here any time   the lone exception being pricing  It can be very expensive sometimes not sure what drives the prices so much higher at times but when the rates are comparable wouldnt hesitate staying here again  
P => Location Location Location Location is what this hotel has going for it  Neslted IN the Chicago Ohare Airport is a huge conveinence for travelers that fly in  The Blue Line train to downtown is located on the lower level  Room was average a little small  Beds were ok  No place within walking distance to eat anything ent   for overnight parking  I loved this hotel for price and conveinence only  
P => Not Worth The Money   but Convenient and Generally Okay This hotel is mainly for business travelers  Its fairly crowded in the lobby restaurants and such  Generally an okay place  Room is clean  Staff is reasonably good but someone cold There is a great workout room but they charge for it unless you are a Hilton Gold Level member Corner rooms are nice because they have large windows on two walls Internet costs day   a rip off  Its quite a trek from the actual Airport Terminal but convenient It has a convenient check in Kiosk to print boarding passes for any airline  Room service is very very expensive and average quality  Better off walking down to the restaurant I asked the staff for a spare ziplock bag and they didnt even check they said quotwe dont have anyquot  That could be true but they could have suggested where to get one or made some effort to look around before responding Business meeting rooms are okay   rectangular in shape However   the Airport itself is a mess  Constant delays  I would not recommend flying into or out of OHare or hosting meetings here  Choose Houston or Dallas instead  Delays and cancellations are common  Sitting on the tarmac for   hours is common  Bad stuff  
P => Plesant Stay Stayed at the Hilton OHare because I had an early A  M  flight the next morning  Check in was smooth the front desk staff was helpful with information about the hotel  The room was clean and up to the above average standards of the Hilton chain  The bed is wonderful and comfortable  There is a refrig with items in there to be paid for if they are comsumed  No microwave there is a small coffee pot for two cups of coffee  The hotel has a business center and on the lower level there is a computer room with  computers and I think  or  printers  The cost is a miminum of   to sign on to the internet  Credit card required  The gym is on the lower level as well the gift shop and another small retail shop  There is a resturant on the check in level of the hotel This hotel is clearly a hotel for Business Travelers although tourist will find it attractive  The convenience to get into the city is a plus for this hotel right in the airport  You can take the Blue Line right in to the city  I purchased a day pass for   for use on the CTA bus and train  BE AWARE there is a lot of construction going on in the downtown area of Chicago  Also the blue line train route is under contstruction  From the hotel you will ride the line to the Western station and then take Shuttle bus to the downtown area  Allow more time to get to and from the downtown area from the hotel  I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Cant Beat the Convenience We stayed here for one night on Saturday e  and it was a great stay  We were driving to Chicago for the day then flying out of OHare the next morning for  days  We were originally booked in the Courtyard near the airport where they had a free parking for up to  days deal  But we changed our reservation to the Hilton for the convenience  We wanted to go downtown for the Taste of Chicago then we had a  am flight the next day  The Hilton is connected to the CTA Blue Line station and OHare airport via tunnels  This was the beginning of our honeymoon so we were willing to pay the extra  room rate and parking for the convenience  We dropped our truck off at Park N Jet on Manheim Road great service by the way and much cheaper than both Hilton and airport parking  Their shuttle brought us to the hotel which is in the airport complex  Once we checked in we didnt have to deal with parking or traffic for the rest of our trip  You can access the CTA trains directly through their underground atrium   minutes later we were enjoying the Taste of Chicago festival downtown  The next morning we used their underground atrium again to get into the airport terminal  You can check in for your flight and print your boarding passes right from a kiosk in their lobby  The convenience alone made it all worth the extra cost  The room was clean and updated and apparently pretty well soundproofed since the noise from the airport didnt bother us  We were not there long enough to eat or enjoy any of the other amenities  This is obviously a hotel geared toward the business traveler  The same room costs three times as much during the week  But we were there on a Saturday and got a pretty good rate  with AAA for a Chicago hotel of this class and convenience  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Not Worth the Price The Hilton is one of those hotels that has the outward appearance of being very well maintained and expensive looking but its really not worth the price My husband and I got a good deal through Priceline and stayed here over Labor Day weekend and we were pretty disappointed Theres no microwave and unbelievably youre actually not allowed to put your own food in the fridge Theres also no continental breakfast or anything like that  Because its in the airport parking is also pretty steep     a night We actually followed the amazing advice of a fellow TripAdvisor reviewer and parked our car at the Rosemont train station and took the train to OHare which takes about  mins  Compared to the Hiltons  a  minute train ride translated to about  for a full day of parking  Best advice we got on that tripOther than that the hotel was beautiful and well maintained  Since its on the train system it was an absolute cinch getting in to the city and I will admit that the Hilton quotDream bedsquot yep they have a name are the best Ive ever slept in hands down  
P => comfortable night before flight home Because of all the congestion at airports early in the morning we ided to stay at OHare the night before our scheduled flight The Hilton was clean and comfortable with littte airport noise  In the morning we boarded the courtesy bus with drop off at our terminal  We arrived in CA  relaxed and rested  
P => Convenient for Airport and Downtown Chicago My wife and I stayed here for two nights at the end of our vacation in  We chose the Hilton partly because most of the hotels in downtown Chicago were fully booked as it was a holiday weekend  We opted for the romance package which includes sparkling wine and chocolates breakfast for one morning we exchanged this for dinner and use of the health club Our accommodation on the top floor had a great view of the aircraft movements  The room itself was stylish with some nice touches including a funky clock radio and a CD player We ate at both Sports Edition a sports themed bar with lots of TVs and Andiamo a restaurant next door  The food and service was excellent and not overly expensive considering the location The hotel is situated via an underground tunnel near to the CTA Blue Line which takes approx  minutes to get to downtown Chicago I would definitely recommend staying at the Hilton Chicago O Hare  
P => Ultra Convenient to OHare  Great Fitness Center Shops  Had a  AM flight out of OHare  Rather than try to make the   hour drive from OakBrook during morning rush hour I opted to pay the extra   which I saved by returning my rental car early and stayed at the OHare Hilton  Check in at  PM was very quick  Room was nice size  Hilton Honors members get two free waters from the mini bar continental breakfast with smoked salmon  amp free use of the fitness center  The fitness center on the lower level was big with many free wieights weight machines and about  each of cross trainers treadmillls bikes and steppers wpersonal TVs  Also a small pool and hot tub  Its used by people who are not staying at the hotel in addition to guests  Bed was very comfy  and room right next to OHare parking garage was very quiet  super soundproofed I guess  Its always nice to get little perks   in the mini bar were  slices of lemon and a small pitcher of cream for coffee  Never seen that before  Preprinted my boarding pass at one of the many kiosks in the lobby Rolled out of bed at  had time for breakfast and at my gate at   Clean and convenient  
P => Convenient Airport Hotel   though expensive Stayed at this hotel during a stopover en route to PHX  Stayed in a standard doudle guestroom  I found the room to be very clean and well presented  A little on the small side with a huge recliner taking up a lot of spaceStaff very attentive and the service very prompt  I requested a crib for our  month old dhter and it was delivered within  mins of check in Breakfast was average fare   for the all you can eat buffett menu Ate at the on site sports bar which was good food but expensive    for a bottle of beer In conclusion good airport hotel with an underground walkway to T amp T  As with convenience you pay top  Would stay here again  
P => Ratty rooms and below Hilton standards I got room  and it was nasty  I am only quot but there was no way I could use the bathrom  I stay over  nights a year in USA hotels  The OHare Hilton is shoddy ratty and run down and when they send the email asking Gold Members to write about their experience the site doesnt work so here I am  The place needs MONEY spending soon  Beware room  on the so called Executive Floor  You will be disappointed and I got stuck there for  nights OY Managers on duty arent Beware this Hilton  Nasty Old ThreadbarePeter NooneHilton Honors Gold   
P => Totally unresponsive staff I stayed here for just one night for business in early ch Check in was a disaster  The kiosk in the lobby would not work so I had to stand in line for  minutes while the completely unresponsive front desk staff just stared at their computer screens and walked around  What a nighte The rooms are halfway ent and apparently soundproofed Overall it was adequate but if you have any problem at all dont expect any assistance from the comatose front desk staff  
P => Extra mile on service Was stranded at OHare due to weather and got the last room available through the airline gate agent  VERY convinient as it is right inside the terminal and you can walk the next morning to your flight  The room is a bit small but the staff was very nice had no change of clothes but when asked at pm if they could wash my clothes they said no problem and had them back to me in  hours and much cheaper than buying a new set Sports bargrill downstairs had ent food and atmosphere and if you can get a entcomparable rate to the other nearby hotels I would recommend highly for the added convinience factor  
P => Better Stay nd time around Loved it nd overnight stay at the Hilton OHare   Check in was a breeze was booked into room  top floor room  High Away from Elevators and Smoking    The Chicago OHare Hilton has always provided my room preferences and their beds are something to die for Ive stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels but this one has the best bedspillows in the world  Dont even think of watching TV in bed you will be asleep in minutes  Despite my past bad review the bed was the same HEAVEN standard Room was very clean past guest had drop a smoke and burnt the carpet for the length of a cigarette but nothing you can expect the Hilton to fix quickly not really a worry Room had its own ADSL modem on the desk standard   fee but as per my last stay had issues with multiple connections  You would get timeouts on pages if you tried to view too many at once  Rather annoying and time consuming if you like loading many pages at once or pages with lots of images Flickr had alot of issues both times This hotel has the best Coffee machine Ive experienced they even give you a take away cup if you want to brew an on the go run checkout As I was looking for a am checkout a window washer came by about am would have been nice if the hotel warned people  Being male I wasnt too concerned but females would think differently  I was taking Airport photos so this was a bonus for me This is the only Hilton Hotel I really look forward to returning to  The beds alone are worth it despite a  hour sleep you wake up feeling like you slept a week refreshed and renewed  
P => Great Hotel Stayed here for a night in order to catch a plane next day  Check in and everything was fine the room was large and comfortable  Great Hotel I always loved Hilton 
P => Clean Your Whirlpool Tub Before Use Mold in the whirlpool tubs in the suite  Had to see a physician for antibiotic pills and cream to treat a severe dermatitis rash all over body  Working with the public I now face a week or so of red blotchyitchy skin and discomfort  Thanks Hilton for an uncomfortable week ahead 
P => A solid hotel for meetings and connections The Hilton OHare is the large semicircular black hotel located between the arrival terminal and the parking garage at Chicago OHare Airport  It has for many years offered unmatched convenience I think it was one of the first hotels build on airport grounds and has maintained a standard for room quality and service that remains first rate  Despite a few issues this is still the choice for business travelers booking connections or airport meetings in Chicago  The hotel is a short walk from the terminal though a connecting tunnel at Terminal   You have to go into the terminal from the train then down an elevator and back the way you came through a tunnel to get to the hotel there is no surface access follow the signs  Once you arrive at the elevators go up to the Lobby to check in there were a number of people confused about that who were milling around the lower levels  Check in and check out are poor so allow extra time  There is a narrow lobby with long lines the length of the glass front too few clerks and a long check in process no better for Hilton Honors at their desk delayed most people up to half an hour getting a room assignment much grumbling in the lines from international travelers trying to get a bed and get to sleep  The restaurant on the same floor is pretty standard a breakfast buffet that is large but expensive and a menu that quickly exceeds the price of the buffet if you go a la carte  The best strategy is to take an included breakfast coupon if you can get it they range from simple continental credit to buffet credit  Otherwise plan on about  per head  The room on the other hand is lovely  The bod and the room are large and include great touches like a senseo style coffee maker with plenty of packets to brew  The bathroom has a lot of high end toiletries and the water is hot and abundant  The in room TV has the usual dizzying array of cable TV and movie channels there is Wireless Internet for  per day add on seems a bit steep and no breaks for Hilton Honors members  There is a shopping arcade and fitness center in the lower level the fitness center was always very busy when I passed by and the patrons are very toned its a place to see and be seen rather than one to exercise in your grubbies  The Chicago quotLquot train has a terminal below the hotel which goes directly into the heart of the city on the Blue Line  Its about a  minute ride each way and costs about  tickets are available at the station  Make sure that you know where you are getting off before you get on there are few maps on the trains themselves see for example httpwww transitchicago commapsmapsD html  The best stop seems to be Clark which lets you out a couple of blocks from the Theater district and the associated restaurants and shopping  Make sure to k your way back too the subway entrance is not well ked and we got lost trying to retrace our steps back  Overall the hotel experience is very upscale in the rooms less so when you hit the lobby and restaurants  Still its convenient and they host a good meeting in the second floor meeting room areas but too few bathrooms   another story    
P => From your room to your gate in minutes The great advantage to this place is its location  Rooms are small but fully equipped  If you have to fly out early this place is ideal  If you want anything resembling a visit to Chicago with its great shopping and great restaurants this isnt it  
P => Nice Hotel Nice hotelPros        Easy to get to from the terminal  Follow the bluewhite quotbedquot signs and then the hilton signs on the floor   Room was clean and quiet   Check in was easy thru the kiosk  Gym is enormous  Full circuit in the machines and a number of aerobic machines   Dining is expensive but more or less tasty Cons       Extra costs Gym is day internet is  or so  Front desk staff is unresponsive  Dont try to open the Le Source shampoo with wet fingers Youll rip your hands 
P => Very nice accomodation Enjoyed one night stay at this very confortable and clean hotel  
P => Made Lemonaid out of a lemon experience When we missed our flight to Amsterdam we were told that United could not book us on a flight until  the following day  It was now  at night Chicago time and we were very upset to be missing out on our planned vacation  The most United would do for us was to give us an  number to call for an accomodation at a discount  We called and chose the Hilton because we could walk to it from Terminal  We walked dejectedly along the vast corridors of OHare sans baggage  Because of TSA restrictions we had no toiletries  We were not happy campers Things started looking up as we approached the Hilton and noticed the gleaming brass and plush carpets  Our   rate was now starting to look like a bargain  The very nice young woman at the front desk checked us in with speed and efficiency  When she heard our tale of woe she whipped out two toothbrushes and toothpaste which complemented the fully stocked toiletries that come with the room  The bellman had lots of maps and brochures to help us spend the next morning touring Chicago  The extremely nice Hungarian woman who owns the boutique fitted us out with sleepware and the wool gloves Id forgotten to pack Upstairs we entered our lovely room which was furnished with two double beds a lounging chair huge desk and automatic coffee maker  The beds and exquisite linens were some of the most comfortable Ive ever slept on  Like others have said all was quiet  My major fear that wed be kept up with airplane noise was unfounded  After a very tasty sandwich in the sports bar downstairs we slept like babies The next day we got up early and headed into Chicago  The train station is located just across the street from the hotel  The young man at the front desk graciously extended the time to check out until  so that we could enjoy Chicago  We paid   each to take the  minute train ride into the city  Since wed never been to Chicago we were thrilled to see it and vowed to return Since we were so close to the airport returning the next afternoon was a breeze  Id definitely stay here again as it was a lovely hotel with great staff  
P => Great Airport Hotel I have no complaints about our one night stay at the OHare HiltonGot a really good deal using Hotwire com for about  per night  Great airport location walk to the terminal Check in desk in the lobby for most major airlines demesticNice on site sports bar Clean large rooms Even though this hotel is on the airport property you cant hear the planes landing ot taking off Some rooms do offer a view of the runways  
P => Obviously its the location Overpriced but beats trying to fight the traffic to catch a morning flight  If we ever have the misfortune of flying out of OHare again we would stay at the Hilton  The bed was very comfortable and the room surprisingly quiet  Ate at the Sports Bar   food was good and service excellent  
P => One of the best airport hotels I see that the reviews for the Airport Hilton at OHare have been mixed but we had a perfect stay all around Check in bellmen service quality of food at room service and at the breakfast buffet were all perfect  It is a beautiful hotel too  The rooms are nicely orated and seem new and fresh This is one of the best airport hotels I have ever stayed at  
P => Very nice hotel and didnt even hear the planes I booked this hotel off of Hotwire  I got it for only  a night  What a deal This was a wonderful hotel The beds were so great The room was very quiet even though it is at the airport  I didnt hear a single plane  Very busy lobby but I would certainly stay there again 
P => Very nice stay at OHare Hilton My three year old son and I just returned from a last minute long weekend in Chicago to see a Cubs game  Im a big fan of commercial aviation and since it was just the two of us I ided to try out the hotel at the airport instead of finding one downtown  I obtained a rate of  per night from Priceline I couldnt have been more pleased with the hotel from check in to check out  First when I asked if I could check my bags somewhere until check in time the desk attendant said hed be happy to let me check in    at am  He asked if I had a room preference and I asked for one with a view of the runways  We ended up with a king room on the top th floor with a fantastic if you like this sort of thing view of the terminals and runways  Very handy for keeping my son occupied  Very little noise from the planes  The front desk also accomodated a late check out with no problems  You can check in for your flights and print your boarding passes from the lobby Room was a good size and nicely orated  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in  Plenty of pillows nice sheets  Very comfortable modern recliner and a good sized L shaped desk  Bathroom was a little small but nice Theres a pool and hot tub in the athletic club attached to the hotel  Other reviewers noted there was a fee but we were not charged to use it  Wireless internet access in the room at   hours VERY close to the train to the city  The hotel is connected to the station    be a two minute walk from the lobby with a three year old  As of ust  its about an hour or so all the way to downtown though there was track construction so the trains had to crawl through certain segments    its probably faster when there is no need to slow down  A little less time to get to Wrigley Field if you get off at the Addison stop and take a bus to the stadium  As another reviewer noted the restaurant choices are limited since most of the food is past security  We picked up some breakfast barsbagels at a Walgreens when we were out the first day and took them back for breakfasts  We were out for lunch and most dinners  There is a small sports bar downstairs that was a little pricey  or  for a burgersandwich but not too bad given that its a hotel restaurant  The kids meal was realtively cheap though  Overall we had a very nice stay and I wouldnt hesitate to return  A cheaper alternative to staying downtown especially with the Priceline rate if you dont mind the train ride  
P => Fine for an overnight at the airport Stayed overnight last week between  flights through OHare  Very convenient location for this   right at the center of the airport and walking distance to terminal  where both my flights were Pleasantly surprised by the calm and clean ambience given the usual busyness of an airport hotel  Very quiet indeed   no intrusive noise from the jets taking off  Room was large with a good work desk plus a good bathroom  Wireless internet access available but lower speed than many other places Kbytes per second max Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was great really nice omelette and reasonably priced  The staff there were really pleasant and helpful Cant think of any negatives   for a short stay at the airport this hit the k  
P => Location location location Amazingly quiet for an airport hotel  Very functional  Banquet food was above average  Call for maid service if you want it done by a specific time  My room was not cleaned until after I called at pm  
P => Pleasant Extended Layover but check your bills I stayed at this hotel because I gave up a seat on United Airlines and they made arrangements for me to stay here  The room was wonderful  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable  Although I was in a room that faced the parking garage I did not notice any additional noise  If you forget your toothbrush or toothpaste they are available for purchase in your mini bar  Internet AccessI paid for daily internet access for   for a  hour period but noticed I was charged twice on my credit card  I would not hold Hilton responsible for this but the third party internet provider  A dispute was filed with my credit card company and resolved Gym Costs  per day has a walk in closet sized indoor pool enough for a the kids to jump in and splash a bit but do not expect to do laps here  Most of the treadmills steppers and eliptical machines are equipped with their own tvradio bring your own headset  There are free weights and other weight lifting equipment  Check in  Check outThe staff at the reservation desk was professional and friendly  I asked about a delayed checkout and was offered a pm checkout instead of a noon check out  Anything later would have been about  extra so I just stored my luggage with the bell desk and showered later in the day the gym  
P => Be careful with the extra charges My husband and I purchased an overnight stay at the Hilton OHare with hotwire for  It was my first time purchasing with hotwire and was skeptical about getting a four star hotel for so little money  We were trying to find something in downtown Chicago but the least expensive was going for night We were driving to Chicago so I called the hotel for directions and found out they charge night for parking That was SO ridiculous a cost that my husband and I parked at the Rosemont quotparkampridequot for night It was great   we bought a two day pass from CTA for pass and took the train to the hotelairport which was the very next stop  The only thing that bothered me were the extra charges the Hilton puts on little incidentals that are complimentary at amp star hotels  For example we forgot toothpaste normally the front desk at a days inn or courtyard riott will bring us a complimentary travel size tube but the Hilton charges   for a travel kit which includes a toothbrush razor toothpasteetc  We had a case of the late nite munchies after returning from a show downtown so we ordered a turkey BLT from room service for  the Hilton then added a   gratuity to our bill in addition to a  charge for in room service It was ridiculous They charge for any little thing they can even when their average rate is over  
P => Pleasant Surprise My partner and I frequently stay in Chicago for weekends but never considered staying at the OHare Hilton until it was booked for us on Hotwire  What a nice surprise Very pleasant facililty easy check in with a helpful and courteous staff beautiful room with one of the best hotel beds we have slept in  Airport noise was NOT an issue   we had an excellent nights sleep  The view of the airports terminals and runways is actually very interesting The only negatives we could find were that food trays from the previous days room service were still in the hallway at noon the following day  In a hotel this nice that was uncalled for  The other issue is parking which is VERY expensive  We suggest using airport remote parking accessed off Besie Coleman Drive then use the airport terminal shuttle train to drop you at terminal   then walk to the lobby follow the signs up the escalator across the walkway bridge down the escalator into the terminal down the elevator  floors and through the pedestrian tunnel  Parking is  as compared to  in the garage  It takes more time but is not hard to do if you are not in a hurry  
P => Nice but a RIP OFF on the extras charges  This is a nice clean comfortable Hilton  Everyone was pleasant and professional and I the room was classic Hilton comfort  I attended a business meeting for three days and spent a Wed Thur Friday at this Hilton  I have two real problems with this hotel   It is a rip off  There standard rooms are twice as much as similar hotels in the area  and  They over charge you for absolutely everything  I would not have been so disgusted by the overpriced room if it werent for the nit picking extras added to the bill    such as     a day to park  a day to use my computer in my room   a day to use the work out center  for an draft beer in the lounge    This i s a shame because it taints an otherwise very pleasant stay in very nice hotel  I just wont go back  
P => Convenient For Business   Not For Leisure This is your best choice of hotel if you are traveling on business  Should you be traveling as a tourist or for pleasure note parking is  daily self park and  valet no exceptions  They will also charge you for all of the amenities to include an extra packet of coffee one pot for your entire stay amenities etc   again if youre going on business I would recommend this hotel otherwise based from experience you can find a better or similar quality hotel near the airport without the hassle of parking at the airport and paying the extra cost  
P => Business Traveler Our company visits the O Hare Hilton at least once or twice a year to hold our national sales meetings  Last visit was      Overall the stay was pretty good  Guaranteed our work will hold a meeting at this hotel again  Mainly because it s at a major airline hub and everyone from the East and West coasts can meet halfway have the meeting and fly right out without having to rent any cars  Very convenient as I mentioned before  My review is from a business traveler s viewpoint as followsCONVENIENCE Key to the popularity of this hotel as it is located right at the O hare airport  Very accessible  Loved that we did not have to catch a cab CHECK INOUT Very fast and easy  They have kiosks situated in different areas of the lobby for easy check in amp out  Much better than standing in line waiting for a desk clerk to help you  Just use the kiosks and you can forego the waiting  You also access flight information for different airlines and check in to your airline and print your boarding pass at the kiosks  Very convenient when we could access this during our meeting breaks print our boarding pass and zip right to the airport terminal when the meeting was done  SLEEPING ROOMS My room was located on the th floor of the east wing  I had a corner room where I had   views of the airport  Wireless is available in the rooms but you have to pay a small   fee per day to access  The bathroom is small but I did not expect a big lavish bathroom  Great water pressure and the small amenities were nice  My bed was VERY comfortable with plush down pillows  I had great night s sleep  Although my room was facing the main airport I could see airplanes take off but I did not hear one plane  The sound proofing facing the runway is incredible  HOWEVER the sound proofing for my room wall next to the adjoining room needed some improvement  My neighbor next door was a little loud  I could hear his whole conversation on his phone his t v  and his alarm clock when it went off at  in the morning MEETING ROOMS The meeting rooms located on the mezzanine are the prime locations  We were in DublinLondon  The sales staff is excellent at answering any needs  The last day of our meeting was moved downstairs to International East  It was great until the end of the day when we were still having training but our room was located next to the crew kitchen so come pm the clean up crew was clattering their dishes away while we were trying to get trained  The meeting rooms downstairs is also where the main traffic is and the arcade amp stores so it gets pretty noisy with all the foot traffic and people coming amp going from the terminal  We could hear the person vacuuming the lobby halls too  Try to get your meeting space planned on the mezzanine FOOD The food was average at best  We came off a meeting at DFW in ch and the food at the Hyatt Regency DFW is fabulous compared to the food at the O Hare  The sales office needs to work on their foodbeverage menu for the meetings  We ve definitely had better fare at other venues Overall this hotel is ideal for business traveler s  Again convenience is key  
P => Very Convenient To Airport We stayed at this hotel paid for by United Airlines on a layover back home to Portland ME  We werent in a good mood when we checked in since we wanted to get home but finally relaxed when we got into the room  The lady at the front counter was very polite the rooms were adequately furnished and clean  This hotel is definately very convenient to OHare as it is the only hotel on the property  We stayed on the back side of the hotel and did not hear any airplane traffic noise at all  The beds were very comfortable as well  We did have dinner at Andiamo near the lobby that night and were pleasantly surprised  The food was very good and I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are staying there for dinner  All in all convenient clean hotel right at the airport  All you have to do is walk to or from your gate and you are there 
P => Very nice beds I was at the Ohare Hilton  times last month  First time was in an upgraded room and it was VERY nice  Second time I was stuck in a room that hadnt been upgraded and it wasnt as nice  BUT both times the beds were fabulous so soft and comfortable Cant beat that Its location next to the airport makes it a winner 
P => position    minutes from plane to room  Hilton Hotel   Chicago O Hare USASituated next to airport with easy access through terminal or a short walk across the road  All the modern faculties you expect for a Hilton  Plus good bar and restaurant where one can relax and have a beer or two before catching your next flight  Booked as a day room am to pm USPROS Convenient position next to airport  Excellent bar and restaurants  Hairdresser massages tanning mini bar air conditioning tea and coffee facilities high speed internet guest service hotline CONS No swimming pool  Recommendation Absolutely for travellers and business purposes  
P => Hard to imagine a better airport sleeping factory The key to a successful stay near a major urban airport is to keep your expectations low and your tolerance for mediocrity high  I stayed at the ORD Hilton for one night in late ust  and thought the place was a reasonably good option in the charmless ORD area  I got the room on Priceline when I bid  per night for a four star hotel near OHare  With taxes and fees the total came to  per night which is very reasonable for a Hilton As mentioned many times below the hotel is an integral part of the central airport core  Because I carried all my luggage aboard the plane I was able to walk directly from the arrival gate to the Hilton  I timed the walk  minutes  seconds  How can you beat that Check in was reasonably easy  Although there were automatic check in machines I ignored them  Two people who arrived in line after me tried them  Both experienced some malfunction and ended back in line  On check in I left an envelope at the desk  My plan was that a colleague arriving on a later flight would claim it  However my desk clerk apparently had no idea where the envelope was supposed to go  When my colleague showed up to claim the envelope another clerk was flummoxed by the request  She ended up calling my room awakening me from a sound sleep to ask whom Id given the envelope to  Fortunately I had remembered the first clerks name and it all turned out well  My room was quite comfortable and very clean  I had a good sleep  Because I used the room solely for sleeping and for its bathroom I cant comment on any other hotel amenities  One thing that impressed me was how quiet the room seemed  Despite the fact it was as close to an airport as any I have ever slept in jet noises were virtually inaudible  I was truly astonished at this but I think I figured out how they did it  In addition to the likely addition of soundproofing materials to the exterior walls and the use of sound barrier windows the hotels heatingventilation system introduces forced air to the room through a duct located to one side of the window  I have never seen an air duct just there before  I think the air delivery system is calibrated to make a dull white noise sound that is at or about the pitch of a jet engine  In effect the background drone from the ventilation system seems to mask or mitigate the noises of an airport  However they did it they succeeded  The hotel is quiet and comfortable  While it is no Shangri la its location cant be beat for an airport hotel  Combine that with a Priceline value and you have a winner  
P => how could you beat it Come on people   this isnt just an airport hotel   its a hotel ATTACHED TO the airport  Its all about locationPriceline put me here at   That friends was a great deal  Got a room with views of the planes yet rekably the room was quiet  The grand entrance to the hotel is interesting   lots of little frilly overpriced stores etc  But a nice travelers store as well  Room was nothing fancy and rather small but was modern clean and had all anyone could want for one night at the airport My advice if you get a good deal here stop looking  This is your airport hotel  It puts you  minutes from your plane  
P => Exceptional hotel Highly recommended We stayed at the Hilton OHare for  nights and had a great stay The rooms were immaculate and included flat screen tvs a mini bar and a bed that was more comforable than the one I have at home The staff was very helpful and friendly  You can walk down a couple of hallways and be at the airport and the quotLquot train station  Very convenient We will definitely go back 
P => Modern Clean Comfortable and Convenient   loved it Stayed here  nights e     We had worried that we would find an older run down Hilton like some other large Hiltons we have stayed at in large cities   e g  New York We were pleasantly surprised  Obviously the hotel has been reated recently  Our room was clean bright free from scuffs and scrapes bathroom was glelaming  The quot flat screen tv was a nice touch Beds were not quite as comfortable as Sheraton quotheavenly bedsquot but were still pretty nice The furnishings orations and lighting were modern and attractive  Convenience to the airport cannot be beat of course  You can grab the El subway into Chicago from the terminal across the street The room was well worth the  per night we paid via one of those quotblindquot web sites  We could have ended up at the Westin Rosemont which the booking site also classified as a  star  Were glad we did not the Westin is in dire need of a major reation and is nowhere as nice or as convenient as the Hilton OHare  See my review of the Westin Rosemont for details and pictures of that worn and tired hotelShop around for a deal and stay at the OHare Hilton if you want a really good airport hotel 
P => Convenient with newly reated rooms If you need to stay atnear OHare this is the most convenient option  The hotel is undergoing reation at the moment  Be sure to ask for a reated room when making a reservation  The reated rooms have very comfortable beds with nice down pillows  The restaurant options in the hotel are not very good but a short cabride away   miles in Rosemont is an Italian restaurant called Carlucci    worth going there if you want a nice dinner in the airport area  For an extra night the hotel will put a treadmill in your room    nicer than going down to the gym if you are a late arrivalearly riser  
P => FINE BUT WATCH THE RATES Following a flight cancellation and need to stay overnight I approached the front desk for a rate for the night  n  I then received a rate from Hotwire which I believed  be this hotel from the description of   plus tax  Guess what  it was  Im glad I got a second opinion  
P => Must pay for poolspa privelages Just a word of warning you must pay for use of their pool   per family  Considering we payed approximately  for one night I expected we would have free use of the pool  Otherwise the hotel was just quotokayquot for us  
P => Great deal makes this a great hotel in a great location In anticipation of needing to overnight in the vicinity of OHare Airport I obtained the Hilton Chicago OHare Airport at a rate of   per night plus taxes by bidding for a   property on Hotwire  On arrival no mention was made of our highly discounted rate and we were assigned a fantastic corner room on a high floor overlooking OHares runways  We were mesmerized by the view and spent a couple of hours watching the airport action from the windows which surrounded two sides of our room As for the room itself it was perfectly functional furnished in a sort of Hilton modern motif with a queen sized bed desk and chair occasional chair and table and night tables  Lamps lighting television and phones all functioned perfectly  Bathroom was also very nice and contained great toiletries This hotel is perfectly located for a layover at OHare  We arrived and departed from Terminal  just a short five  or six minute walk well signposted via underground tunnels  We had dinner at the hotels Italian restaurant Andiamo which we found to be quite good and well priced  Two salads entrees and three glasses of wine between the two of us for about   including tax and tip  Overall we were thrilled with our experience at the Hilton Chicago OHare Airport  Believe me weve experienced plenty of places not nearly up to this hotels standards at three or four times the rate we paid here  Very highly recommended  Well be back the next time we need to overnight at OHare  
P => Great hotel  
P => Another soulless Hilton  
P => Mixed feelings     
P => Loved the Hilton at OHare  
P => What a Painful Experience  
P => A great steaming mess   
P => Wonderfully convenient  
P =>   
P => Correcto pero sin sentirte en un Hilton  
P => Ideal f r fr he Fl ge von OHare  
P =>   
P =>  
P =>   
P =>   
P => Hilton O Hare als  bernachtung vorm Flug ausgezeichnet  
P => 
P => GOOD PLACE It is a very comfortable hotel to enjoy your trips in a very good location 
P => Good Value for Location Hotel is just steps away from the Red Line quotLquot so you can get around easily if you dont want to walk drive or cab it Very clean hotel good water pressure friendly amp accommodating staff nice bed amp pillows but the top sheet and pillow cases felt like theyd been starched temp  in room perfect amp can be adjusted  Didnt try Weber Grill but it looked inviting for a drink and a quick meal  computers are on th floor need room key to access the room so you can check email ampor print out your boarding passes Hotel is near a lot of great shopping Pops for Champagne is around the corner amp only wish we had gone there  ys Cafe is good for breakfast amp is abt   blocks away If we can get as good a rate as we did this time Im pretty sure well stay here again when we visit Chicago  
P => Great Deal for Downtown Chicago I live in the area and stayed downtown for business  This hotel had updated rooms very comfy beds reasonable sized bathrooms and very good service  I am sensitive to odors like reze covering up bad smells  Hilton Garden Inn smelled fresh and clean and had comfortable rooms  You can hear ambulancepolice car sounds at night which is typical of all Chicago area hoteld  Staff seemed friendly  I felt safe and Weber Grill reataurant on site is a great place to eat  No probablem getting a cab in the morning when it was raining  I would recommend and stay again  Most downtown hotels have smaller rooms especially in older hotels  This location is very good for visitors  Tons of places to eat within walking distance  
P => Awesome amenities great location affordable prices This hotel was perfect and I wouldnt have changed a single thing about my two night stay  The rooms and common spaces were impecably clean and cozy  Although a little small the indoor pool and hot tub were both wonderful along with the well appointed fitness room and computer lab with complimentary high speed internet  I loved the microwave and mini fridge in the room along with the Neutrogena toiletries  The king size bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in  Be sure to stop by the lobby around pmpm every night for complimentary warm just baked cookies  The hotel could do well with a dedicated concierge in the lobby to help travelers find their way around the city in order to keep the lines down at the front desk  
P => Excellent hotel in prime location This is an excellent hotel in every way but be careful if you are there Q as there is major construction going on outside the hotel on one side and the jackhammers started up on cue at am every morning  Really fun restaurant Weber Grill and right on the Red Line of the subway system  Walkable to Michigan Avenue shall Fields theatre district  Coffee maker also stocked with tea which I am finding more and more rare these days  Couldnt fault it 
P => Enjoyed the stay The Hilton Garden Inn was a great location for us it is very close to the red line if you would prefer not to take a taxi from the airports  We walked everywhere from our hotel and enjoyed its easy access The staff we encountered were very nice and helpful with any of our questions or needs  The room we stayed in was very clean and comfortable  You can hear some street noise but it is in the city so it was very much expected and did not affect our stay at all We also ate at the restaurant Weber Grill and it was great  Although it was a busy night the waiter was very friendly and attentive  The pretzel rolls were very good and the ribs were excellent  Would stay here again  
P => Outstanding value and location Its hard to find a ent hotel in downtown Chicago at a ent price during the week  I booked my room a few months in advance and found a great  rate  Everything about this HGI was great from the speedy check in to the clean rooms to the location nothing could be better  Whats really great is this hotel is literally steps from the Red Line stop at Grand  You walk up the stairs and the hotel is about  steps away which is very convenient if youre coming in on the train  For those that need any grocery items  there is a grocery store right around the corner where you can find items like soda without paying high hotel prices  I had a great view on the st floor and although this is just a standard HGI the room was very clean and had a nice flat screen TV inside the room  I ate at the hotel restaurant Weber Grill one night and it was great  Overall a typical HGI experience but for the price you cant beat it for the convenience location and price 
P => Nice rooms but terrible organizationstaff  Booked room with  beds directly through hotel on the phone  Was going for a bachelor party and staying with  guys so definately needed  beds  When arrived at hotel they said they only had me booked for  bed  I showed them my confirmation email on my phone and they didnt care  Gave me bed with one room and only got  off and room was  per night  I was able to swich to double bed next day but what a hassle  Also the elevator broke and had to wait  min for the freight elevator The rooms themselves were nice and good location only a couple minute walk from magic mile  
P => Needs a reation The streets are under reation but the hotel isnt    and it needs a good one  Towels are worn out and have holes there isnt a shower cup in the bathroom the shower courtain is quite old the reception has two sofas and a couple of armchairs but no bar  The hotel has a very smal pool and a very small fitness room  Is not worth the price they charge you  You have better options in Chicago  
P => Great hotel with an ever better location After much research we chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn because of the great rate and location  The location could not have been any better  We got off the Red Line of the quotLquot walked up the steps and were right outside the lobby of the hotel  Rode the subway and buses everywhere we went if we didnt walk from the hotels central location  Also there is a free trolley tofrom Navy Pier that stops directly in front of the hotel  If it is too full just grab a city bus   that will also take you to Navy Pier The front desk was very friendly professional and helpful  Since we arrived around noon our room was not ready for check in so we left our luggage with the bellhop and were on our way to explore Chicago  When we came back our room was ready and we retrieved our luggage The hotel was very clean well appointed and everything seemed to be in working order  I was bit concerned about noise based on other reviews but we had absolutely no problems except the occasional siren outside but that will happen with any hotel in downtown Chicago The pool area was nice but small  We did enjoy the hot tub one night after a long day of walking We will definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to this great city  
P => Noisy Buy Nice I have stayed here several times and this hotel is nice and in a great location with a great restaurant attached  However I have noticed as the rates have dropped at this HGI due to the economic downturn I suppose you get the quotin town to partyquot crowd and they are noisy coming and going all hours of the nights  If this wasnt enough noise we were on the nd floor and you could hear people in the street wooping it up until the wee hours  There were many many sirens and you could hear traffic noise especially motorcycles  This is a very noisy hotel  
P => Great location for downtown stay We stayed at this hotel during our stay in y  The location couldnt have been better  The hotel was only two blocks off Michigan Ave  There were a ton of restaurants within a three block area so that was easy  The red line was literally right by the front door the free Navy Pier trolley ran right by the hotel and most of the buses that you need for tourist items were only two blocks away  The staff was very friendly and the hotel was very clean  There is a parking garage next door where you can self park and save yourself some money  The pool was small but the temperature was perfect  The workout room had a lot to offer  We would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a downtown stay and would stay here again  
P => EXcellent Location This hotel is perfect location  Only a block or so from Magnificent Mile  Michigan Ave  Train Subway is right in front of the hoteltook trains to Wrigley Field Cellular Field and to the theater district to see Jersey Boyzz    Parking is a little expensive  per day with in and out priviliges but you are in the city and not much of a choice  The on soite restaurant Weber Grill has good food  plus you are surrounded by great restaurants and shopping all around   Indoor pool made my little one happy  although the ventilation is horrible in the pool area the chlorine smell and lack of cool air was made it difficult to stay long in the pool area for us   The rooms are modern clean so no complaints there  If we were to return to this part of Chicago I would stay here again and have no problem recommending it to others   
P => Would definitely stay here again We Pricelined this hotel for a short getaway to meet friends in Chicago    Paid more than we wanted to but still a great deal Really great location    a few short blocks from Michigan Ave  The corner room was lovely with a view of an outdoor rooftop landscaped track next door  The room was a little cramped with two queen beds rather than one king but had everything you could want  The built in cabinet with microwave counter wcoffee pot amp fridge was SO pretty   I want one in my house The beds were SO comfy except I found myself sticking to the sheets due to the thick pillowtop underneath  Overall a great place for a great getaway in Chi town 
P => My first choice in Chicago This was our third time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn  We reserved the room through Priceline spending only  per night  TIP The quottwo Queen bedquot rooms are much larger than the King rooms  THE PROSThe bedding is updated there is a microwave coffee maker mini fridge and flat screen TV  We LOVED the Jewel grocery store just steps from the hotel  It stays open until midnight too and sells beer wine and liquor along with the usual grocery store items  In my home state you have to go to a special store to by alcoholic beverages  The entrance to the Red Line train is just outside the hotel door and Michigan Ave is just three blocks away  The location is greatFree in room internet service   and it actually worked well THE CONSThere is no High Def service to the TV though so everything on the TV looks stretched out  No big deal The lobby is very bland and small   but who really cares about thatWe didnt use the pool hot tub or exercise room We MUCH prefer the Hilton Garden Inn to the nearby riott  We take about four trips to Chicago each year and have stayed at several different places but the Hilton Garden Inn remains our favorite  
P => Good Time had by Me I stayed for one week while attending a business conference  Within easy walking distance to Navy Pier Art Institute theater district etc  Grocery store and Starbucks both across the street  Clean comfortable and quiet room  Only downside    for an in room movie was steep and a small selection of titles  
P => Everything You Could Want I recently spent a week at this location for business  As I traveled around Chicago during the week and visited friends at other hotels I confirmed again and again that the Hilton Garden Inn is the best kept secret in Chicago  Being in the River North area is perfection  The train is steps away from the front door there is a grocery across the street with a surprisingly good natural food section on two aisles   dont be put off by all the processed k you see as you enter the crowded space a Trader Joes two blocks away Nordstrom across the street in a mall that fronts Michigan Ave for easy bus access and restaurants everywhere you looked  My husband was thrilled that the Chicago Jazz t was a block away as well as an exceptional used bookstore  Spend too much and need to mail things home There is a post office across the street from the grocery store  It just doesnt get better than this for location  Regarding the room it was spacious perfectly appointed had a great city view and was spotless day after day  My only small complaint was the bathtub was tiny and not the kind you can lean back in   too concave    so I relaxed in the hot tub near the pool each day  I also loved the business center with three computers printers fax machine and copy machine  Wonderful Regarding noise the whole city is noisy  Thats Chicago  The hotel restaurant Weber Grill attracts a lot of lively traffic but so does every other restaurant in the area  The weekend crowd was noticeably rowdier than the weekday crowd  This is not a sedate hotel for retirees if you know what I mean  Ask for a room on the upper floors and dont hesitate to call the staff if you need assistance  They were great  
P => Thank you Hilton magnificent mile We actually made a pitch to the Oprah show and met first in one of the convention rooms here  The wait staff did not know who we were but they were so professional and excellent to our business party  We were given the attention the HIlton is famous for and the chef was excellent  Front desk politely and proficiently dealt with our particular concerns  We had international investors and when a bi lingual computer IT professional was needed Hilton staff was very polite and assisted us  
P => Good value for your money I got a pretty good deal on the hotel so overall I was pleased considering I didnt pay a lot Good location   just off Michigan Ave and close to many bars and restaurants  The Grand subway stop is located right in front of the hotel which is an added plus if youre tofrom the airport via the train Hotel staff was friendly Rooms were clean If youre planning to take a late night dip in the pool I e  in the last hour before the pool closes just a warning that this seems to be the time that many families take their kids swimming be to tire them out  The hot tub just isnt quite as relaxing with a bunch of  year olds splashing around beside you    
P => Another great Hilton Great location to go to city attractions  Great staff and clean rooms at a great price 
P => Great location great hotel Very conveniently located  Across the street from the subway and just a couple of blocks to Michigan Ave  and buses  Nordstroms and Bloomies nearby along with all kinds of great restaurants  Room was large and very clean  Had a corner room with lots of light  Staff helpful  Booked on Hotwire for  a night so was delighted to find such a great hotel  
P => Next to perfect  Plusses outweigh the minuses by far  On the plus side immediately on the red line  Could not possibly be more convenient to public transit  Literally steps away   but you  not even need the subway as the hotel is perfectly central amp within easy walking distance of everything downtown  very fluffy bed in contemporary and meticulously clean room attentive and cheerful check in staff went extra mile for us in several respects taxi stand one block away for easy trips to airport or wherever else you  be headed  Minuses  Breakfast at Weber Grill is mediocre at best  Youre better off walking a block or two to any of the surrounding restaurants  Gospel brunch at House of Blues for example  pool is small  But why swim Youre in Chicago   elevator wait times can be a little frustrating   building could use one more elevator    a little pricey I guess  Hard to say  Long story short a lovely stay at a lovely hotel  I wont hesitate to stay here again  
P => Great location mediocre amenities Stayed overnight here with husband and son  Its a great location in terms of being near shopping and bars and restaurants  The rooms were okay but the walls are very thin  You can hear everything  Its nothing special and there are much better hotels very nearby including Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites  
P => First Choice when in Chicago Whenever Im in Chicago I try the Hilton Garden Inn first  Best Location for the quotLquot the superket and Portillos Rooms are spacious and staff is great 
P => clean convenient and comfortable in Chicago Stayed here for  nights at end of ch  Had a price of  a night for the family  Found maid service to be great  even picked up some of my kids toysstuffed animals they had laid around  Bought an all day bustrain pass at Jewel Osco across the street and very easy to get around  Also join your local science museum at home and it got us free reciprical access to Museum of Science and Industry Field Museum Alder planetarium and children museum at Navy Pier Pros  Super location  within walking distance to Mich  avenue El train line right at corner bus stop close grocery store and many restaurantsshopping within one or two blocks  Valet parking was high like most hotels in area but self parking no in or out was  a day which is cheaper than other hotels nearby  Microwave and refrig in room  Neutragena toiletries  Flat screen tv  Small but adequate pool and hot tub  Business center had free internet access which came in handy Cons  Suzette at the front desk wasnt the most informative or friendly but she wasnt there everyday either thankfully and  out of  elevators were broken on the Sunday morning we tried to check out  more than  minutes just trying to leave the building but maid was nice enough to let us on the working freight elevator  
P => Overall great place My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon   mostly to catch some Cubs games  We mostly chose this hotel for its proximity to the Red Line   it is directly outside the front doors  We had a very friendly check in and our room was very clean and spacious  The bathroom had great toiletries and the beds were very comfortable  The pool was small but clean and included a hot tub  The business center had free internet and the valet guys outside were always VERY friendly and helpful  One of them even walked in the pouring rain for  minutes to get us a cabA couple suggestions though if street noise might bother you request a room on a higher floor  There is no continental breakfast but there is a JewelOsco right across the street great because you have an in room fridge  Parking is also steep   day  
P => Great Location and Good Value We just returned from a few nights at the Hilton Garden Inn  Its pluses Its right on the Red Line which makes getting around super easy  The pool though small is located on the th floor and has a great view of the city  The room was clean had a fridge and a microwave  I recommend the JewelOsco mini t across the street on State Street for nibbles or morning bakery Minuses The room by the elevator and ice machine was very noisy and theres all the big city siren noise  Ask for a room further down the hall to eliminate that  
P => Not a bad hotel but noisy We booked this hotel through Priceline and got a good price for  nights Here are the Pros Nice small pool and whirlpool Clean rooms Friendly staff Business Center Great downtown location right off the redline subwayCons No extra perks like free breakfast Rooms are a bit smaller The major drawback is the sound noise  The hotel hallways and room doors are not insulated at all so you can hear everything from outside your room and noise that travels from one room to the next via the hall  That was the worst part of our stay  If the noise issue was resolved somehow it would have been much better  
P => Great location clean and stylish rooms free Wi Fi I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn recently with some extended family for a weekend in Chicago  I will definitely be back  The rooms are a great value and the Free wireless internet is great  The rooms are nicely appointed for a midrange chain with updated furniture Aeron desk chairs comfortable beds with clean white duvet covers and flat screen TVs  see my photographs They have an extended cable line up including HGTV  There is a microwave and refrigerator not a mini bar in each room  it is right across the street from a grocery store  No safe provided  Wi Fi is free and works well  The pool is small and there is a whirlpool  The fitness center contains a few basic machines there was a sign on the door saying free guest passes were available to Crunch fitness a block away  There is a parking garage right next to the hotel   self parking was about  per day   a bargain for downtown Chicago  The hotel is right in the River North district two blocks off Michigan Avenue  Close to River North restaurants and nightlight  Near Nordstroms for shopping  Weber Grill restaurant is just off the lobby  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Great location beautiful hotel and rooms great value in winter We enjoyed this hotel this winter  The location is magnificent  blocks from the Michigan Ave  less than  meters to the Red Line MTA train that takes you virtually everywhere  Nice view floor   The pool is very good and also the business center complimentary use of PC and printer  Within the hotel there is free wifi  
P => Average HGI in a Great Location Lets start with the new HGI mattress which is foam offers little bounce and is overall very stiff and partially contouring  It was right up my alley and one of the more comfortable beds in the Hilton chain but if youre a soft bed sleeper youre going to have real problems with the standard issue mattress at this and every other HGI The room is clean and quality  The noon checkout time is a significant perk for those of us who are not early risers The front desk will tell you the breakfast ends at  when it actually ends at   Not something you want to find out at  a m Not a big fan of the Weber Grill restaurant personally but you could do worse for dinner on a bad weatherlate night Great location helpful polite front desk staff While the room walls are soundproof the pass through and external doors are not Aside from a non functioning smoke alarm somewhat disturbing to have it hanging off the wall this is an average HGI that isnt overpriced with a great location and nice views One other important note  The room is very very dry  If you stay at this hotel and require a somewhat humid room for either health reasons or a cold Id recommend a humidifier  
P => Location and Efficiency I booked the hotel in Hotwire after seen that I could get a room for  a night  I had a reservation at one of the riots and ided to save the  difference per night I have been to Chicago several times and I have stayed in different hotels and I really enjoyed my stay here  The location is the best  You can walk everywhere  If you need to get around the quotGrandquot station of the Red line of the L is literally at the hotels door  My room was very clean and it was very comfortable for relaxing as well as for working  The heat worked perfectly  Front desk staff was efficient  The housekeeping staff was extremely nice  One thing that I really appreciate is the rooms refrigerator coffee maker and microwave  There is a grocery store across the street  From the hotel you can walk any where shopping  theater Navy Pier Park etc ConsThere is construction near by and the hotel is about a block from the fire station so there is some noise  Some how a lot of the guests do not realize that the metal doors of the rooms are probably a required for safety purposes and do not need to be slammed and you can hear people talking on the halls specially the typical screaming children but I this is not the hotel fault I will definitely recommend it and I will stay there again if I can  It is not ultimate luxury but it gets the work done flawlessly if efficiency and location at a reasonable price is what you are looking for  
P => Very Nice The Hilton Garden Inn was pretty much perfect  The staff were very friendly the room was well appointed and the location right next to the red line and in the middle of River North is excellent  It was nice to be at a hotel that doesnt nickel and dime you   wireless internet access was free  I didnt need to use the  hour pantry in the lobby but I was glad it was there if I did  The pool was small however and the fitness equipment was aging  Overall it was a great stay 
P => Its an ordinary Hilton    but shes in danger of slipping    Sorry late review   catching up   I normally stay at the Intercontinental  more out of habit and familiarity  but was unable to get in there    so booked in a hotel nearby as time was against me  As others have written  honestly and truthfully  I add  location is just right  You have everything you need at your doorstep    shops  restaurants red route the lively Rush and Division river  cabs     you name it  As a Hotel   it does what it says   supplies a place to sleep  Its clean  room has all the bits a hotel room should have    service is fine   staff do what they can and as effeciently as they can    Yes there were small gripes   and if you are a well tarvelled person the little things can really rub on you    I had them    You seem to wait an eternity for a lift    yes the air con is louder than normal    but all in all   it isnt such a bad place  Budget or deals will sway the ordinary traveller as to whether heshe stays there or not  Luck and timing will depend on whether the stay was good or not  
P => Great Location    Poor Service Let me start by saying I am a frequent traveler and have stayed at locations from various hotel brands around the world  I also am a former Hilton Diamond Member I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years with the last stay having some major issues  The stay was so bad Hilton sent a voucher to come again for a free nights stay  I let it expire and just recently ided to give the hotel a second try for a  night stay Hotel Positives Great location  Two blocks from Michigan Avenue  block from State St  A grocery across the street   blocks to Starbucks and some fabulous restaurants within  blocks  Also the red line is just out the front door for easy city transport Hotel NegativesCustomer service poor room cleaning poor management Before arriving I called and told the manager that my last experience here was subpar and I was coming back and would like a smooth stress free stay  The manager offered to honor the free night even though it was expired  Here is a snapshot of the stayst night Heater was broken and made a clanking noise every  seconds the whole night nd day The hotel had many key problems and issues  Enough to send apology letters out rd day     okayth dayVerbally insulted lied to and hung up on by il over a newspaper  Asked to speak with manager she refused   said she couldnt leave a note for the manager unless she was told what about  Hung up onSpoke with manager about the matter only to have him smirk and have very unprofessional demeanor th day the room was half cleaned  Arrived at night to a room with a dirty sink and toilet no towels dirty glasses no toiletries  Called down and asked and in return received towels cups and a bag of coffeecreamth dayReturn to the room in evening to again find an uncleaned room  Towels were left on bed  not in bathroom th day okayth day Room partially cleaned again  No towels againth day Went to check out and took the voucher down to be credited  Two managers had said they would be glad to honor it evn though it had expired  Gave it to Ronnie at the front desk she said she would credit it  Two hours later go to check out and notice it was never taken off  She then says it cant be used even though  managers said they would take it  It was their offer not mine as I had said it was expired     and only wanted a SMOOTH stay  Spend  hour arguing over the fact that they were renegging  Finally had to call Hilton Corporate who then called the hotel and made them credit the voucher After all this never did get a formal apology and never heard from the GM    only shift managers  Very poor service  Yes the location is great but Embassy Suites is across the street  block and Homewood Suites are  block as well  Stay at one of those 
P => Excellent Stay Excellent hotel and location  Walking distance to many attractions  Close to the Red line subway    taxi ride from Midway always cabs available outside of Hilton Garden Inn  Front desk people were more than helpful  They were intelligent polite and knowledgeable  Portillos hotdogsbeef sandwiches about  blocks away  Starbucks outside and across the street grocery store across the street  The rooms were clean and nice beds were comfortable tv was nice flat screen  All and all just the best place to stay with the best rates  Also a PF Changs right there too  
P => Has taken a slide in quality This used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago  However some recent stays with some issues has caused me to change my thoughts You cant beat the location just a few blocks off Michigan Ave  Right across the street is a JewelOsco grocery store  Tons of restaurant options and the Red Line EL stop is right outside the front doors Theyve also done some remodeling with new carpet and wallpaper in the hallways  Plus theyve installed quot HDTVs in the rooms  However all they have is standard definition and it looks bad Plus the ACheating units are showing their age  Its hard to maintain a comfortable temperature plus they are extremely loud Plus the internet both wired and wireless was down  The front desk didnt apologize and said it would be fixed in a few days Lastly getting our room serviced was an issue a couple of times even though we were gone by am and didnt return until late  
P => Wonderful I booked this hotel based on the tripadvisor recs and my previous experiences with HGI  I was quite pleased with my choice  First there is the red line right outside the door  Nordstroms is to your left and a full service Starbucks to the right  It was within walking distance of magnificent mile an easy walk to all stores and afun walk to Grant Park The hotel has room service and a small Starbucks downstairs  The rooms are a nice size with very comfortable beds with comfort adjustable mattressesfor the king anyway  Staff was veryvfriendly and so helpful  You cant go wrong staying here  
P => great location and convienent just returned from a convention in Chicago and we stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn  I read through the Trip Advisor tips and was very happy with this hotel  we took the CTA train in from OHare and blue line then switch to red line and the Grand Station stop is right at the hotel  Our room was perfect microwave and niced size dorm refrig  the grocery store across the street is a full size store vs convenience store and we were able to buy breakfast and sandwich fixings for our stay HUGE  savings from buying items at the convention site  They have a nice business center with  complimentary computers and printers  we were able to print concert tickets directions etc  very nice  The hotel is a short walk to Michigan Ave   half blocks  I am looking forward to planning a non business trip to Chicago and we will definitely stay at this hotel again 
P => Love this hotel This is our place to stay while in Chicago for sure  Just returned from our first stay at this hotel  Very friendly staff basic King room was fantastic and extraordinarily clean the beds are super comfortable and what a great view  Get a high floor if possible  We had to check out early for unexpected emergency at home and the staff was very understanding and compassionate  Weber Grill Restaurant off the lobby is very good and busy  Get there early  
P => Great Stay When traveling to Chicago we usually stay near the airport because it is cheaper  ided to stay downtown and the Hilton had very good rates compared to similar hotels  Staff was very friendly and efficient  Room was nice and the kids enjoyed the pool while I made use of the whirlpool  You can self park next door with the validated rate of day vs   to valet  The hotel is a perfect location near enough to Michigan Ave to walk and a Red Line subway stop in front of the hotel  I would have liked to have a breakfast included with the room    that was the only draw back  
P => Great place for the price This hotel is in a great location very close to lots of sights of interest to tourists  An easy walk to Michigan Avenue Navy Pier the Loop etc  There is a Jewel superket directly across the street as well so no need to spend a fortune on the morning buffet  A clean hotel with attentive staff Downsides parking is not cheap  wo in out privileges per day or  for daily valet with unlimited in out pool is quite small and gets crowded quickly rooms are a little on the small side Overall a good place to stay to be near much of what Chicago has to offer  
P => Some positives some negatives Positives   really good AAA rate for downtown   excellent location right next to red line train and close to restaurants bars N  Michigan Ave    very friendly helpful staff   nice rooms with comfortable bedsNegatives   be careful with reservations our rate did not have a guarantee on   beds or rooms  Desk said only king beds initially but fortunately was able to get  beds   Some floors have both smoking and non smoking rooms  Hallway smelled like smoke    Elevators were backed up at times   Lobby elevators and hallways were warm and humid   Internet connections never worked 
P => Great Location   Very Nice Hotel Very nice location staff was very helpful rooms were very clean  Has a pool which is a big plus  Would definately stay again  
P => Great location nice comfortable hotel I spent  days in Chicago on my own after running a Conference with work in Austin Texas  Ive heard a lot of people say oh theres nothing to do in Chicago but its a fantastic city to visit I preferred it to New York  Theres amazing architecture in all the high rise buildings great shopping parks the Navy Pier beaches theres a great boat ride round the Lake    what more could you ask for  Also as I travelled alone I found it pretty safe the tourist bus is the best way to get about I chose the Hilton as it was a pretty good hotel rate for downtown Chicago and very central  I wanted a nice safe hotel as I was alone and had never been to Chicago before  The hotel was in a perfect location lots of restaurants close by and cheap places to eat   McDonalds is down the street Its only a  minute walk to Navy Pier and the beach and Magnificient Mile is just a short  miniute walk away  Lincoln Park zoo is a approx  minute walk The hotel rooms were fantastic really big and comfortable luxury beds   just perfect  I never ate at the hotel so cant comment on that  The only downside is that the hotel staff were very rude every time I asked them how to get somewhere they would snap back get a cab which was not very helpful as a tourist I didnt let it spoil my trip thoughI would recommend this hotel and  days is long enough to spend in Chicago and enjoy the city have fun 
P => nice hotelgreat location My husband and I stayed at the Hilton this last weekend and it was great The hotel staff was very helpful and they give you a validation code for your parking which saves you like  a day The room was very nice and clean  We stayed on the th floor and had great views  The location was great we were in walking distance from shopping millenium park and the rriver  We did take the free trolley to Navy Pier and the bus to Lincoln Park  We didnt eat at the hotel restaurant Weber Grill but it was always busy  We would have probably eaten there if we had one more day but did snag some cheesecake from there and took it up to our room one night Overall a great experience  We would recommend to anyone couples or families  
P => Bargain with a great location Stayed here about a month ago and was very impressed  Its hard to beat this place for the price and location  The room was spacious and very clean plus you get free wireless  The location is excellent just a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue with plenty of shopping and great restaraunts all around  Went to the Rock Bottom Brewery across the street and the food and overall atmosphere was very good rooftop bar is great in the summertime  They dont have a breakfast at the hotel but the staff recommended an excellent place a few blocks away ys Cafe that was definitely affordable  If you want to go to Navy Pier the hotel staff also recommended that you could take a free trolley  blocks away  You also get a discount if you park in the garage attached to the hotel  if I remember right  Overall I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great stay and perfect location This Hilton Garden Inn was the perfect location for our trip to Chicago  We did ride the free trolley to Navy Pier but walked to area museums Race Street and the Magnificent Mile Plenty of restaurants within walking distance  The hotel was spotless had a real nice gym area and pool with a very helpful staff Their Internet is hard wired and seemed slow but thats the only thing I could even think about that was less than excellent The city view from our room was a real plus Be sure and do the fireworks at Navy Pier and if you like some nightlife check out Redheads piano bar a few blocks away Avoid UNO pizza 
P => Great hotel at a great location Very nice hotel and a perfect location  Free internet The internet is through an ethernet cable but who cares if you cant carry your laptop around your room  I didnt try the complimentary breakfast but you are in Chicago  Get out of the hotel and try some of the best food in the world Footsteps away from the CTA red line  When you walk out of the hotel the stairs to the red line train are directly to the right  If you are familiar with riding the train in Chicago it is perfect  If you are there to see a Cubs game you get on the northbound red line train and get off at the Addison stop which drops you off at the stadium The hotels entrance has an unloading area on Grand that is convenient for pulling into for unloading your group and luggage  An attendant will ask if you will be valet parking  Valet is  per day with in and out privileges  Self parking is  per day after you have the parking ticket validated at the front desk  The regular price on the sign in the garage is  per day  The self parking garage is connected to the hotel with entrances on both Grand and Ohio  If you are planning on parking your car and leaving it during your stay this is the way to go  If you do self parking ask for the front desk to validate your ticket before you leave  When it is time to depart youll then insert your card into an automatic payment machine just outside the lobby to the right that you can pay with a credit card or cash When I go back to Chicago I am definitely going to be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn   Downtown  
P => enjoyed the stay The rooms were spacious and clean looked like new  The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room had a refrigerator coffee pot and free internet access  It is located just   blocks from Michigan Avenue and is near a lot of restaurants and shopping  Several theatres are within a short walk   blocks  The only negative was that housekeeping did not attempt to clean our room until after  pm when we were getting ready for dinner and a show  I would stay here again  
P => Great Hotel Hilton Garden Inn is a wonderful place to stay in Chicago  We stayed the week of   and it was fantastic  Our room was clean and neat throughout our stay  We got to stay on the nd floor which had fantastic views  Our children enjoyed the pool several times during our stay  The staff was wonderful One item that not too many people mention is the convenience of having a refrigerator and a microwave in our hotel room  There is a grocery store right across the street and we were able to stock up on sodas waters orange juice fruit etc  at very reasonable prices  We even purchased cold cuts for sandwiches and had lunch in our rooms to help save money  Every bit helpsWe had an excellent stay the beds were extremely comfortable and the hotel itself is in a perfect location  I would recommend it to anyone  
P => Bad Experience This hotel seemed like a good deal and its location is great for sure  The room was nice enough   However the problems began as we checked in for our one night stay  Rude staff were the norm  For instance we had a couple of little questions and needed directions pretty standard stuff but the staff ignored us and when we did get their attention seemed very put out  And were Hilton Honors membersThere were also lots of little inconveniences   very little sound proofing so we heard EVERYTHING that took place in the hallway all night long   no WiFi just plugged in internet so you have to keep your laptop on the desk in the corner when in the room  the printing services that were advertised did not work and again no one was available to help us use them  we ran out of toothpaste and found there were no complimentary toiletries if you forgot something purchase for  plus only And at the attached restaurant absolutely the WORST breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel  We had to leave early so it was one of the only places open at that hour  Big mistake  Even at am the food was cold stale and generally bad  The omelettes made to order were the only good option available  And this for something like   Im sure its good for other meals but avoid the breakfastIm confident you can find something better in Chicago for this price  
P => Solid hotel with good location Location is great right on north side of river   good restaurant in lobby weber nice clean rooms   the quotgotchasquot  gt loud AC in the roomsgt the internet access is ok but kinda slowgt the starbucks in the lobby isnt worth it   not a full BUX take a walk to a real one 
P => Great stay Great location very clean and the staff were very friendly  The room had everything we needed and was very comfortable  
P => Great Location Just got back from Chicago and wanted to write my review while everything is fresh in my mind  We arrived in the early afternoon and our room wasnt ready  Check in was at pm so that was fine  They held our bags and we did some sightseeing  Returned to the hotel and our room was ready  On first entering our room which was  there was a slight odor  Not bad or anything  Then when I went into the bathroom there was a mildewy smell  I really hate that smell  But it wasnt so bad to ask for a room change  There is no fan in the bathroom and with no air circulation the mildewy smell is going to occur  So those are some things that bugged me  The staff at the front desks changes often  Most of the staff isnt really that helpful  We asked once for a restaurant recommendation and was given the answer quotthere are a lot of restaurants here is a listquot  That isnt really what I was looking for  Then we asked directions several times and they just werent helpful and didnt seem to care  There is one perk  Warm cookies are offered around  to  and I think again a bit later in the evening  The red line train stops right in front of the hotel so that is another plus  The location is great  Close to everything  I dont think I would stay here again without attempting to try another hotel first  It isnt that I had a bad stay but I think I could have had a bit of a nicer room without the smells and staff that would love to help me more  
P => Glad I was moved here I was originally booked at The Silversmith for my trip to Chicago for NeoCon however because I had booked through Orbitz my room was not guaranteed and The Silversmith was oversold  They moved me to the HGI and Im glad they did It was closer to the Merch t so I could walk there instead of taking a cab there are many restaurants nearby including the Weber Grill attached to the hotel the service was great and the room very comfortable  Because I arrived around  am I had the choice of waiting for a regular King room or taking a King Wheelchair room right away and I took the Wheelchair room  I dont think the room size is much different but the bathroon is big enough for a wheelchair to spin donuts in and has a wheel in shower with a quotrainquot style showerhead  The beds are interesting they are like a Sleep Number bed with controls on each side to change the comfort level  A refrigerator and microwave were much appreciated and FREE wired internet access the first free access I have come across in Chicago  My only complaint is that the drapes do not cover the entire window  There is a   foot space above the AC unit that the sheers cover but not the drapes and the morning sun shone right on my pillow  Its a good thing Ineeded to be up early Also there was some sort of computer issue when I checked in and when I returned to my room the afternoon of the nd day my keys didnt work  When I went to the desk I was told that I had only been booked for one night but when I showed them my receipt from the Silversmith stating it was a two night trip they fixed the error quickly with no hassles  All in all I enjoyed my stay here and am glad I was moved 
P => Nice but not quiet The hotel has a lot to like   comfy beds a nice if small pool area if you have a child in tow free broadband wired and friendly staff  However its not quiet  There is a substantial gap at the bottom of each door so hallway conversations and door slamming will be clearly audible  The windows have good sound insulation but the AC units do not so traffic noise and sirens pour in at all hours I liked it well enough but the noise coming in was loud enough that it kept my three year old from getting to sleep  I understand its a hotel in the middle of the city but thats too loud  
P => Great Location and positive experience My boyfriend used some Hilton Rewards points to book two nights here  We had a lovely stay  I love the location close to many restaurants shopping and night life  Our room was very comfortable and quiet  We  not have had immediate neighbors because we didnt hear any of the other guests  The bathroom and tolietries were nice and the bed was comfortable  We had coupons for the complimentary buffet might have been because my boyfriend has a high status in Hilton Reward Points and it was very filling  I would defininately stay here again and would recommend it to others  
P => Excellent For a reasonably priced hotel in downtown Chicago this place is hard to beat  The rooms are smallish but clean and recently updated  The bed in my room was extremely comfortable there was a fridge and microwave a great office chair and a well designed bathroom  The staff were universally excellent especially the valet parking guys who deserve special praise for being friendly quick and efficient One quibble no Wi Fi in the rooms just an Ethernet connection with a cable that doesnt very far past the desk  On the positive side theres a  hour business centre that allows guests to print documents either on site or from their rooms  Also the heater is pretty noisy so if you tend to be cold at night and are also sensitive to white noise this  not be the place for you Breakfast at Webers downstairs is an extortionate  and ys Diner down the street serves bland and greasy food  Theres a Starbucks in the lobby thats open only in the morning another around the corner thats open all day long and a local chain called Cos  a block east which serves breakfast bagels etc  Not a gourmet experience but definitely edible  Otherwise the location is fantastic    within walking distance of all the attractions of the Magnificent Mile easy access to the El etc Id definitely stay here again  
P => almost perfect Very nice location just a couple of blocks off North Michigan Ave  shopping area  Super comfortable beds and VERY CLEAN room  Included microwave amp frig  We really liked the hot tub and the pool was comfortable temperature for this time of year  actually warm enough to swim in  Staff was friendly and helpful  The only things wrong were quite minor  Such as heater blower could have been a bit quieter and bathtub was a bit slow to drain  Would definately recommend it for anyone wanting a cleancomfortable well located and resonably priced hotel  
P => Just one night I stayed in this hotel for one night and I would definitely recommend it  Not only were the rooms spacious and very comfortable but the location is excellent The staff were fantastic very helpful to a couple of weary travelers My only quibbles were that I had an ajoining room where the folks through the connecting door were loud very loud at am in the morning and you could hear everything between the doors  It also took me awhile to figure out how to use the bath and shower but I figured it out I would recommend the hotel if youre going there though check out ys for breakfast   head out the front door and go left  blocks and its there  
P => Very clean and spacious excellent location Booked this hotel through priceline for a quick business trip  Very clean and quiet very well appointed and spacious rooms and excellent location  Business center and indoor pool were added bonuses  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Great hotel   Great Location My husband and I stayed in this hotel for  nights in uary   The hotel was a in a great central location close to all of the local tranport  The hotel has recently been refurbished and the rooms are lovely and bright  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Chicago area  
P => Couldnt have wished for better accomodation and location We booked this hotel after reading other reviews on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed  This hotel is definitely more than a three star in our eyes  Checking in was painless and we were able to check in early with no problem  The staff were friendly and helpful The room was lovely beds extremely comfortable  The room was very clean and tidy  The housekeeping did an exceptional job everyday we stayed there The location was excellant also very easy to walk to the Magnificent Mile and into the city  The hop on and off bus stop was not that far away either Overall it was the best accomodation for value for money we have stayed in  
P => Good base of operations Ill preface by saying the hotel is being reated and should be complete in ch we stayed on an quotoldquot floor so take some things in stride  We went for a weekend shopping trip and booked a room because of a ent price and good location  The check in and all interactions with the staff was excellent  They were friendly professional informative helpful and always pleasant   The room seemed small at first because of the dark colors but is really adequate with a small kitchenette amp nice work area  The work station had a nice sized desk comfortable office chair and was well lit  I dont hear well so if I note it it is definitely loud  The old heatcooling unit was rather loud and annoying  The sirens from below bothered my wife we were on the th floor  It wasnt a busy weekend but we both heard everything in the hallway  The bed was comfortable for me too soft for my wife  The bathroom was clean and the rest of the room seemed okay but had some suspicious deficiencies such as stains on the chair drapery wall and ceiling dont ask me  The TV hutch was very dusty on top we were going to store some purchases out of the way there   we ided against it  The carpet probably could have used a good cleaning  Im not sure how much theyve been delaying maintenance because of the reation so some issues might be rectified by  To be fair I did not contact the management about the situation  Room service is from either the Weber Grill on the ground floor or from Buca de Beppo on block east  We had ribs at the Weber Grill they were good but thats another story  Given the service price and location and assuming that the reations reduce the noise and cleanliness issues we would recommend this property as a good base for your time in downtown Chicago  
P => Great Every Time Great hotel very clean and st very friendly and helpful staff good food free internet great location not too big nor small   just great really Stay here all the time when in Chicago 
P => Great location and value The Hilton Garden Inn DowntownMagnificent Mile provides good accommodations great location and a reasonable price  Located at StateGrand the hotel is a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile shopping area has a subway station Grand on Red Line right at its door and has numerous restaurants in walking distance  Rooms are not lavish or large but are clean and ent provide a mini fridge mini microwave and coffee maker  Small business center has  computers with free Internet access used by a couple of teenaged girls surfing MySpace when I was there  There is a small pool and tiny fitness room  Weber Grill restaurant is a ent chain type barrestaurant for steaksribsburgers  
P => A great hotel This hotel was great especially for the price and location  I was expecting a dump becasue it was so cheap and I dont like to read many reviews before staying somewhere because I tend to remember other peoples comments  We paid around night for the weekend before X mas which was a great deal  The room was clean the beds were very comfortable and I enjoyed the free wireless internet and in room fridge  The rooms were on the medium side but who goes to Chicago to sit in their room The front desk staff were VERY nice and offered us a free shopping map that was very helpful  We parked in the hotel ramp and paid night to park  This is CHEAP by Chicago standards I paid night to park a block away last year  The location is GREAT and is very close to the Mag mile  Theres also ESPN zone across the street a close McDonalds and a new Subway practically kitty korner to the hotel  We went at lunch and it was empty becasue they are new and its kind of off the beaten path   Weber Grill is in the lobby area and you can smell grilled food in the hotels hallways even  floors up but the rooms DO NOT smell  We heard a lot of people in the halls but no one in the next room  Also Chicago is a loud city and youll hear sirens all night but this has happened at every hotel Ive stayed in Chicago  The pool area is small but if you just want to relax for a while itll work   I would definatley stay in this hotel again  You can look but you will not find another quality hotel this close to the Mag Mile for this price  Im pretty picky about nice hotels and this one passed by standards  
P => very convenient great value I would return here for a clean safe comfortable place in an ideal central location for touring with great service at the front desk  We stayed at the Peninsula a few years ago and that is a knock your socks off world class luxury hotel  This is not    its a nice business class Hilton family property  But I would actually prefer to return to this one instead of the Peninsula because it is more centrally located and I dont need to pay for all that luxury when we are out touring all day  We like to walk and we were able to walk to the boat tours the old shall Field in the Loop Berghoff the Sears Tower Navy Pier the Magnificent Mile and the Hancock building all from the HGI  The Peninsula was a little bit further north less convenient to the Loop and so we found ourselves using many more cabs  We had a great lunch at Berghoff weekday lunches on the main floor are as good as ever including the homemade root beer and we also had a lot of fun at dinner and great traditional food in a German neighborhood place to the north the Chicago Brauhaus in Lincoln Square  
P => I can see clearly I was in Chicago to have lasik surgery and the lasik center recommended this hotel because it was close and they give a discount for people going to the center  We got there before check in because of my appointment time and the front desk was great  The room was not ready but said that they would keep our bags and take them to the room when it was ready  The woman working at the desk and the gentleman that helped with the bags were so nice  They both ask how I was doing when I got back from the center and also told us about the restaraunts in the area  It was a great stay 
P => Disappointed       This hotel has so many good reviews that we ided to book it for our two week stay in Chicago   years ago we stayed in the Palmer House Hilton so thought wed try its little sisterWere now in the second week of our stay and I must say Im really disappointed in the hotel  Dont get me wrong the hotel itself is ideally placed with the red line El Grand right outside the door and the Mag Mile within walking distance  Also the staff are friendly and the room bigger than expected clean and tidy Our main issue is noise  From everywhere  Were on the th floor and can hear absolutely everything either of our neighbours does especially when in the bathroom which is embarrassing for both parties You can hear word for word everything your neighbour says if youre in the bathroom whilst theyre talking in their own room  At nightime you can hear the toilets flushing on either side and if someone ides to have a late nightearly morning bath or shower then believe me youll know about itAlso even with the quotdo not disturbquot sign positioned on your door youll be sure to hear the maids as they go about their daily duties shouting out to each other from the other end of the corridor  Weve also had other guests stand outside our door and have animated conversations on their mobiles or with other guests in the middle of the night  The air conditioning unit is another story altogether and for the first few nights ours was coming every ten minutes then going off again  We reported this and were advised an engineer would look at it but havent heard anything since  Weve came up with our own way of making sure the outburts are now shorter so our sleep isnt disturbed too much during the night We considered asking for a room move but reckon all the rooms must be the same weve came to the conclusion that the walls are made of tissue paper All in all the hotel is certainly a nice place and has the bonus of having three pcs in the business centre which you can access free internet but please if youre coming here for peace and quiet then Id choose another hotel  
P => We loved the Hilton Garden Inn We booked our hotel in early ember for a one night stay in early ember  We used expedia and got a rate of  plus tax  The great thing is that parking is only  a night if you self park with no inout privelages  The parking garage is attached to the hotel so it is convenient  We had a room with a king bed microwave mini fridge coffee maker blow dryer and more  The room felt exceptionally clean  The bed was a therapeutic  The comforter was white and soft and you could tell it is kept clean  It felt like home not the tacky old multi colored comfortersbedspreads many hotels use  The view was good  The staff was nice and helpful  There is a pool and jacuzzi tub on the  floor along with a business center  The pool is a bit small but very clean and the jacuzzi was wonderful  The hotel is in a great location with easy walking to the magnificant mile on Michiagn Ave and much more  There is a mini starbucks store right in the lobby  The restaurant P F  Changs is attached to the hotel along with a grill with a nice bar  I would go back to this hotel again even if I didnt get the same great rate  It is tough to get that low of a parking rate at most hotels  
P => Very Good Stay I attended a convention the week of   th  Before I made my reservation I tried to obtain a room at one of the more exclusive hotels but they were sold out due to several conventions scheduled that week  The Hilton Garden Inn was a very pleasant surprise  My room offered a good view of the cityline good size and comfortable linens  I am very picky about my sleeping quarters and this was very suitable and very clean  The bathroom was adequate  The service and staff was great This was my first trip to Chicago and I wanted to experience the luxurys that Chicago offers  The hotel is in a great location and the Weber Grill located in the hotel had good steaks  Also on the corner I dined at PF Changs which is always very good  Make sure you visit the Hancock Observatory and dine on the upper level for lunch make sure you visit the restroom for the view  Also you cant miss the Navy Pier  My favorite of course was the shopping on the Magnificent Mile What an experience  Needless to say I came with luggage weighing lbs and left with lbs and two carry on shopping bags  
P => No luxury hotel   but good value for money I stayed in this hotel for leisure for five days and was overall quite satisfied with my experience  The big advantage of this hotel is its location   it is very conveniently located in the near north area just two blocks away from MagMile and a few more from the Loop  It is also one of the more inexpensive hotels in this area and offers spotlessly clean rooms free high speed Internet access and comfortable beds  The service we received was efficient and faultless  Additionally I found the hotel much more quiet than I expected from reading some of the reviews on Tripadvisor  All in all I found it was a good base for exploring Chicago What are the downsides The rooms as well as the lobby are a bit on the small side by US standards  The lobby and the adjacent Weber Grill Restaurant can become pretty crowded at times especially during breakfast and dinner quotrush hoursquot  The Starbucks in the lobby has very limited opening hours actually it was closed most of the time when I fancied a hot drink which is not a big problem as there are various grocery stores and cafes around the hotel  All in all it is not really a luxurious place to stay but rather a hotel that offers above average standard at reasonable prices Would I stay there again On a similar occasion yes  
P => very ordinary The hotel is in a great location however the rooms and amenities are below expectations  The night I stayed their website price was  a night   I pricelined for about   The latter price was more than enough  The rooms are small  The staff are way less than three star  Take it from a seasoned traveler     ok but dont pay a lot for this  
P => Very good hotel very good hotel ideally situated  everything is within walking distance  very clean  friendly staff  it has a pool with a small jacuzzi a business center and high speed internet in the room  the best thing about this hotel is that its a very quiet hotel although it is located in downtown Sita amp Gieta 
P => Great location small pool Stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago  Staff were all really friendly and helpful  Room was pleasant as you would expect  The hotel location is great walking distance for the Magnificent Mile shopping and The Loop  There are plenty of barsrestaurants in the area including the Weber Grill attached to the hotel  There is a pool amp jacuzzi however no sauna or steam room and the pool is very small indeed There is free internet access in the rooms or in the business centre if you havent brought your laptop 
P => Friendly staff lovely room fantastic location I booked a room for myself and a friend through Hotwire and got a good deal on the room  At check in the staff were friendly and helpful and the desk staff always had a friendly smile and greeting whenever we passed through reception regardless of what time of the day or night it was  The room had two queen sized beds and we experienced no problems with house keeping the bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean every day  We had breakfast in the Weber Grill attached to the hotel on the first day and it was the only low point of the stay  The breakfast was cold this was at am and breakfast sevice ended at   am and expensive but the waiting staff were very nice and on another visit this time for lunch the food was very good  Most of the other guests were also quite young and there seemed to be a few bachelorette parties staying but even so it didnt seem too noisy  Overall a fantastic hotel with an unbeatable location  
P => Fast response from House Keeping We were stuck at Chicago OHare on lay over as the airport shut down due to weather  We were very happy to be able to snag a room for the night our rate was about   Since we arrived without our bags at check in I asked for a basic toiletry kit  They said they would call housekeeping  Nada  I call housekeeping they quickly brought toothpaste and brush for one we needed  plus do they have a bathrobe Another quick response and we had what we requested  I expected the hotel could provide an actual kit with shaver deodorant comb toothpastebrush etc Food Call room service no response  Try again busy signal  Again no response  Call front desk they tried no response  quotmust be busy try again laterquot  We keep trying and finally after about  minutes we are connected with room service  Room delivery was speedy and the pizza was good along with the Mrs  Parks house cabernet Bathroom The shower curtain needed changing as it smelled moldy  As I showered even though I was careful to get the curtain all right I still flooded the floor  There were only  towels for the room and I hated to waste the quotsparequot on the floor to mop up the water  Water pressure was okay plenty of hot water and there is a supply of soaps and lotions and shampoo Roombed Nice layout with desk sitting area and then the flat panel TV  Comfy bed with a pillow top  Down comforter and pillows soft sheets  Cozy for the weary traveler Breakfast No complimentary breakfast  Food was good and service great Check out Simple  Grab an airport shuttle at the front door and back to OHare It looked like a nice location the area was very clean a nice area of the city  Obviously we didnt spend much time there  
P => Great experience My family and I just spent  nights at the Hiton Garden Inn Chicago and had a great stay  Every staff member we had contact with from check in to check out was totally professional and went out of their way to be helpful  The location of this property is great for getting to shopping dining and the shows  Be sure to inquire about the breakfast package especially if you are traveling with children  
P => Wish I had stayed longer I only stayed here for one night in y but I wish it had been longer  The room was excellent with a king size bed and it was without doubt the comfiest bed I have ever slept in even without using the possible adjustments  I did not want to get up in the morning There was also the use of a fridge which is always a plus with me  It is nearby to shopping areas including a very useful superket where I got an international phone card  The pool is small but at   pm I had it to myself  I went to the Weber Grill for breakfast where the staff were friendly and I got the most delicious pancakes freshly made for me  I was sorry to leave so soon  
P => Great location nice hotel  We stayed at this hotel for a weekend girls get away for some shopping and clubbing  Overall we really liked the hotel  It was clean the rooms were nice albeit rather small the beds were VERY comfortable and we had an amazing view from our corner room  The location cant be beat  We found the staff to be curteous and helpful  I would recommend this hotel for sure  And one other perk   a Starbucks in the lobbey   
P => Great Chicago location We picked this hotel based on the good reviews and also its close proximity to the Magnificent Mile boat cruise and other attractions  We were able to walk with small children to many of our destinations  Also the hotel is a short distance from one of the free trolley stops As for the hotel itself Check in went very fast  Our clean room had two comfy queen beds that had tons of great pillows  We stayed on the st floor so traffic noise wasnt a problem  The bathroom was a nice size and our room had a mini fridge microwave coffeemaker and high speed Internet access  The swimming pool was small but it served the purpose  The hot tub was clean and the whole swimming pool area was in nice shape with lots of clean towels  Two floors of the hotel had wireless Internet access  On one side of the lobby is a Starbucks that was open in the morning hours and on the opposite side is the Weber Grill  We didnt go to either one but the Weber Grill was packed for dinner so they must be doing something right  The hotel has valet and self parking  The parking structure is connected to the building and has easy access to the hotel  Parking was   a day which was reasonable considering other hotels charge much more  My only complaint is that the concierge didnt know a thing about the free trolley service so he wasnt much help to us Id stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again for the convenient location  At less then   a night I thought it was a good deal for being in the heart of Chicago  
P => Perfect choice for Chicago trip After reading all the tripadvisor reviews we ided to go for this hotel  Good choiceWe ve stayed here  nights and everything was really good The hotel itself is clean nicely orated nothing special but just as you would expect from a Hiltongarden inn and the location is really perfect Downtown close to the nicest stores attractions bus stops and restaurants greatThe staff is VERY friendly the breakfast at the Weber Grill which was free for us as Hilton Honors members is really nice and everythings freshly prepared to your order  The room we had was very spacious and clean  I would really recommend this hotel  
P => Girls Weekend at the Hilton I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn the weekend of y th  As other reviewers have noted this hotel is in a great location  It seemed we were able to walk everywhere As Hilton Honors members we received free breakfast buffet coupons at the Weber Grill connected to the hotel  Good buffet   nothing fancy   but a great way to start the day with made to order omelettes pancakes potatoes french toast bacon sausage pastries etc The hotel is definitely understaffed  There always seemed to be a line at the front desk regardless of the time of day  I needed to call on three arate occasions for a wake up call and was put on hold for over  minutes each time The rooms are nothing fancy and seemed a bit small but were clean and had comfortable beds I have stayed at this hotel before and would stay again  
P => Big Hotel well positioned small rooms In Chicago for a conference  Stayed at the Hilton for its location which was great  Good facilities good health suiteindoor pool  Food and service very good  Rooms clean well maintained although rather small  
P => Great for Young Teenagers Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn downtown in mid  with a group of  th grade trip of  students   parents  We had a great time The location cant be beat as it was easy walking distance to many restaurants Navy Pier Michigan Avenue etc  We used plenty of public transportation trolley city bus subway quotelquot which were very easy to access  The staff was extremely helpful with transportation questions  The kids loved the small pool which is to be expected in downtown Chicago  We purchased breakfast foodssnacks at the Jewel Osco across the street and stocked the in room refrigerators  Rooms were just the right size and the elevators were quick Would stay here again in a heartbeat 
P => Great location and clean rooms I recently stayed in this Hotel again I again got a clean room that was not that noisy because it was on the th floor  The bed was great to sleep in and they had free high spped internet Thx to my HH status I got invited to breakfast   which was served at the hotel restaurant called Weber Grill  It was a good buffet with great bacon and lovely pancakes The location of the hotel can not be beaten it is a  minute walk from North Michigan Ave right next to a CTA subway station and close to many bars and pubs It is not a luxery hotel but great for what you pay for 
P => Enjoyed the Hilton Garden Inn I stayed in Late il Early  for a Seminar and this hotel was just fine  The room was sufficient and was less money then the Seminar sponsored hotels and it is only three blocks from Michigan Avenue and all the action  There is a subwaymetro entrance directly in front of the property if you need public transport but not to be confused with EL or the Elevated Train which could be loud in the evening  Great Stay and Drama Free   
P => What you need to know Getting to this hotel from OHare by public transport is very easy but  not be ideal if you have a lot of luggage or a few kids  Hop on the blue line switch at Jackson to the red line get off at Grand and the hotel is at the top of the stairs cost  The journey takes about an hour  The red line also takes you to Wicked get off at Randolph and Washington  We always found a queue at reception the staff continuously stopped dealing with customers to answer the phone be a telephonist would solve the Q problem  The room was a little gloomy but clean the air con was one of those huge old boxes and was very very loud nothing subtle about it at all  The traffic noise was considerable but in a downtown hotel that is to be expected  However this faded into insignifcance when compared with the constant mysterious droaning noise the sort of noise that hurts your whole body and not just your ears  We hoped it would go but it didnt we tracked it down to pipes lurking behind a door on the opposite side of the corridor I asked for a different room  The hotel was fully booked and it would be midnight before the staff knew of cancellations the receptionist promised to call before she went off duty to let us know if we could move she didnt call she promised to get us earplugs they didnt arrive she promised to leave a message for the next shift someone was to call us at  am she didnt appear to leave the message and they didnt call  Finally after explaing the whole story again the following morning we were moved a lower room worse traffic noise but that was ok             until the dripping started  I awoke in the early hours to hear water dripping onto the ceiling above the bed it was very annoying I left a note and a generous tip for housekeeping and asked that they report this problem  I returned from my day out to find it had not been resolved the guy on reception said he would deal with it immediatley I returned after Wicked went to bed and woke in the early hours with drip drip drip    So  sleepless nights in the Hilton Garden Inn On the plus side breakfast in the Weber Grill was good very attentive staff and eggs pancakes and omlettes made to order  Cosmopolitans at the bar were great Out and about exit front door and turn right walk along a few blocks and you will come across a good Irish Bar Fado  On this same street you will find a Rain Forest Cafe a Hard Rock Cafe and the anniversary McDonalds the poshest Mickey Ds you will ever see and the only one I have ever been in where the food in real life is as good as the photographs  You will also find a stop for the Hop On Hop Off tour which was very good value but its the luck of the draw when it comes to guides  We had Baron quotthe sexiest tour guide on the planet even if he did say so himselfquot he was interesting and funny the next guy wasnt so hot  Good stops are the Navy Pier a little quiet during our visit the art museum which had more Monets than you could shake a stick at the aquarium fab penguins and of course Sears Tower well organised and no real queues We saw Wicked which was good but not great Elphaba has a tremendous voice but lacked a bit of stage presence Glinda saved the show  I should add that we watched y Poppins on Broadway the previous week it was totally fabulous and perhaps this jaded our view of Wicked just a little bit  As noted in the prvious reviews the Mag Mile and Nordstroms are a few steps away  Chicago is a beautiful city for folk in Ireland Aer Lingus do direct flights from Dublin pop over for a few days you wont regret it Would I stay here again Yes if they could guarantee a good nights sleep  The location is superb and its good value for money 
P => Great Location ent Property The best feature of this property is the location  It is only a few blocks off Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile  A rail rapid transit station entrance Grand Street Station on the Red Line subway is right outside the door which is convenient especially if you are going to a baseball game as this line serves both U S  Cellular Field White Sox and Wrigley Field Cubs  The property itself is fine but nothing special  It is a standard Hilton Garden Inn which microwaves and refrigerators in each room  The rooms are smaller than the usual Hilton Garden Inn and also not as well furnished as most Hilton Garden Inns but are very clean if not quite spotless  Includes a fairly nice business center and small fitness room with a small but nice pool  As a bonus hotel guests have complimentary access to a large full service gym one block away  Instead of the usual non descript restaurant that is normally included in Hilton Garden Inns the Weber Grill restaurant is on the first floor  The food here is extremely good and it includes a lively bar  Breakfast includes a reasonably priced buffet with numerous choices including outstanding bacon and pancakes  The only complaint is that the hotel feels crowded as if the designers never thought it would sell out  The lobby is small and there are not really enough elevators to properly handle a full house which is what I encountered the weekend I was there  Most significantly the front desk was inadequately staffed resulting in long lines  The staff themselves were very helpful and efficient there simply were not enough of them to handle the volume of guests  Of course Hilton Garden Inn is not a full service hotel brand so a portion of this problem  be attributed to that fact  BOTTOM LINE A good choice if it is price competitive  
P => Perfect Location I was in town for the Paddys day celebrations and the hotel is great for visiting the countless pubs amp clubs of this great city  Staff were very friendly and helpful  The rooms were really nice and the Weber grill downstairs is great for food at any time of the day  All in all very good value for money  
P => Great location I recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Chicago  This was my second stay there and I will continue to go back  The location cant be beat  The Red Line Grand el station sits on the property  It is one block from Michigan Ave located on the backside of Nordstroms  There are endless bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel  The Weber Grill bar is a great place to grab a drink and appetizer  Also if you want a terrific breakfast go to Snickers on the corner just a block north of restaurantbrewery across the street  Great little place    not fancy great hashbrowns and eggs for a low price  
P => Great location We stayed at the HGI on  and   It is very conveniently located to bus train and trolley  The buses run one block over on Michigan Ave There is a grocery store across the street  where you can buy a bustrain pass for   for  day  The hotel was very nice clean  The beds were comfortable  The room had a microwave mini fridge and internet connection  I called the hotel to make reservations because we wanted adjoining rooms  I didnt see any place on their website to make that request when booking two rooms  They said that they couldnt guarantee adjoining rooms  I called the morning of  and asked if they would be available  We were able to get two adjoining rooms with king size beds  We were happy It helps to be flexible  I would recommend this hotel to everyone  
P => Fine but not the best Have stayed here on several occasions before and I have to say that this time round I was a little disappointed   nothing particular but on previous stays Id been put in rooms on the higher floors of the hotel and I remember them as more spacious and comfortable than the room I was given this time on the th floor  Terrible soundproofing which wasnt a problem last time I stayed meant that I could hear everything from both rooms next door   the TV people in the bathroom etc etc  Also the room was a bit more tired and less spacious than I remember  However couldnt complain too much   the price was good it was perfectly clean and staff are helpful and friendly   its efficient and in a great location  I just think that there might be better deals out there if you look around   however would be happy to stay here again  
P => Buyer Beware On ch th I booked a  night stay in  at this property for  per night  I quickly realized that I had made a mistakeand the next day tried to add an additional day  On the internetat Hiltons website they allowed me to add an additional dayat   for each day of my stay  Most hotel companies willsay quotwere delighted that youve ided to stay an extra day with usHilton says quotthis is our opportunity to rape youquot  I was upset enough that I canceled the entire reservation  Today ch thwe called this lovely property and were politely told there wasnothing they could do for us  Mind you we have been HiltonHonor members since yt    I would be willing to take betson how many times you think I will stay at a Hilton property forthe rest of my life  There are too many hotel companies that really do care about their customers  
P => great great hotel in the heart of the city close to everything  excellent amenities pool jacuzzi computer use etc and good service  only drawback the room or is too flowery although beds are comfortable and bathroom well equipped  
P => very nice We had two rooms for our family of six and while they were not connecting we had no issues  The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quite  The location was great with tons of things within walking distance  Wed stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => NIce clean Hotel  great Location Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn ch     The hotel is in a great location with Nordstroms  block over and Michigan Ave   blocks  The Navy Pier is straight down Grand Ave  and a nice walk if the weather is nice  probably about  blocks  We got up and ran along Lake Michigan one morning  We were on the st floor at the Hotel  It was very quiet from street noise however the doors slamming automatically in the halls are loud and annoying  The room has a small microwave fridge and are large  The beds are comfortable and firm  NOt the best I have slept on but adequate  We used the small fitness room which had  really good ellipticals and  lower quality treadmills  I also used the business center which is free to surf the web and print out my airline boarding passes  We got a buy  nights get third night free special which made the hotel very reasonable  The red line sub way is right outside the door and you can get to Lincoln Park area and Shopping on State very easy  A great seafood restaurant  Shaws is down a block  Highly recommended Buy your discount theater tickets on       overall I would stay there again  The rooms were very clean and the staff was great Did not eat at the Wevber Grill  
P => Good Hotel I stayed at HGI on  amp   Booked through Travelzoo for a great rate of   per night  It was very busy with basketball playoffs   not why I was there   so was glad I had booked far in advance  Great location just a couple of blocks off Michigan Ave  Nice rooms bathrooms etc  Would definately stay there again  Weber Grill restaurant that is attached is very nice  Try the artichoke dip appetizer and you will be very happy  Steaks are great too Self park and get validated at the front deak when leaving saves you some money  
P => Great location This hotel has a great location as others have stated  We used public transportation  the red line was at the door and the bus a short walk away  We received a corner room xx on a high floor  We had two windows and a great view  The fitness room is nice the pool is tiny  but I had it to myself at  am  
P => Worked for us My husband and I booked this last minute and went with the HGI based on price and location  It couldnt have been better for us  There is a red line stop just outside the front door so it was very convienent to everything from the loop to the water tower and beyond My only complaint was that they wanted  for a granola bar in the gift shop  Insanity  There is a JewelOsco grocery around the corner and a Trader Joes nearby so I stocked up the fridge in our room with juice and snacks Im pregnant and must eat constantly I know there is a pool and workout room but we didnt use it  I think this would be a great hotel for a family  
P => HGI rocks  Excellent stay  Excellent mid level hotel at a very convenient location and at a very good price for Chicago  Front desk service   Jessica and Diane were superb Super nice welcome and very helpful and efficient handling all requests perfectly  Room was on th floor with nice view North of Hancock Tower and was absolutely quiet spotlessly clean and comfortable  The nice amenities included complimentary high speed in room internet access fridge microwave perfect for families good sized desk lounge chair wottomon Neutrogena bath products as well as small pool amp hot tub and gymexercise room  This hotel also offered a quotBusiness centerquot with  computers printers and supplies of everything to do business along with conference rooms on th floor   for all guests  The hotel is   short blocks from famous shopping at Michigan Avenue and has the quotWeber Grillquot restaurant attached  We did not try the restaurant but it seemed perfect for meat lovers    priced like a steakhouse too Plenty of restaurants clubs bars in the area as well  Red Line subway station conveniently right outside front door Only very minor minus when the heatAC unit turns on like other HGI weve stayed at seems noisyloud at first but got used to it  No problem sleeping Yes wed stay here again    without hesitation  
P => Loved the HGI Booked  rooms at the HGI this past weekend thru Travelzoo for  back in ember  It was a mom and kids weekend and the hotel couldnt have been any nicer  We had requested an early check in which they accomodated and set us up in a corner of the nd floor all together They rooms are fairly laarge with a microwave and fridge and Neutrogena products  Everyone at the desk was helpful for directions transportation  The location was EXCELLENT  We walked everywhere and the Red line was right outside  The Navy Pier Trolley right up the street I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it Only drawbacks     the hot tub was not filled the entire time we were theree and after a cold day would have been appreciated  Secondly I would Not recommend the Webber Grill for breakfast   long lines at the buffet  
P => Veru nice great location   We found the Hilton Garden Inn to be very clean fresh and updated and the location cannot be beat  We got a great rate through the Hilton web site for  a night with our third night free  No breakfast is served but we did have a microwave and mini frigerator  There is a restaurant located off the lobby mainly barbque but room service is offered and numerous restaurants are within a block  The staff was very friendly and accomodating  The indoor pool is nice but small  Nordstroms and Northbridge Shopping Mall are a very short block away and Michigan Avenue aka the Magnificent Mile is two very short blocks from the hotel door  Parking is availible for a fee of course in a garage attached to the hotel and there is a heated circular driveway from which you  load and unload your car  Bell hops and valets are readily available but in no way is their service pushed upon you  We would definately stay in this hotel again  
P => Excellent Stay Great hotel Great location for a  day weekend in Chicago  Staff is friendly and helpful rooms clean and comfortable  Located  easy blocks from Michigan lots of great restaurants close by  mile walk down State to Macys former shall Fields the Red Line is steps from the front entrance a Jewel grocery across the street Trader Joes also  blocks away    We really found the location and accomodations to be great The front desk has a list of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood  We arrived at midnight and the front desk gave us several options for places to grab a bite at that late hour  We opted for Mother Hubbards State and Hubbard  This sports bar definitely was a locals only kind of find  Simple but good bar type food  Dont miss Volare a really nice Italian restaurant one block east of Michigan on Grand  My recommendation is to share an appetizer the rolled eggplant was exceptional pasta and meat course to get the best value and especially since servings are ample but not too large  
P => Loved the Location We stayed in this hotel for Christmas the hotel is great great location staff were so helpful  The Red train line is just outside the door and it is a  cab ride to the nearest blue line which we used alot which takes you to some great shopping malls  The breakfast was great as this was included in our room price lovely buffet  I have to say I missed my proper meals of what I like my potatoes and veg and meat which is very hard to get was sick of fast food by the second day  We ate in the restaurant in the hotel a few times and it was ok  I ordered room service one nite the chicken was cold and I ended up getting food poisoning which kind of ruined the holiday  But over all I cannot complain about the hotel and I would recommend the store across the street Jewel for stocking up on food as there is a fridge and microwave in the room  
P => Absolutely Perfect What a location We arrived parked our car and walked everywhere  It was such a breeze checking in the staff was incredible and only night We will definitely be coming back in the future  
P => Weekdn getaway with the kids Had a great stay with our two kids over the week of Christmas  Price was right  through Hilton website location was great Nordstroms for the wife and dhter ESPNZone for my son and me just around the corner and the staff was efficient and friendly  There are probably a dozen restaurants withina one block radius The exercise room wasnt huge but had three treadmills and some other machines  The pool was very small and overly chlorinated but the kids loved it just the same I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good price on it 
P => Perfect Location During A Perfect Weekend I came home last night from a two night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  I found a very good price for the New Years Eve weekend at hotels com  later a better price of   per night became available on travelzoo but I couldnt cancel by original reservation The location was perfect  We parked in the attached self park garage   nobody at the front desk mentioned anything about parking validation but I asked at check out  It saved   per day  Make sure you askThe room was very clean and spacious with a great view  There is a fridge and microwave which were very nice to have for our leftover meals that turned into a midnight snack  This  seem silly to some but the I loved the toiletries they provide  Neutrogena products  I like knowing what I am using instead of mystery brands  The Weber Grill is on the first floor and made for a great lobby bar  We ate breakfast there one morning and were disappointed to see that it was a buffet for   each  We were hoping we could order steak and eggs  Thats okay  The food was good   there was an omlete bar and you could order eggs cooked to your liking if the scrambled ones were not what you wanted  I appreciated the security at the hotel on New Years Eve  After pm you had to provide your room key and a picture ID before getting on the elevator  There were also strict rules regarding noise levels and multiple guests in rooms  We didnt have any issues but it was nice to know that if it were a problem something would be done  This was a perfect location for shopping dining drinking and fun  Ill be back 
P => So Convenient to Everything We stayed here for a Bears game and general sightseeing  With the Red line right outside the door we were able to go everywhere we wanted very easily  The hotel is also located right across from a very nice Jewel food store  Great for sodas or snacks Check in was a breeze and the employees very friendly  We had requested a king nonsmoking and a king smoking and both were ready for us  A nice security feature is you must use your room key to use the elevator Our room was fairly large especially for city standards and was spotless with very nice furniture  It also had a microwave and refridgerator along with a coffee pot  We had a view of the Hancock Building and the windows opened slightly for fresh air It had a good size bath that was also spotless and nice toiletries including lotion and mouthwash which is not often given  Good water pressure and plenty of hot water The beds were comfy and made up with double sheets which is a nice touch  Pillows were okay but of the foam variety and a little hard  Free internet is a nice feature but charges for local phone calls a little cheap in my opinion The Weber Grill is located in the hotel and serves a wonderful breakfast buffet with great service Overall a great stay and would definitely stay there again  Wonderful location just off Michigan Avenue and a nice clean friendly atmosphere  What more could you ask for  
P => ANOTHER GREAT STAY    This is our third stay in two years at this hotel  Terrific location and nice sized rooms  Having a microwave and small frig in the room is a definite plus particularly w a wonderful ket right across the street for snacks  Not really a nice view from this hotel but its a good value and a short walk to Michigan Avenue  My only complaint is w the hallway doors  They SLAM shut  and I mean SLAM You can hear everyone coming and going because they dont think to grab the door  Would definitely stay here again though    and probably will next Thanksgiving when we go back up to Chicago  
P => Outstanding in every way Five college friends and I had a delightful stay  From the exceptional customer service front desk housekeeping bellmen etc  to the large clean and comfortable rooms we found the hotel to be outstanding in every way  From the rd floor the view of the city was fantastic street side the location on Grand and State was great    just steps away from lively Michigan Ave  and all it has to offer  We were especially impressed at the hotel staffs willingness and abilitiy to honor our request for adjoining rooms    one with two beds the other a Murphy suite with a double bed large sitting area with sofabed plus a kitchenette  From our previous experience at other hotels we were not optimistic about the likelihood that wed get what we requested when we made the reservation  But by calling the night before arrival the front desk staff and housekeeping made sure we got what we asked for  Weve stayed at the  star Omni on previous trips and found the  star Hilton Garden Inn to be superior in every way  Well be back 
P => Such a relief My Mom and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn downtown Chicago this past ust on a girls trip  We stayed for  nights  The hotel was very clean the service was awesome staff was eager to help with any questions we had quiet rooms and comfy beds  The breakfast is the best downstairs The pool was a little small especially when there is  kids in it Mom and I were in Chicago for the King Tut exhibit at the Field Mueseum  As the hotel is a hop skip and a jump from the Magnificent Mile transit was super easy  We were originally booked into another hotel but after reading its review on this site we switched and we are so relieved we did One more thing Mom and I asked for a corkscrew from concierge  It got to our room super fast however it broke off in our bottle  Moral of the story Dont ask the hotel for a corkscrew  They are pretty cheap  
P => Very Good Hotel Stayed for just three nights in tember this year  The hotel is in a great location for just about everything  Good sized room with an OK view and everything was clean and well maintained  Staff across the board was very helpful  Weber Grill is great for breakfast   for buffet and also steaks  Highly recommended hotel  
P => We loved the location We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago for  nights last fall  Average priced for Chicago parking was located on site  We parked our car and walked or took public transportation everywhere we needed to go The check in was quick the lobby was attractive and the room was a nice size very clean and suprisingly quiet  We had a very nice view out our window  We had an adequate sized refrigerator and microwave in the room too Directly across the street from the hotel to the west was a Jewel Superket where we bought breakfast foods and snacksandwich foods to save some money on our trip There is a Weber Grill restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel that has a fantastic buffet breakfast we ate there on a Sunday morning   I dont know if its an every day thing or just weekends  Many many many other restaurants are located within walking distance  We walked to Ginos Pizza and Rainforest Cafe If you want to take the subway well its super convenient as the subway entrance is on the same corner as the hotel We bought a multi day pass and rode buses subways and El trains to all the tourist spots  John Hancock Building Magnificent Mile Navy Pier Shedd Aquarium to name a few Would also highly recommend quotChicago Hauntingsquot bus tour can walk from hotel to tour embarkment and Wendellas Lake and River tour  minutes 
P => Paper Thin walls This hotel has paper thin walls and you can hear evrything in the rooms next door and in the halls  I have stayed at  star motells that are more private  Also i called the hotel direct for reservations and then they transfered me to the central call center  i knew where the hotel was because of the Weber Grill in the lobby  The reservation center said that they had several downtown lockations and could not be sure that the one that they were reserving for me was the one that I had asked for with out an adress  
P => Worth every penny First I want to say that if it sounds a bit pricey to you it definitely worths every penny  The location couldnt be more convenient especially for a tourist in Chicago  In addition we found the staff friendly and helpful our room very nice extremely clean and spacious  One of the best hotels Ive ever stay and will stay there again if Im given the chance  
P => Great location and great place saw a  nights for the price of two promotion and booked  Saw another promotion on Travelzoo for  per night in ust could not beat that and booked  Arrived via the blue train and got lost  Tons of cabs and rode the cab four minutes to the hotel  Its noon and I wanted to check my bag because I scored a ticket to Wrigley on a Sunday  Im standing in line for the desk when I spot two bellman walk onto the lobby  Tell the guy my situation and boom claim ticket and down to the Red Line off to see the Cubbies  Back to the hotel after pm and checkin not problem in fact I think they pre assigned rooms king non smoking  Same room design as my last stay clean except for the drinking glasses  Microwave mini fridge and comp pass to a real fitness gym one block away  Jewels grocery across the street  Rental car not needed as public transit is pretty fast  Did rent a car the last day to drive outside of downtown and returned by pm  Scored a parking meter one block away from the hotel leaving by am so free all night  Second stay in this city at this hotel  My third will be here too  
P => What else can I say   Excellent Just returned from a five night stay at the Gardenn Inn and what can I say that hasent already been said   this place it just excellent  We travel a lot and would highly recommend this hotel  The front desk are just awesome  They wear a quotNo Problemquot badge and it isnt a gimmick they will do just about anything for you What a great location right by the red line  You wont be disappointed with this hotel  Also as info since I have not seem this before visit the Federal Reserve Bank its free and where else can you get so close to one million bucks and leave with  for free Also check out the Blue Man group show for a great time and guess what its right off the red line at Belmont and a quick ride back to the hote 
P => Great stay Stayed with my wife for  nights from  y until    US Airways managed to lose our baggage so on arrival check in staff provided us with toothbrush toothpaste etc which was a nice touch  I had asked for a corner room as had been recommended and was given one Hotel has all that is required including a  shop selling essentials a starbucks a smallish pool and hot tub  There is a business centre on the th floor with  terminals all providing free internet access and printers  On one occasion the printers werent working so the front desk did the online flight check in for me There is a Weber Grill attached to the hotel which does a great buffet breakfast for   and great food in the evening  There was a wait time of about an hour the evening we ate there but I called down mentioned I was staying in the hotel and got a table pretty quickly Location is great  Metro stop outside and Navy Pier free trolley just round the corner  Rooms were cleaned very well and even clothes on the bed folded  All in all for a  star hotel it was superb  Many people including Americans we met en route were suprised that wed take a vacation in Chicago but it was fantastic  Go 
P => Great     but My husband amp I just got back from a  night stay at the HIlton Garden Inn Chicago  Great location convenient to all of the wonderful Mag Mile shopping and the red line train  The wonderful staff were able to answer any question you might have about how to get around the City etc  Housekeeping was efficient polite and thorough My only complaint   the mattresses are horrible Im generally not a picky person but sleeping on a board took its toll after  nights  Until this hotel replaces its mattresses I probably wont come back 
P => Excellent Stay We enjoyed a four night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and could not have asked for more in a mid range priced hotel  The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful  Our room was clean and had the fresh look of a new or recently reated space  The bathroom had very good water pressure in the shower generous counter space and plenty of towels of adequate size  I loved the convenience of the mini fridge  A microwave was provided as well  The closet and drawer space was adequate  While the comfort level of the beds could not compare with my pillow top mattress at home the mattresses and pillows provided a reasonable level of comfort for a hotel  They were firm without being too hard  While we had some traffic noise even on the th floor the sound proofing within the hotel is excellent and we didnt hear any noise from the other rooms or even the hallway  The location is ideal for tourists with a Jewell grocery store across the street across from the Red Line subway stop and near bus stops and youre within easy walking distance of some of Chicagos best restaurants and the shops on Michigan Ave   We bought  day visitors passes for unlimited travel on the transit system which was really easy to get around on  To get to the Art Institute or the Museum Campus walk to Upper Michigan and Illinois and take bus no    To get to Lincoln Park Zoo walk to Grand and LaSalle and take bus no    If youre interested in the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright visiting Oak Park makes for a fun day out  Take the Red Line to the LakeClark exit and transfer to the Green Line and get off at the Harlem stop  All the sights are within easy walking distance  To get to Second City take bus no   from Grand and State  The Starbucks kiosk in the lobby sells pastries and coffee and Cosi is a chain about a block or two east on Grand that sells a good cheap breakfast  Also ys which is  or  blocks away  The front desk can give your directions  All in all a great place to stay  
P => Loved the hotel  An excellent night at the Hitlon Garden  Convenient and close to everything  Rooms are very nice and welcoming  Starbucks in the lobby is a plus  Service is great  No complaints at all  We recommend the hotel   Try priceline for a good rate  
P => Disappointing overpriced I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for  nights while traveling on business  The room rate of  per night was outrageous for an average to poor room with no amenities  The beds were not very comfortable the pillows were flat and the bedspreads were dirty  Yuck It was a disappointing experience  Our room smelled like an overdose of air freshener and I had a sinus headache every morning  
P => A Perfect Place for a Birthday We chose this hotel from the many available due to the comments made and the value offered  We were not disappointed in the least  From the check in to check out everything was wonderful except for the last night when housekeeping missed us which we think was due to having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door till AM  One call asking for them to do the room at PM when we left for a baseball game was all we needed  We were very lucky to get the  a beautiful corner room with a wonderful view  It was my th birthday and management sent up a bottle of champagne  What a lovely touch  This hotel has a great location   blocks from the Magnificent Mile kiddy corner from Nordstroms  blocks from the river right in front of the subway to the baseball park Very safe  We felt safer in downtown Chicago then most places we have ever been  The people are great the number of excetional resturants in walking distance is amazing  Do try Osteria via Stato just around the corner on State Street    prix fix menu that is incredible and thus why it was named to the Bon Appetit magazine top  restauirants in the USA  Great value Back to the hotel the bed is very comfortable and the window opened althought the noise even on the st floor could be a little loud but it is a big city  We thought the room size was just right for  and would definately stay here again for its value service and location  The full breakfast at Webers downstairs and that came with the room had everything we needed  Bacon sausages scrambled eggs or made to order french toast or made to order panckaes and omlettes  Fruit and a selection of breads rounded out the selction completed with fresh coffee and fresh juices  Had a great birthday and hope to come back soon 
P => absolutely fantastic My wife and I stayed there on a quotfunquot trip from il   and had a great time  The hotel room was clean and spacious with no unpleasant surprises  The staff was courteous and helpful at all times  We ate at the on site Weber Grill upon arrival and had the best burger in our livescomplete with fries and cole slaw all for   each  Most in hotel restaurants are priced out of our league but we were very satisfied and comfortable here  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the quotMagnificent Milequot  blocks from Navy Pier and five minutes from bus service to the Museums Bus  remember thatWe had plans to go somewhere else over Memorial Day but have ided to return to Chicago and the Hilton instead     our stay was that great    
P => One of the better value for money deal I was in Chicago for  weeks and stayed at HGI from    Ive also stayed at two other inn type of hotels in Chicago downtown area as HGI was full during the busy  conventionconferencesexhibitionspring break month  For  pernight I got a single rm with microwave mini fridge and the plusfree Internet connection most other places charges abt perday  The room was clean and bathroom was well stocked  The Netrugena line of products was a nice touch  The staff was very nice and friendly as well The location was ideal a trip from Ohare airport to hotel costs only USD and the subway station is just right outside the entrance It was convenient to get groceries with Jewell Osco opposite the hotel and not to mention the numerous eating places nearby  I was definitely spoilt for choices Ive been to other hotels and this is defnitely one of the better one under  bracket type in Chicago  
P => hgi very satisfactory stayed for  nights with last night in sofitel which i will review shortly location is excellant with jewel shop and subway stop across road and mag mile around corner room good size with fridge etc and clean staff always helpful weber grill attached to it lively breakfast average hgi not luxurious but very comfortable and well priced fridge in room a bit noisy so we plugged it out overnightin sumy no hesitation in recomending hgi  
P => Greta place to stay in Chicago Downtown I just returned from a stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  I booked this room based on the reviews posted on the trip advisor web site  I stayed  nights with my college aged dhter and her friend  This hotel was exactly what I had hoped for  It was centrally located in downtown Chicago directly across the street from the Grand Street EL station red line north  We purchased visitor passes and used the EL extensively  The desk staff was excellent They gave us  bottled waters and a great room with a view  When we mentioned that we had reservations at PF Changs restaurantat the end of the block they gave us coupons for a free appetizer  Whenever we asked for directions to a certain loaction the staff provided us a mapquest map to get to our destination  The price was excellent  All the rooms have a small fridge and microwave and there is access to a business center that has computer terminals and printers  I highly recommend this hotel as a GREAT place to stay in downtown Chicago  
P => Great Weekend Just returned from a long weekend with my husband at the Hilton Garden Inn  We had a wondeful time   the room was very clean location was great  The staff was very helpful in getting tickets for shows and navigating the trains Have stayed at the Westin and prefer this location better close walk to the mile and great restaurants  The red line and trolley to Navy Pier are just outside the front door  For the price you cant beat the service or location We cant wait to go back 
P => Super Our family stayed for one night as a family weekend get away  The location was great  With a stroller and two young children the location of the hotel made it easy to get around  The free trolley service it right across the street and dropped us off right at the door to Navy Pier and back again  We did use one of their free cribs and being very picky thought it was good enough for my baby although I did put my own sheet on it  We used the pool to entertain the kids it did have a strange smell but was clean and fun  The bath tub actually could be filled to bath the kids after the pool All of the staff was helpful and extremely nice  We are looking forward to staying here again  
P => Great location  Great price  Great service  I stayed on a Friday night for a short weekend visit  I paid  so didnt know what to expect  I was plesantly surprised  The staff was nice  The room was very nice with a good view of the city  The pool and hot tub were enjoyable  The only negative is the parking situation but that is true at almost all hotels in downtown Chicago  The location was close to everything  I would definitely stay at this hotel again over many more expensive places  
P => Great value and location Stayed in ust for two nights with my girlfriend to see some baseball games  This was our second visit to Chicago and since this place had received favorable reviews we gave it a shot turned out to be a great choice Location   Great area north of the river about  blocks west of Michigan Ave and next to State St  One HUGE bonus is the subway station right outside the door which came in handy for going to the baseball game  With the El a  minute walk to Michigan Ave and plenty of retail estabishments nearby a car is not needed  The area felt safe to walk in both day and night Room   This is an older tower hotel so the rooms are small as to be expected but adequate for  people  Air circulation was good and the bedding and furnishings were fine  Staff   Despite a late arrival our King NS Upper Floor was confirmed  The front desk staff guy was great pointed out Bijons American Bistro a couple of blocks away for a late night dinner  Also when we needed a bandaid instead of pointing us to a drugstore they just gave us some from their own cabinet  Housekeeping was efficient and the room was clean Amenities   A delicous breakfast was had at Webers  We did not go there for dinner or use poolgym  Lobby is rather small and except for a small nook with snackstoiletries there is not much else in the way of services  Webers is their only restaurant Price   rate through Hilton Website was  nt for a midweek stay  I am sure that a weekend rate is less and probably would include breakfast  As a HHonors member we got free bottled water which was nice in the warm weather  As I always say there is no reason NOT to use the Hilton website and sign up for HHonors the price is the same and the chances are much better that you wont get bumped or put in a crummy room if the place is full This is a great place to stay if you are looking for quality value and a good location  If you want more of a full service hotel with more luxuries then you  want one of the larger places directly on Michigan Ave  
P => Average hotel We picked the coldest weekend of this year to visit Chicago  Lucky us  My husband and I took our  year old to Chicago for some sightseeing and fun  His favorite part of the weekend was of course the pool  The pool was very small  Five families filled the pool and made it very crowded  The hot tub was very very hot  I enjoy hot tubs but this water was just too hot  I was scared for the small children who did go in it  Everyone you saw came out with very red skin  The location of this hotel is nice  Espn Zone is in its backyard which is nice for  year old boys  We had a nice time but the Hilton didnt overly thrill us  
P => This will be our Chicago home from now on     I took a girls trip with two friends  I am a Chicago native that wanted to show my Frisco friends what a great city Chicago is  From start to finish the Hilton was the BEST First after arriving at  am from Midway EL Orange line txf to Red line at Roosevelt to Grand stop   FYI   the EL drops you off RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel we thought wed drop off our luggage and shop until we could check in  pm  To our surprise and delight the desk said that our room was ready THEN As a Hilton Honors member we were also given vouchers for  bottles of water or one large and  to use towards their pantry snacks and stuff  Also included was breakfast for the  of us Weber Grill is inside the hotel  It included a continental at the Weber a Venti amp Pastry at the Starbucks also in the Hotel or for  more a Deluxe breakfast with made to order omelettes and pancakes  So off we went after a rest to see Chicago At  that eve we were looking for a restaurant for a late dinner and the desk had an extensive list with pricing and even called ahead to check on seating and hours  We had a wonderful meal GREAT STAFF AS WELL at the recommended Volare  E  Grand  The rooms were clean the staff was not just accomodating they went above and beyond too many times to mention here  STAY HERE   you wont regret it BTW  night at the Hilton website  
P => Great location great staff great price Great price consistently helpful friendly staff very clean and nice small touches everwhere  I had a corner room w two windows a microwave  refrigerator easy chair and a very nice closet and bathroom for  night  Of course it was ruary so I assume that price is seasonal  I would pay quite a bit more to stay there regardless  Near Nordstroms a small grocery store amp other retail that comes in handy  Also free use of Crunch gym almost next door as well as a nice hotel gym  The Weber Grill restaurant had a reasonably priced breakfast buffet with excellent service and nice quotto goquot options  A very well run hotel  I wish there were more like it  Will definitely stay there again  
P => Great hotel I stayed here between Christmas and New Years and the hotel staff was amazing  My frequent flier account wasnt attached to my HHonors account and the rep at check in insisted she take care of it and then followed up with a call saying it was done  The room was immaculate modern bed not the most comfyand the heating worked well  The fridge and microwave were very clean  Kudos to the business center they have a color printer available for guest use and the remote printing feature from your room is great and secure Location is great being next door to PF changs and a short walk to Nordstrom on Michigan Ave  
P => Excellent hotel  Great value for money Just wanted to follow up earlier reviews  This hotel has to be one of the best deals in town  I prepaid my stay through            and for just   tax got a great room  Like other reviewers with hhonors membership I was given a voucher for a more than adequate continental breakfast free vouchers for bottled water and other goods from the hour pantry  Service was excellent throughout  Location is pretty quiet for Chicago a reasonable walk to just about everything but with a red line subway station right outside the door  For me at least a much better choice than previous stays in and around the Loop  Overall highly recommended  
P => Very Nice Hotel at Reasonable Price Great Location  The service is always great at check in and check out  For the cost a great downtown MI AVE hotel  
P => Loved it I found out about this hotel via Tripadvisor and I can tell you the reviews were right on the money  The place is excellent very clean and the the service is impeccable  I think this hotel is one best places to stay in Chicago without spending a fortune  
P => Great place to stay I stayed here with my brother when we came over from the UK to see a Bears game  Its in a great location a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile Michigan Ave and within walking distance of The Loop  We even walked to Soldier Field and back but you might want to hop on a bus or the subway which has a stop almost right outside the door  The hotel was everything we hoped it would be   rooms were nice and clean and the staff were friendly  We had a great view of the John Hancock Center from our corner room other rooms have the possibility of views of the top of Sears Tower  The attached Webber Grill offered a breakfast buffet every morning for a reasonable price which was very convenient  Id definitely stay here again  
P => Far above the crowd I stayed at this hotel twice in ember   The front desk staff was very friendly and genuinely concerned with the quality of my hotel stay each time One clerk even said quotWelcome homequot Being a Hilton Gold member I was given a top floor room vouchers for breakfast Starbucks coupons bottled water coupon and a  coupon to the giftsnack shop  The room was nicely proportioned with a comfortable bed mini bar with a microwave and a desk with complementary Internet service  The bathroom was moderate in size very clean and well lit  Overall the hotel floor was quiet and orderly  I found a parking spot on the street so I didnt have to pay for parking after pm on Saturday the parking was free at the meters I found right across from the hotel entrance The breakfast vouchers were for continental breakfast at the Weber Grill but one can upgrade to a full breakfast for a dollar total   if paying without a voucher  I found the food and atmosphere to be appetizing and inviting  This is a steal in Chicago for an unlimited breakfast buffet  I must reiterate that the staff of this hotel make it stand far above its competitors  I have stayed at other hotels with more quotstarsquot but the HGI Chicago Downtown deserves more than   for the superior quotcan doquot attitude of its staff and its vast array of guest services  
P => Fantastic Great Location great views very quiet   the only inconvenience was the high cost for parking but its worth it  There is a grocery store right around the corner which helps since you have a microwave and fridge in your room  Not one major complaint about my stay which is rare  This is to use a phrase I saw earlier a hidden gem in the city  
P => A hidden treasure This hotel was wonderful and much more than I expected  Its new modern the furnishings in the room are new coffee maker and fridge in the room  The front desk employees were ready to help with directions and any way they could  The icing on the cake is the location Its close to everything  Right in the heart of shopping a couple blocks from North Michigan Avenue  A short walk to the stores on State and the theater district  Right around the corner from the hotel is a grocery store PerfectThe lobby has a modern minimal look  There is a high priced mini convienent store right off the front desk  A starbucks in the lobby with very pleasant employees  I won this hotel on Priceline its labeled as a   star  Its way better than that  Whether you win this hotel in a bid or purchase it you cant loose  The only negative was room service for breakfast  It was overpriced and horrible  Skip the room service and go to Starbucks in the lobby This is a hidden tresure in the city of Chicago  
P => Definitely stay again Superb location very nice room and friendly helpful staff  Had booked thru Priceline  per night  Arrived at am with the hope that I could leave my luggage and check in later   no problem my room was ready and also given free breakfast vouchers HH Gold  Late check out was no problem  I called as the free high speed internet would not connect in my room and within  minutes they rebooted the system and was working perfectly  Room was clean and ent size and bed was comfortable  Definitely stay again  
P => Very nice place to stay The Hilton Garden Inn is a nice place to stay  Great location with subway stop right in front of hotel  The room was clean and comfortable  One exception the dust ruffle on the bed was torn all the way around  Why that would be I dont know  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean  Room was a tad small but ok for us  The staff was exceptionally friendly  They moved us to a higher floor on check in when they heard that our relatives were up there  Housecleaning crew didnt clean our room till after  pm on Friday  There is no breakfast buffet but there is a corner bakery down the street with great breakfast choices  One suggestion you  want to choose another place to eat besides the hotels weber grill restaurant  Chicago has so many great places to eat  We didnt eat there but my relatives said the Weber grill is expensive and the food just ok  
P => Nice hotel excellent location We family of  stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Chicago for  nights  The desk staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean and we really appreciated the fridge and microwave in the room especially since there was a grocerydrug store right across State Street from the hotel This saved us quite a bit of money being able to eat breakfast and a light dinnersnack in the room I loved the location too  Theres a subway stop right outside the doorway of the hotel  We parked our car at the hotel night no in out privleges bought  day CTA visitor passes for  each and used combinations of subways els and buses to get around Chicago  Two nights we ate dinner at restaurants within walking distance of the hotel there are LOTS of restaurants nearby  We ate breakfast in our room  mornings but on Saturday morning we ate downstairs at the Weber Grill  They had an excellent and very reasonably priced breakfast buffet  I dont know if this buffet is available every morning or just on weekends I would definitely stay here again 
P => Love this hotel This is the second time I have stayed here and I was again very impressed The rooms are clean comfortable and good sized  Beds are very comfortable and I love having a large work desk fridge and microwave although having some eating utensils would be even better The Webber Grill downstairs and PF Changs supplying room service are also great as I was there on business alone and food is excellent  The bar is very friendly and having Starbucks morning coffee available in the lobby is spot on The pool is very small and workout area adequate but you can go next door to the quotCrunchquot Gym if so inclined The location of this hotel is second to none  Slap in the middle of town a block from Mich  Ave with everything else in walking distance  Staff are very friendly and helpful my only complaint is that the room service seemed very sparse on a Friday and my room still had not be cleaned by pm however this was the only time Would definitely recommend this hotel especially if you are a single female in town   I felt very safe  
P => MY KIND OF TOWN MY KIND OF HOTEL What a great hotel I do lare  The Hilton Garden Inn is ideally located right near State Street and about a three minute walk to Michigan Avenue  Youre steps from great shopping beautiful architecture and everything you could possibly want  I went with my newly appointed fiancee to celebrate our engagement  We took a cab to the hotel   it was about  on account of a lot of traffic  Next time I would definitely take the EL we took it going to Ohare upon departing Chicago and it was really easy  Check in to the hotel was quick and efficient  We had a corner room on the nd floor with a northern view out of one window and an eastern view out of the other   both of them of the Chicago skyline  Room was clean and beds were comfortable we opted for two queen beds because we are engaged not ried so I can assure you there was no hanky panky   just kidding we opted for the king and I can assure you the springs are broken  All in all it was a pleasant stay and there were zero problems  Other points worth noting The homeless in Chicago are very friendly  Rush Street has some great bars  For breakfast we walked along Rush heading north about  minutes to Einsetin Brothers Bagels worth the walk  Spend an afternoon at Navy Pier  Its beautiful there  Take the EL going back to Ohare or Midway   the hotel will give you directions and everybody takes it so you wont be alone  Be careful of Chicagos famous deep dish pizza  Youll get fat  
P => Definite Recommendation for Anyone Whether for business or pleasure I think this is a great hotel  I was staying there for a wedding a few weekends ago and had a blast Location It is very centrally located and the advantage it has from its rival hotels located on the Mag  Mile is that it is not crazy busy when you step out of the front door  The Mag  Mile is less than a  min  walk away  Several times when my wife and I went shopping we were able to run back to the Hilton and drop off our bags  We also had a couple of nice morning runs down to the Navy Pier and got to see the Air Show practice one of the mornings  Staff People were very helpful and willing to help  The young tall African gentleman at the door was helpful with my bags when I arrived and equally as helpful when we left  We mustve asked about  questions to the front desk on recommendations for late night barsclubseats and they accomodated each one  Rooms Room was very clean and we did enjoy having the mini fridge in the room w microwave for all of the left over food we had after eating outWe stayed in  second floor from the top and had a great view of the Chicago skyline including the John Hancock Tower I will post pics soon  I would definitely stay there again next time I go I just have to let my arteries clear of the stuffed pizza courtesy of Giordanos 
P => excellent hotel We stayed three nights after booking a good deal on the Hilton website  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly  We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room  The room was clean and comfortable  Ours was on the th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape  For the money it is a great hotel  Clean comfortable friendly affordable and in a good location  I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again We also took a tour wich they recommend us was great   We are planning another trip to chicago and we ll stay for sure at the hiltons 
P => Nice stay at the Hilton Garden We stayed three nights in early ust after booking a good deal on the Hilton website  We were able to walk to Michigan Ave  and the Art Institute without any difficulties  We found a shortcut through Nordstroms to Michigan  The store is very close to the hotel just walk through and you come right out on Michigan  It saves a little time and walking The staff was extremely helpful and friendly  We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room  There are two restaurants onsite Weber Grill and P F  Changs  Both will provide room service for a small fee  There is also a Starbucks kiosk in the lobby in the morning The room was clean and comfortable  Ours was on the th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape My only quotcomplaintquot The pool is nice but very small  The elevators can also be very slow at times Overall for the money it is a great hotel  Clean comfortable friendly affordable and in a good location  I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again  
P => Fantastic Staff My friends and I recently went on a two week holiday in the states and visited New York Vegas and finally Chicago where we stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn I had a mixed experience with the hotels in New York and Vegas however found the Hilton Garden Inn to be fantastic  The staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out  We stayed for three days and I was overwhelmed by the friendliess we recieved  The Webber Grill is a great restaurant with good old American sized porrtions and a large selection to choose from  Also the hotel bar had informal and friendly staff who were up for a lh and once again couldnt do enough to make us feel welcome The Hotel is located beside the magnificent mile and is therefore great for this who love to shop etc etc  Also there are plenty of bars  restaurants nearby for socialising and late night drinking I use Trip Advisor to help me book hotels and have never before written a review  I must say that the staff here were by far the best I have ever experienced  Everything from booking restaurants to recommending good nightlife to arranging travel to and from baseball games was all part of the service provided the guys at the Hilton Definitely recommend it if you want a centrally located Clean modern and friendly hotel experience in the heart of Chicago  
P => Great hotel great location I was very pleased with this hotel from the moment I walked through the doors  Every hotel employee was very friendly and the service was very good  The room was large very clean and well appointed  There was a refrigerator microwave and free high speed internet access  The blanket was sandwiched between two sets of sheet which was a nice touch  Also while the hotel was full I found that at most I had to wait a minute for one of the elevators a fact I really appreciated  The location is excellent   within two blocks of the magnificent mile half mile from navy pier mile from the Art Institute near public transportation and surrounded by restaurants  The area also felt very safe even late at night  The only area that could use minor improvements was house keeping  The last afternoon I was there I was changing to go out aroud  and house keeping walked in without knocking as they had left some cleaning supplies in the room  They were very apologetic and mentioned that they would be right back with clean towels  When I returned at  there were still no towels and it dawned on me that there had been no new towels the evening before we had had extras in the room and used them  I called the front desk   they were very apologetic said they had had a problems with the linen service and that they would be right up with them  A colleague also had the same problem and found it necessary to call the desk  On a minor note I had made coffee the first morning and it wasnt replaced until the th day and the sugar and stirrers were not replaced  If not for these house keeping issues I would have rated this hotel with five stars  
P => Great hotel downtown Stayed there    Location is excellent and close to Mag  Mile and Museum Art Institute Aquarium and Planetarium  All are within walking distanceThe staff was very accomodating and allowed us to check in early and leave our luggage on check out to do some shopping The breakfast buffet was terrific but could use more fresh fruits  The only mild downer was the in room air conditioner which was occasionally noisy at night Would definitely stay there again and Id give it a solid    stars Galoha 
P => Great Stay Great hotel The rooms are very clean and the bathroom is totally up to date  No problems with the plumbing etc  No bugs either  The staff is very nice also  The Webber Grill is pretty pricey but there are plenty of other places around there to eat at  I definitely would stay there again 
P => Good central location This hotel is great if you need a cheaper option that is centrally located  The beds are nothing to write home about but the room is clean and the front desk is extremely helpful  The location cannot be beat   its close to everything  I have also stayed at the Talbot and I definitely would rather be here  The service and location is better  They accomodated my every request  It is not a romantic hotel in style but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it  
P => Great hotel  Loved it and would return Great value and centrally located for restaurants  Stayed here  nights after Easter  Saved  per night with Honors Membership  Youll get a free pass to Crunch which is a very nice private fitness club  Lobby connects to Webers Grill which has great food  Michigan Ave is only a few blocks away  Had more fun shopping at the smaller shops on the side streets  
P => What a great place to stay My husband son  dhter  and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for three nights in ch   What a great experience we had The room was clean the staff was extremely friendly and the location couldnt be beat  We got the internet rate of  which was a deal  It was great having a small refrigerator in the room for drinks microwave too although we didnt use it   Theres a great grocery store just across the street  The kids enjoyed swimming in the indoor pool  despite its small size it was perfect for them  We ate dinner at the Weber Grill and it was teriffic  Not one complaint about this hotel I would highly recommend it to anyone 
P => Wonderful stay We just returned from a  night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Chicago  It was fantastic  The staff was wonderful from the moment we checked in until we left   this included the valet at the door the porter the front desk staff and the maids  Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home  The room was average size and very clean  We were in room  on the Hilton Honors floor the hotel has  floors  Our room was far from the elevator and very quiet  We had a view of the Sears Tower   which our boys loved  Our  and  year old boys swam in the pool indoors  The pool is a quotplayquotpool and only  feet deep and not huge  It was never crowded and they had a great time  The spa held  people max  Although not used the workout room looked nice  We opted for self park since we knew we wouldnt be using our car  this is  per hrs and does NOT offer inout privlages  The valet parking has unlimited inout privlages and is day  We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again  
P => Great Weekend At The Hilton Garden Inn Just spent a super three  day weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn  Got a great rate of   from the Hilton web site  Not super fancy but very clean new appearance  Staff were all very helpful and pleasant  Did breakfast each morning at The Webber Grill  Great location  Lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance  Took the free trolley to Navy Pier  This DuPage County kid and friends are already planning our next get away to Chicago and will definitely stay here again  
P => Satisfactory stay My wife and I stayed at the Hilton right before Thanksgiving in   Average hotel but we werent at the hotel very much at all  Good location and Weber Grill Restaurant in lobby is very good  Our rate was  
P => Great service great value We stayed at the this hotel for three nights last week and were really impressed  For the money  Hilton website this hotel is a real value for its excellent location  The staff was consistently helpful and friendly  Excellent management  
P => Very pleasant hotel great value and great location I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for  days after Christmas  I got a fabulous deal less than  night tax included  It was clean quiet a good size and a fabulous location  While it is not the height of luxury it is comfortable and the surroundings are very pleasant  I literally could find no fault with the hotel  I would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago  
P => regal hotel The Hilton is a regal grand hotel  We stayed on the excutive floor  The room was a little small but a nice view of the park at a resonable price  Some freebees are the beautiful Botanical Gardens Lincoln Park Zoo and Buckingham Fountain  Downtown offers an array of dinning  We ate at Fridays which was within walking distance to our hotel  Navy Pier is a must but youll want to find parking on the street  Second City is great for lhs at a reasonable price  The Shed Aquarium although a little pricey is a Must see  For those romatics take a carriage ride around the city for about   There are lots of other great musems to visit too  
P => Very Enjoyable Stay Have just returned from a  night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and will definately be staying here again The location was superb   blocks from Michigan Avenue and surrounded by a large range of restaurants and shops  The staff were extremely pleasant and friendly at all times and the whole hotel seems brand new and clean  The free internet access from all rooms is a huge bonusas is the fridge in the room  The only small problem we had was that you had to run the hot tap for about  minutes until the hot water came for the shower But I think this was more to do with the location of our room at the end of a long corridor with no adjoining rooms Id highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a Chicago break and Im usually a very fussy hotel guest 
P => Very comfortable Though this place doesnt have the charm of some of the older hotels in Chicago it is very clean and comfortable  The best part is the pool on the th floor  If there arent a bunch of frat boys in the hot tub you might actually get a chance to relax and gaze out the fully windowed walls for the great view  We paid  for the room  double beds but I wouldnt go much more than that  Not that its not nice but you can get a room in the Knickerbocker for that much  This just feels like most other Holiday Inn type places  
P => If you get a good rate this hotel is hard to beat I stayed at this property      The hotel was very nice and very clean  The Weber grill downstairs has a great breakfast menu and a good atmosphere at night  The location is perfect   a block from ESPNZONE Hard Rock Cafe Rain Forest Cafe Michigan Ave  My room was on the th floor and had a great view if the Sears Tower  I booked the room through Hiltons website and received a rate of  per night  I will stay at this property next time I am in CHI TOWN    
P => Would definitely stay here again We stayed here for  nights in y  The room was very clean spacious and had an amazing view  The staff were friendly and very helpful we were shown to our room by a member of staff to check that we thought there was enough room for the rollaway beds that we required  There was plenty of room for the rollaway beds and they were brought up straight away  There was free internet access a small pool hot pool and small gym all of which we made good use of  The hotel is in a great location right outside of the El  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Hotel Fabulous Staff We enjoyed our four day stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  The room was neat and provided a lot of extras including microwave refrigeratoretc   for a reasonable price compared to other hotels  A wonderful location located a block away from Michigan Avenue without the noise  The continental breakfast that we paid for extra was worth it and having Starbucks in the hotel was also nice  The staff was excellent and if you want to make reservations have them do it  they will get you in We will stay there again on our next visit  
P => Great Stay at the Hilton Garden Very pleased with our three day stay at Hilton Garden  Staff extremely courteous check in took less than a minute  Both the room and bathroom were very clean  Room was not huge just nice size with king bed work table sofa chair and ottoman  Room was quiet only occasionally disturbed by noisy people in hallway and passing fire truck  floors down  Location is hard to beat two blocks from Michigan Ave  Tons of good restaurants within a few blocks not to mention the Weber Grill in the same building  Only minor complaint would be noisy fridge but turning the fridge down from max to medium setting took care of the issue  Since I would not rate this hotel as quotluxuryquot I would have hard time paying the  flat rate per night  If you can get the room at a discount like I did its defintely the top choice  Valet parking a little pricey if you are staying more than two nights you can save a few bucks with self park  
P => great staff We stayed at this hotel with two small children while my husband was in town for a trade show  Weve stayed at many downtown hotels and I have to say that Ive never experienced such a wonderful staff The valet guys the bellmen the front desk and even housekeeping were not only helpful in every way but went out of their way to be friendly and available  They treated our children like honored guests The hotel is clean new and updated and has a good location   but the staff is what makes it an excellent choice  
P => Excellent hotel This place is what you should expect in a hotel  Great service great rooms great amenities and great location  I stayed here for a trade show for two nights and was extremely pleased my entire trip  The location is walking distance or a  cab ride to anywhere downtown  Feel free to ask any employee anything about the city or the hotel because they all seemed competent as well as eager to help  
P => Two Thumbs Up    WAY Up We can t wait to return to Chicago and this hotel  A nice hotel in a great location  Clean and comfortable  Starbucks coffee available in the lobby  Awesome shopping all around and a wonderful restaurant downstairs and numerous restaurants nearby  The hotel amenities are great and the staff are all very friendly and helpful  An overall GREAT value  We definitely recommend it 
P => My choice for Chicago Some friends and I went to Chicago last month  We knew we wanted to be near Michigan Avenue so we chose the Hilton Garden Inn  A bargain at  a night whereas most of the other hotels we saw were much more expensive  It turned out to be great  The room is nothing fancy but certainly nice and it was very clean microwave in room is a nice extra  However the drawing card is the location  It cant be beat  Within walking distance are many shops restaurants pubs a blues bar and a piano bar  We were all very pleased with our choice and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great place to stay without breaking the bank  
P => very nice hotel I stayed in this hotel for  days in the first week of y  The hotel is very well located  minutes and you are on the magnificent mile  The rooms are neat clean nicely furnished  The front desk staff is really nice and helpful  Hotel is surrounded by restaurants malls     There is a superket in front of the hotel and you can buy all you need  There is a fridge in the room and a microwave always helpful  I tried their restaurant Webber Grill and it was really good food their black and blue burger is awesome    Starbucks is open in the lobby    great for morning coffee on the go   I will definitely stay there next time I am in Chicago  
P => Wonderful stay My wife  year old son and I stayed here  through e   The valetsbellmen at the frontdoor greeted us pleasantly as we walked up took the subway from the airport  Receptionwas friendly and efficient  Room was spaciousand very clean  Microwave and fridge were veryhandy since there is a great superket acrossthe street that is open til midnight  Starbucks block away  Nice workout room w smallpool  Free high speed internet worked great Approx  a  block walk over to Michigan Ave where all the high end stores reside  Easybus andor subway ride to everything  We chtBlue Man Group after a short subway ride Loved the fresh flowers in the lobby  Highlyrecommended especially for the price  
P => Great Hotel value for location service and ammenities  
P => Satisfied   definitely staying here next time too  
P => Great location concierge service lacking but makes up for it  
P => Nice little hotel   
P => Excellent suites  
P => Great Deal   
P => Garden Inn is Great  
P => Great Place  
P => Etwas lautes aber komfortables Hotel gut gelegen   
P => Tr s bien  
P => 
P => Terrific Stay From start to finish the staff was very friendly and willing to offer assistance  Rooms very clean  It was just my husband and I so the suite was perfect  It  be small for a larger family  Did not use the pull out couchbed so not sure how comfortable this would be  The bed and furnishings were very nice  Bar and restaurant was expensive other good values in the area  Walking distance to all the fine shopping and located right next to the John Hancock Building and a couple of blocks to the Towers Shopping and American Girl Store  Located just  block off of Michigan Ave which was perfect and only a few blocks from the Lake  Great to walk either direction from the hotel  
P => Anyone gives this place above an average rating is crazy What a disappointment  The ONLY thing this place has going for it is location  Dont look for anything else quotspecialquot about this hotel  A real disappointment Look at the negatives in the other reviews  And consider them strongly  Very strongly  The people who wrote the negatives about this place in other reviews know EXACTLY what they are talking about We would not consider returning to this place even if the rate was night  Thats how disappointing it is  There are too many other places in the neighborhood that offer the benefits of a great location but offer accomodations and service that are just so far superior to this one Oh and by the way   the beds are extremely uncomfortable  The fold out couch is a definite joke as others have said  But the beds themselves Awful  
P => Best Value Biggest Room Best experience So weve been in and out of hotel rooms for the past month after being in between apartments on my part and this is the best one thus far   hilton   doubletree LAST   allegro  The room is absolutely huge   double doors that lead to a giant bedroom with another tv a living room with a flat panel big bathroom wet bar   not to mention the ridiculously cool indoor pool on the roof   Do you know how rare that is Doubletree advertised a roof   that was closed for the winter  And the couch folds out into a bigger bed  And theres a microwave And its right next to the Hancock building giving us a gorgeous view the fact that they put us on the top floor didnt hurt either  We were planning on going out and enjoying the city but got such a kick out of our room that we went to Jewel like  teenagers and bought  worth of frozen buffalo wings to eatwatch tv with all night while snuggling on our folding couch I cant believe this was the cheapest hotel we got because this was BY FAR the best Ive ever stayed in  I wish I can get the same rate again but its just not showing up   
P => Lovely Hotel Perfect location When visiting Chicago we love to stay on or near the Magnificent Mile for shopping restaurants etc This hotel is lovely newly reated  The rooms are clean spacious suites with internet service  We were well cared for by staff and enjoyed the little restaurant for a quick snack or drink  Walking distance to most things or a cab ride or bus ride to all else  
P => Not Hilton level no safe in room ridiculus breakfast touristic hotel too expansive Very very far from Hilton level a touristic hotel with a very very poor breakfast  omelettes pastries waffels available as extra   At the same price   leveled at minimum around   per night in addition  for parking while others are     you  find others much better same block  The room is very large is a ior suite with a plasma but the bedroom has just an old style tv channels in total internet not free business center not free  computers in total swipe your credit card also for turning on the pc  no ipod console in room minibar in room present but empty NO SAFE IN ROOM no fan in bathroom with  doors to access it  for bedroom  for living room single sink    Much better  door to the bathroom and  silks or not Good a sink in the living room and a microwave   It is understood that this hotel was a DoubleTree before and not originally a Hilton     Look deeply before choosing this hotel same block there or  block far you  find   superhotel knickerbocker riot     For same price you get a sqf suite at knickerboker with jacuzzi fully stocked minibar xquot plasma Frette linen and bathrobe and slippers   Very very poor for a Hilton  
P => Lovely stay  Cant wait to return  My girlfriends and I stayed at the Hilton Suites Magnificent Mile for  nights in ust   I requested an upgrade at the front desk and was told that we had been given one only to discover that the room was the exact one that we had paid for  Oh well  It was worth a shot  We had an alcove room which was clean and modern  The flat screen tv that you could swivel at any angle was a very nice touch  There is a microwave but no refrigerator a little strange  Our room had two double beds and a small pull out sofa  The beds are double not queen which was a very tight fit for two friends sharing a bed  Any request that we made was immediately taken care of  The front desk staff maintenance and housekeeping were all very nice and helpful  Concierge never seemed to be at the desk  We tried repeatedly but never found anyone at this post  Very annoying since all maps and brouchures were located behind the concierges desk  Parking was very expensive  per day valet but you can come and go as often as you like for that price  Hotel is very close to wonderful shopping and dining  Most attractions required a short cab ride average was about  including tip  I would definitely recommend this hotel and cant wait to return  Very nice stay  Be sure to get Second City tickets while in Chicago  The show was a hightlight of this trip  Non stop lhs  
P => Great location lots of room  We travelled to chicago with our two teenaged boys  This hotel was great because of the space  We had a suite with a bedroom and living room  The space was nice and clean  The beds were comfortable although it would have been nice if they had been queen size rather than fulldouble  Of course in Chicago you have to pay for everything including parking night and wireless internet  Free wifi was available in the lobby but you had to pay for it if you wanted it in your room  We got a ent price for our room night on Expedia  The hotel was within walking distance of the Navy Pier river cruise and the red line trainEl  All in all I would say this was a good place to stay especially if youre travelling with kids  
P => Return Family Great Location Good facilities a little tired I stayed at this property for  nights in il  with my  children and had a good experience  So when we were coming to Chicago this year it was my first choice  The rooms are big for a family of  traveling with lots of luggage  We stayed  nights this year  The kids are   and  We were meeting various family members at this property and even more family members from Chicago  The concierge was very helpful in recommending some brunch and dinner locations for a party   Our wait times were minimal   Thank youWe arrived after a  hr flight from London  From the time we arrived the entire hotel staff was very friendly  Check in was smooth  For the st nights we had  joining rooms K suite to double alcove  This gave us lots of space to help adjust to jet leg  The rooms were clean and in good repair  For the   nights I asked to be moved to a double suited room my husband left on a business trip so we didnt need the extra space  The nd room could have used a bit of maintenance work   the ceiling was coming down in the corner due to upstairs water damage  Maintenance had to come in and fix the sofa sleeper  All the rooms were clean but the hotel could use a bit of a maintenance update The first morning we arrived the family was wide awake at a and at the pool by a   it was fantastic to let the kids wiggle without disturbing the other guests  note   the pool is definitely a childfamily pool and the whole pool area needs to be reated We are Gold Honors guests so we were given the option of free internet   off breakfast buffet or free continental breakfast or points  We chose the breakfast coupons  The hotel breakfast was typical hotel food   the hot food looked a little old but the cold stuff was fresher  We ate out at  local diners for breakfast as my brothers family were not Gold guests There are several good breakfast options within a  block walk   the concierge has a list of local restaurants  We went to Tempo Diner and Orginal Pancake House I found the hotel bar to be expensive for single glasses of wine and chose to buy a bottle across the street at the mini ket and kept it in the room fridge The property is located close to shopping and North Street beach The children had a fantastic time  The girls especially loved the proximity to the American Girl Store There is a great steakhouse around the corner   Rosebuds Steakhouse  The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the  children  We went there the first night in town and the children all fell asleep on the booth  We returned several nights later with  children and had great servicefood againAs a family we would return to this proprty again  
P => great location with a pool The hotel property was OK  The toilet ran no bathroom fan and no clock when we first got into our room  The staff was very helpful  The location is great  Overall a good choice if youre traveling with kids who need a pool  
P => Great family place We visit Chicago frequently but this was our first stay at the Hilton  The rooms were large and clean and the location is terrific  There is a small fridge a microwave and coffeemaker  The beds were very comfortable and having a arate bedroom was great  The bathroom was also large clean and stocked with Crabtree amp Evelyn products  The pool was also lovely with warm water and a great view of the lake  The restaurant was very good but a little pricey even for Chicago  All of the staff members were very friendly and helpful  For the  parking fee you get in and out privledges but there is a lot closeby for dayand another two blocks south on Delaware for day  
P => Great Hotel and Wonderful Staff I stayed only one night at this wonderful hotel  From the first moment of my arrival I felt welcomed by the doorman and reception desk  Room was large and immaculate loved it The lady at the snack bar downstairs was wonderful and helpful and made me feel a stranger no more  Even my mini horse Traveller aka The Traveling Man would approve and give  hoofs up 
P => Great location wonderful rooms Had a great stay at the Hilton Suites  Wonderful large rooms  Had breakfast and dinner at the resturant which was excellent  The pool also looked nice was filled with kids and families  
P => A great experience A very pleasant stay for two nights y rd and the th  We were able to close our bedroom door so I never heard the usual hall noise of every other hotel I have stayed at in my life  The check in person was very helpful The rest of the staff were okay  
P => Not worth it Can find better Chicago hotels This hotel is okay but not worth the amount you pay even for downtown Chicago  It appears old run down and out dated inside  The rooms also seem old and are  very  small again even for downtown Chicago  None of the staff are very friendly  We also listened to housekeeping staff being extremely loud lhing and talking about personal matters every morning in our hallway  Very unprofessional  Most Chicago hotels are better than this one  
P => No doutb  first choice for me Nice clean spacious luxurious  Hope to move on one day to one of this rooms I really loved to stay here and will stay every time i have a conference here Good location to the shopping malls and great view across  The overall service was perfect and the price was great as we booked through the net  I will recommend you every person who is coming by   RegardsPaul 
P => Would stay here again in a minute The staff was all very friendly even with the small kids and knowledgable about local attractions  Rooms were nice and requests for a high floor were honored  Definately would recommend to others as a fine place to stay in Chicago  
P => Fun Hotel in the Middle of It All My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Suites on the latter part of our Chicago honeymoon  We checked in on a Sunday after a mile walk from our previous hotel on the river  Walking in was impressive  I did not realize when I booked on Priceline how great the location was  The block that the hotel was on is in a little quieter neighborhood but so close to Michigan Avenue and everything else One thing I want to emphasize is USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET HERE  I have heard that parking is outrageously priced and thankfully we had a limo drive us in and we are taking the train to our car in the suburbs  much more economical The lobby is beautiful  We were kindly greeted by the staff who promptly and politely gave us our room keys and up the elevators we went  The elevators are efficient and quick and there seems to always have been an elevator waiting in the lobby  The pool and workout room on the th floor are a nice side attraction especially if a guest were to have kids When we came to our room at first however we found it to still be occupied at p How embarrassing Apparently they had not checked out when they were supposed to but still  I think there should have been better communication between the cleaning maids and the front desk on that one  The issue was quickly resolved and we were given a new room It kind of stinks that you have to pay for internet which I refused since there was a weak network I could connect to from elsewhere  Other than that our room was kept clean there were always friendly greeters at the front and we had an overall comfortable stay in a beautiful city  
P => A Great Location This all suites hotel is on East Delaware Street just across from the John Hancock tower  You are close to great shopping on the  block of Michigan Avenue  The cheesecake factory the museum of contemporary art amp the double ker trolley route are all close by  I was able to get it for night on priceline Parking was another  for inout privelages  Cheaper lots across the way at the Hancock  
P => Great location value and rooms I would stay here again this hotel was great  we booked the room for  on Priceline   stars   blew away our expectations 
P => Luvly Jubly Great stay My wife and  teenage kids were heading back home from Cleveland to Milwaukee and ided to spend a couple days in Chicago for some sightseeing  This was a great location right at the North end of Michigan Ave with a great rate  All the hotels in the area have to charge alot for parking but we parked in a garage right around the corner for   for a  hour period   better than the   the hotel wouldve charged  Also be aware that many hotels with indoor pools like this one will charge for quotathletic club feesquot or something along these lines  This hotels pool sauna whirlpool and machines are included in the very affordable price  American Doll store is within  blocks and all the shops are right at your doorstep  Took a bus to Lincoln Park Zoo free and walked to the south end of michigan Ave and took a free shuttle bus to Navy Pier  In the evening I walked  blocks to Rush St  for Live Jazz and drinks while the  girls watched a movie and went to bed  Cant beat it 
P => Great bang for your buck right in the heart of Magnificent Mile Stayed  nights for business the location is great its right off Michigan behind the John Hancock Tower and Water Tower Shops  Big suite flat screen TV that wasnt as clear as it should be sofabed in living room nice sized bathroom drain was rather slow to clear in the shower but otherwise fine  Overall given the low rate I got it was a tremendous value  Nice rooftop indoor poolhealth center too  Would suggest going around the corner to The Saloon Steakhouse for dinner its a gem My biggest complaint with Hilton is they charge  day for in room internet access yet their Hampton Inn brand gives it to you free come on Hilton at least give your HHonors members a break 
P =>  from Priceline but  for parking Does this seem a little strange Room was very nice and the  winning bid on Priceline was reasonable but I have never paid  for parking and I stay at various hotels in downtown Chicago often  
P => Great Rooms the room we had was great  a arate living area and a arate bedroom  very comfortable bed  frigde and microwave included in quotsuitequot  location was on the magnificant mile so close to shopping  nothing special about the attendants at the front desk  no welcomes or smiles they just check you in quickly  internet is not free in the room but it is when youre in the lobby  the worst part about this place is the parking  it cost  per night to valet park no self parking available  we did manage to park at a parking structure minutes away for  dollars for a hour period although the sign said  for hours  we got a really good deal for the hotel on priceline com lt a night  
P => Great location beautiful views   highly recommend We stayed here for one night at the end of a week long business trip to Central Illinois  The room rate was cheaper than near the airport so we thought wed have some fun our last night  And the Hilton Suites didnt disappointThe staff was wonderful   starting with the valet attendants  Yes parking is  but its that much everywhere in Chicago or most major cities  The front desk staff was most helpful and freindly  The suite was on the th floor and had a nice view of Lake Michigan  There was an LCD TV in the living room area and an older TV in the bedroom  The rooms have been recently updated as everything was nice and new The pool and exercise room are on the top floor th with a gorgeous view The restaurant was great for breakfast  The continental breakfast for Diamond members was rather sparse but we could apply the voucher towards a full breakfast which was delicious The location is great  We parked the car and didnt need it again  Its a one block walk to Michigan Avenue with lots of shops and restaurants right there This is a great place to stay in the Magnificent Mile at a reasonable price  
P => Absolutely loved it First time staying at the Hilton   have stayed at several others in Chicago From the moment we arrived and were met by a smile and welcome from the desk  The suites are more than adequate with microwave and fridge and coffee machine  The beds are really comfortable and there is a normal TV in the bedroom with a large flat screen in the living area  Bathroom was larger than average with very hot water at any time of day and excellent pressure to the shower  An abundance of towels is always available The swimming pool  hot tub and sauna are located on the th floor together with the fitness room with amazing views over the lake  There are always cabs outside waiting to take you wherever but the hotel is only one block from the shops and Michigan Avenue so ideally located for shopping etc and right behind the Hancock  
P => Great surprise Havent stayed here since it was the Doubletree a couple years ago  It was a little shabby then but I was very pleased with the room  Totally redone  room suite  Two plasma TVs microwave small fridge  Although I dont know why they put the microwave under the cabinet and way down low  Coffee maker with Lavazza coffee  Great workout room on the top floor with indoor pool spa and great views  Very close to water Tower and Mag Mile  
P => Good location and service Stayed for  nights while attending a conference  The hotel is well located for the Magnificent Mile just around the corner from the Millenium Knickerbocker Westin and Drake hotels The hotel is clean the lobby is spacious with free WiFi  The pool is up on the higher floors with a view of the Lake The room was good though not amazing  The bedding and linen though was fantastic  The suites are spacious and you can split the room into two and use the sofa bed as an alternative bed i sharing with non spouse we were in a two doubles room  The bathroom is reasonable with a good amount of towels  There is a small sink and coffee machine in the lounge area which is helpful  WiFi and wired internet in the rooms costs money Staff were excellent and very helpful Note that the Magnificent Mile is good for some things but its not quite the busy night bustle of downtown so you might find that you trek down there every day  Food specifically was a concern with mainly high end restaurants near the hotel  It was a good walk to the nearest cheap food joint Overall happy with the stay  
P => Fantastic Hotel Amazing Experience I had a terrible flight before I got to the property so I was very grouchy When I arrived there was a very nice gentleman there to open the door for me with a big smile  I feel smiles change everything  When I got to the front desk there was a bit of a line and I was already tired so it made me a little grumpy but that is just how it goes  When I got to the desk the young lady was very very nice she welcomed me to the property with another smile  The suite was very nice for the price  It has a flat screen tv in the living room and and a regular television in the bedroom  The beds are very comfortable  So my day was going a little better I have had some very bad hotel stays so I was happy so far  When I opened my suitcase I realised I had forgotten my toiletries  I called down to the front desk and they had replacements sent up with in  minutes  During my stay everyone was very helpful and cheerful really living up to the hilton standard  When checking out there where a few things on my bill that where incorrect but the gentleman at the desk had no problem taking care of them for me  He asked me how my stay was and was sure to welcome me back  I am going to recommend this hotel to all of my friends visiting Chicago  
P => Great place to stay Stayed here for  weeks and had a great time  Rooms are spacious air con kept rooms nice ncool and beds were excellent  Great location and we found all the staff very helpful  Only minor gripe was housekeeping waking us up for something we didnt request  Note only rooms with single king are on lake side we have  doubles which meant city side  We didnt have breakfast there and instead went to Tempo UK tourist note food good but doesnt take cards so dollars go quickly Corner bakery Cedar and State excellent foodvalue or LAppetitto Hancock building  Given length of stay we found hotel to be excellent and would definitely stay again  
P => All show and no substance The room is ent and reasonably comfortable  That is about all the complementary statements I can make  Expect no service because you will get what you expect  When they say check in is at  pm dont expect it a minute early  Dont store your bags with the bellman because you never know when you will see them again Dont ask for turn down service because that wont happen and dont ask for any special compensation because that wont happen If you need a room and nothing else this hotel is acceptable  Otherwise stay elsewhere  
P => Great location horrible service We booked a weekend at the Hilton Suites for a girls weekend getaway and had many many issues with poor service at this location  Our rooms were given away with little explanation or apology and we were offered sub standard rooms only  On Saturday we were promised a move to our originally reserved rooms by  p m  which did not happen  The entire time the front desk staff was incredibly grouchy and did not apologize or attempt to make amends  We had other issues with our bill and key cards  The hotel itself is nice as long as you dont interact with anyone who works there I will never stay at this hotel again as there are a plethora of other options nearby namely a Residence Inn across the street  
P => Beware The Alcove In uary I booked two rooms one for us and one for relatives with two small children at this hotel for the long y th weekend  In booking the toll free number reservation clerk asked if I wanted the alcove suite  I asked what it was  She stated that the alcove suite was in the corner configured differently like an  L  so the bedroom was still arate but the price was the same as for the regular suite  I said yes and booked two alcoves on different floors both room numbers ended in     Then I arrived at one of the busiest weekends of the Chicago year where the room you booked was the room you got Beware   contrary to the website   the  alcove  is not a suite  It does not have a arate bedroom   it is one big square room  It does not have two TVs  It does not have a mini refrigerator for the soda water and left over cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory  It does not have a microwave to heat up leftover Gino s pizza  It has one small coffee maker and that s it  The advertising from Hilton on its website on this type of room is totally misleading  I did not mind the lack of a arate bedroom as much as the fact that it didn t have a mini frig or microwave  The fact that it doesn t have a arate bedroom mini frig microwave etc  should be accurately advertised by Hilton on its website because it matters to some people   especially those with children  I also don t see how or why Hilton charges the same per night for an alcove room as it does for a  true  suite The room itself was comfortable I had a sideways view of the lake and the two kids absolutely loved the pool but I am surprised at and disappointed in the Hilton which is a quality company to advertise the alcove as something it was not  
P => Simply Delightful  Enough Said  From top to bottom we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  The staff was attentive efficient and friendly  Our room was absolutely lovely     better than expected  We only had a short stay and would have loved to have extended it but unfortunately we did not pack accordingly The room had a comfortable sitting area with a desk facing Oak Street Beach a flat screen TV and a convenient wet bar microwave and mini refrigerator all nicely concealed in beautiful cabinets The bathroom was quite spacious and tastefully orated  It was accessible from both the sitting area and the master bedroom  Between the master bedroom and bathroom was a nice vanity area The master bedroom was also tastefully orated with a very comfortable bed and a view of the lake  The bedding was top notch and what you would expect of nicer hotels  The hotel was very quiet so you could really get a good nights sleep We took advantage of the complimentary breakfest and was pleasantly surprised at the wide offerings the helpful staff and the views of city life bustling outside the window  They also had an outdoor cafe All in all if youre popping into the city for a short stay or long I think youll enjoy the staff accommodations and locations of this gem  A great value for the money  
P => A New Favorite Place to Stay Our family travels to Chicago once or twice every year and we have stayed at various properties throughout the city and suburbs  Some have been so so while others have been great  Our most recent stay over Memorial Day weekend was at the Hilton Suites MM  Our experience here was terrific and very family friendly  This hotel had an amazing location  an easy walk or catch a short cab ride to everything the Watertower Shopping Mall is about a block away The suite was generous in size  the bathroom was one of the biggest Ive seen in a standard room  and it was very clean  The beds were also quite comfortable  The first morning we went to the restaurant in the hotel Mrs  Parks Tavern and were pleasantly surprised how good the food was  We returned for breakfast two day later The staff was also very friendly and helpful  It was one of our best visits to Chicago and I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Very nice This hotel has a great location in Streeterville right next to the John Hancock tower  if you want to see Chicagos main attractions without renting a car this is a good spot  We had a lake view suite and with our AAA rate it was a good buy the suite really felt like a small apartment with a great bed flat screen tv in the living roomden  The hotel restaurant was nice the only complaint would be that the bar had no draft beer for the entire weekend we were there  they seemed to indicate that it would be fixed any time but it didnt seem to be much of a priority Overall very nice and I would definitely stay there again  
P => Great Hotel  Great Location  Great staff  First of all you cant beat the location  Its in the perfect spot on the Magnificent Mile and very close the lake  John Hancock tower is across the street and worth a visit  The hotel is on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle which made it feel more like a local boutique hotel rather than a busy and noisy mega hotel  The front desk staff was overly helpful and when I told the clerk I was craving clam chowder he proceeded to call all the local restaurants until he found one serving clam chowder I was impressed The rooms are top notch and super clean  Maid service was superb and the common areas were all very clean and nicely appointed  I loved the top floor pool with the breathtaking view of the lake  One person complained about the trash can being in the wrong place and said they wouldnt recommend the hotel   well I think that says it all when all you can find wrong with this hotel is a mis located trash can  Its a great place to stay    period  
P => I always love to come back I often stay at the Hilton suites The only negative thing is that its Hilton suites before the reation it was a Doubletree hotel and now you get no more cookiesLocationJust  minutes away from Michigan Avenue  The Hancok Center ist just around the corner StaffThe staff is always helpfull and friendly  RoomsNewly reated  The beds are very comfortable  There is a erate Living room  There are  tv s and one of them is a flat screen  Everything is brand new  The bath is big and very nice orated Overall beautiful clean and comfortable rooms and what I love The windows can be openedThere is a snack bar in the lobby where they brew Starbucks The fitness room is small but the view from there is fantastic Cant tell the price cause my company pays A great place to stay for vacation or business 
P => Was better as a Doubletree We stayed here when it was a Doubletree in  and it was so much better  This time the round table and  chairs were missing However the livingdining area is the same size so there is a quite large area that is just empty  There is a couch to sit on as there was when it was a Doubletree but if more than one person wants to eat or write or just sit at a table forget about it  There is only a desk that seats one person  The metal waste basket in the bathroom made a perfectly HUGE bang in the middle of the night when you walked into it because there is no place under the vanity for this bin made out of a ridiculous material  There is no shaving or make up mirror of any kind with ent light  Tea coffee and a percolator are provided but if you want to add sugar andor milk and stir it youll have to use your finger or something else since no stirrers or spoons are provided  The pull out couch has a bar that perfectly pierces your back  All in all a pretty terrible experience  Next time I will check out the riott across the street  
P => Excellent Option in the Magnificent Mile area Stayed for one night at the Hilton Suites located adjacent to the John Hancock building and just one block off the Magnificant Mile  Perfect location for doing business or entertaining in Chicago The lobby is not grand but has a small coffee shop and bar  restaurant out front  Did not eat at either place but they looked ent  There is also a small convenience store right across the street if you are looking for some quick snacks  The entire hotel looks brand new and is extremely clean and polished  The staff seems to work hard to keep it up The rooms are fabulous  Two room suites with a living room amp bedroom and large bathroom  Again the rooms look brand new were perfectly clean the bed was comfortable typical Hilton and all the amenties you would need  There is an HD TV in the living room area but I could not find any HD channels  be that is coming Plenty of good restaurants in the area  We ate at Mike Ditkas restaurant and he actually came in and ate a few tables from us and the food amp atmosphere was great  We had drinks on the th floor of the John Hancock building   which on a clear night is spectacular  Overall this is an excellent choice for the Magnificient Mile area of Chicago  
P => great place Location was terrific rooms were just fine and the staff was more than accomadating especially during the crazy New Years Eve  Really liked the fact that across the street is a mini t   able to stock the fridge and grab snacks easily as well as the coffee bar downstairs in the lobby that served up great quotStarbucks qualityquot lattes  This is a perfect place to quothang your hatquot for the day as you spend the days visiting many of Chicagos wonderful sites  
P => Great place to stay in Chicago Stayed here for a work conference  Beautiful suite with a king bed roomy bathroom arate make up area and a living area with sofa bed micro fridge etc  Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as there was an error in my reservation  Works fault not the hotelOrdered room service and the cheese plate was great and the service was very friendly  Checked my bags after checkout so I could sightsee a bit and bell staff were quick to retrieve my bag later and hail me cab  Great location next to the John Hancock building and close to Water Tower Place  Eat at the Food Life food court there and get your nails done in the John Hancock building Would stay again 
P => clean room    great location You will find our family of  usually staying here for a few days every e  It is in a convenient location for both business and leisure travel as it sits a block from the Hancock Tower with easy access via a not yet crowded bus to the convention center  The indoor pool which my kids love on the top floor seems to be some sort of secret because hardly anybody is ever there  The room is not  star luxury but is very clean spacious and comfortable  One minor downside there is no executive lounge which is common in most Hilton hotels  All in all we enjoy our stay every time we are in chicago  
P => Comfortable convenient I really liked this hotel  Our room was nicely sized and comfortable which is exactly what we needed since we were traveling with a small child  Plus we had a great view The location was quite good though in the winter that extra block you need to walk down from the Magnificent Mile is brutal Still it was definitely convenient  Overall a great room for a very reasonable price  
P => minor problems ent deal for a discount price The Hilton Suites is in a great location just a block off Michigan Ave and very close to popular tourist spots like Water Tower the Hancock building and North Beach The hotel was extremely busy and crowded when we arrived  It was Labor Day weekend and I believe there was also a wedding going on at the hotel so this didnt surprise me  I think however they could have done a better job preparing for the crowd  We arrived in a cab with a lot of luggage and were unable to get a bellhop or any hotel employee to help us with our bags or even hold the door open for us as we carried them in  We struggled to get all our luggage past the crowd of people on the sidewalk in front of the door and in the lobby and then had to wait almost  minutes in line at the front desk  Some other frustrated people tried to use the automated check in instead of waiting in line but it wasnt working properly  Not the best first impression We finally got to the front of the line and the staff member who checked us in was friendly and helpful  We were initially given a smoking room not the hotels mistake and were quickly moved to a non smoking room when we asked  Unfortunately the room they put us in had no lights in the bathroom  Both light bulbs over the sink had burned out  When I called the front desk about this I was told that they were out of stock of those light bulbs and wouldnt get any in until the following week  I was a little upset about this especially since it seemed that the staff member was basically telling me there was nothing they could do about it  I asked if we could be moved to another room that had lights in the bathroom and he said he would have a manager call me back A manager never called but they did send someone up to bring us one lightbulb which was apparently taken from the bathroom of some other room  So at least we had some light in the bathroom   but it seemed a little ridiculous that they werent prepared for something like that when they knew they would have a full house for Labor Day We had no other problems during our stay  It was very quiet at night  The rooms were clean and reasonably spacious and the beds were very comfortable  The staff was generally pleasant and helpful  As I said before the location was great  The fact that all the rooms are suites is also a bonus if you need an extra bed  I also liked that the room had a arate vanity which I had to use for getting ready in the morning since we had very dim bathroom lighting a microwave and little refrigerator  There is also a coffee shop and a restaurant open all day in the lobby of the hotel and the stay includes free use of their pool and fitness center  Having one burned out light bulb in the bathroom for the duration of our stay seemed to be a minor issue especially since I got an excellent rate on the hotel room for Labor Day weekend as part of a group rate for a wedding  If however I had had to pay the regular price for the hotel room I think I would have felt a little ripped off  You dont expect something like that from a hotel like this In sum the service was ok the place was clean comfortable and in a great location and it was just fine for a discounted price night  If this is one of the cheaper options you can find to fit your other needs location   of beds in a room etc  it is a ent deal  
P => Simply the Best in Chicago I cant say enough great things about this hotel  I travel to Chicago about six times per year on business and stay at a number of different properties and the Hilton Suites is hands down my favorite  I had stayed at the hotel three years ago when it was still a Doubletree and was very impressed with every aspect of the hotel from the exceptional quality of the rooms beautiful or outstanding service ideal location and fantastic views  Most recently I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel in ust and was equally as impressed with the hotel today as I was during my first visit three years ago  Although the room furnishings and interior or have been modified tastefully the hotel retains all of its excellence  There is no shortage of great hotels in Chicago and Hilton Suites is at the top of my list  I highly recommend this property  
P => Typically wonderful Hilton welcome My husband and I spent a weekend in Chicago to celebrate our birthdays which are less than a month apart  We planned to use public transport to get around so this hotels central location just behind Water Tower Place was great  Its only a few blocks from the nearest subway stop worth the walk even in the near zero temperatures we encountered and buses run up and down the Mag Mile all the time  Hilton Suites are the best of both worlds   the facilities of a proper hotel and the amenities of the type of place that usually caters to business travelers  For instance a Hilton Garden Inn will have a fridge and microwave while a Hilton hotel wont but Hilton Suites have not only a fridge microwave and little sink they also have the sitting area completely arated from the bedroom  Even if you plan to spend a lot of time out sightseeing its always nice to come back and plop down on your sofa in front of your flat screen TV and pull a cold soda or bottle of water out of the fridge and relax Then theres the service  I have found that front desk people at Hiltons are frequently more friendly and helpful than at the other major chains I use  The guy who checked us in was an absolute sweetheart more helpful with tourist hints than the concierge was and really interested in the success of our stay  When we mentioned that that day was my husbands birthday Front Desk Guy paid attention   we got back from Second City that night to find a happy birthday note and delicious carrot cake waiting in our room The room was spacious and clean the neighborhood was interesting shopping museums and safe and the rate was ent for the middle of a major city  Wed go back in a heartbeat  
P => Great location good price Great location nice room layout we do not want super luxury but do want the basic services and these were excellent  Well thought out room and although the bathroom has only one sink there is another small sink at the bar which suffices when the need arises  Since there are several large hotels in the immediate area there are plenty of cabs and there are many bus routes on Michigan Avenue a block away  
P => Good quiet location in Downtown Chicago I guess my problem is Im always comparing the hotel I stay in with others I could have stayed in at the same price in the area  Hilton Suites on a quieter street by the Hancock Building so you can walk across the street to it if you want depends on why youre in Chicago I guess  The woman who checked us in was very nice and ensured that we would have a connecting room with my parents arriving the next day  We were traveling with our kids   and  and had a  double bedssuite for four nights  The hotel was very busy  The bell woman who helped us up with our luggage was the best most informative we have had in a long time  She explained there is a convenient store across the street huge and reasonably priced btw with large wine selection and other info  Very easy to get a cab  Always one in front of the hotel  Walkable to most shops on Michigan Ave  Rooms were newly updated but had a really strong smell possibly carpet glue  I was told all rooms smelled like that but it gave me a really bad headache and I bought travel candles to light when we were in the room  Rooms not huge  Very similar size to Residence Inn quotsuitesquot  Liked that the bathrooom had an entrance both from the living area and the bedroom  Bedroom small but very comfortable beds  No problem with cable tv reception others mentioned  We are Hilton Gold members so I thought we might get an upgrade free internet but no  Got two vouchers for   off breakfast and that was it  Had to use the business center to print boarding passes and the usage fee plus copy fee ran me   Thought that was stiff for a Hilton Suites  Breakfast was not super and service in the restaurant that gets good food reviews was rather rude at breakfast  Food was just ok but a good kids menu  Bar staff was very friendly at night  Overall the small size for a suite room and the really strong room odor made me rate this lower  Really between a  and   Pull out bed not comfortable for kids but what pull out bed is I always leave a tip for housekeeping and still bathroom soapsshampoos La SourceCrabtree Evelyn products were not replaced even though they were used and trash cans not emptied  Could have stayed at Hilton sister hotel the Conrad for the same price and think I would next time if traveling with family  Guess it is about price paid and at almost nt not exactly worth it  If we paid less     There is a small coffee bar in the lobby that sells Starbucks coffee and Krispy Creme donuts and cereal if you want to skip the restaurant  The plans for a full blown Starbucks on site we were told had been canceled  
P => Great Hotel Even Better Staff Overall great service but had a rocky start  Stayed the    they had a very large group with a late pm check out and a sold out hotel for the same evening  This included  motor coaches which showed up on time    pm and the rooms weren t ready It s a small lobby and chaos ensued  It all got resolved around  pm  Nicolette and Abraham rose to the occasion and were grace under pressure hats off to them  The rooms are nice and well appointed  Heads up there is not a safe in the room they are scheduled for next year  Cant beat the location 
P => Loved it   again I just returned from a business trip to Chicago and an overnight stay at the Hilton Suites ChicagoMagnificent Mile  This was my second time at this hotel    the first was exactly a year ago soon after it was converted from a Doubletree to a Hilton This is a very good hotel for the business traveler  I loved the arate bedroom and work areas  The work space was ample and a second table was on casters below the main desk providing more work area as needed  My only negative    and this seems to be a common one    is that there was no safe in the room or at least I couldnt find it The main living space also had a small refrigerator microwave and coffeetea maker  The bathroom was a good size and could be entered from either the bedroom or living room  The king sized bed was very comfortable and I slept well  I was assigned a room directly across from the elevators last two digits are  and was therefore concerned about noise but once I closed the door that concern disappeared  I also had occasion to use the business center on the third floor and the connections were fast and printers and other equipment worked well I used room service for dinner and it was rekably quick  I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and it arrived within ten minutes complete with warm dinner rolls I would also recommend this hotel for families  The sofa in the living room was actually a sofabed and the small refrigerator could hold enough items to cut down on costs  There is a convenience store directly across the street  The hotel itself is in an excellent location near the Hancock building In fact I am thinking of visiting Chicago and the Hilton SuitesMagnificent Mile again    this time with family in tow  
P => For business or pleasure you cant ask for anything more I have rated allot of hotels on this website and not many I choose as excellent but Hilton Suites in Chicago earns it  Not because its opulent or amazing luxurious although its luxuriously modern and functional  I think its outstanding because it has absolutely everything you could possibly need in a hotel on business or pleasure The rooms are very updated modern well maintained and clean  The suite is perfect for those on business wanting a place to work in the living room while watching tv and on the internet  There is lots of room to spread out with a full size couch plasma tv that you can adjust to any place you are sitting a very functional desk and internet access  The bathroom is spacious and full size which is rare in a big city but always appreciated  The bedroom has a wonderful bed and while the bedroom is not huge really all you are doing in there is sleeping so how much room do you need in there  The staff is wonderful and friendly  There is starbucks in the lobby and the hotel restaurant is really good people from outside the hotel eat there I rarely run across hotels that I am completely comfortable with enough room to work sleep and bathe but this hotel has everything you could possibly need and you will feel very comfortable in the suite with plenty of room to spare  It doesnt have the luxury of the Drake or Weston but it has everything you need in a business or pleasure hotel to have a wonderful stay Even if you dont work out you should check out the pool and fitness facility they are on the top floor and have a great view  While the fitness center isnt huge it has modern well maintained equipment Excellent stay at a great hotel with great rooms and services in the perfect location for walking around to eat or shop  If you are in town on business this should be at the top of your list  
P => Great Location We were able to get a rate of  a night through the hotel website which for Chicago seemed to be a good deal for a  night weekend stay  We found the newly reated suites very nice   with a flat screen in the living area and a nice bar  The location was great   convenient to everything  The only complaint that we had was the slowness of the service at breakfast   we were given a voucher for continental breakfast   which they applied to a full breakfast  The cost of valet parking was typical Chicago    a day  
P => Good hotel miss the doubletree cookies We have stayed at this hotel many times as the previous incarnation as a Doubletree and now as the Hilton Suites  Overall it is a very nice hotel and a pretty good deal for the Magnificent Mile area of downtown  We have paid approximately  night on weekend nights  straight off of the hotel website  The prices are actually usually a little bit cheaper if you book earlier in our experience have ranged between   for Sat nights over the last few years PROS  Rooms are very clean bedding is very comfortable   Rooms are quiet now that construction is done  Location  very near the John Hancock building  Views  ask for a high room on the lakeside gorgeous viewsCONS  Flat screen tv in the living room had horrible reception  seriously We didnt watch much tv but the one in the bedroom is the only one that is watchable and Im used to a  inch tv that is  years old   The concierge service is not that great  We tried to get breakfast suggestions and so far have gotten nothing more creative than the Cheesecake factory around the corner   Miss the cookies that they had when it was a DoubletreeNEUTRAL  Front desk staff has varying degrees of helpfulness  Some are somewhat rude  Some bend over backwards to be nice We will continue staying here unless I read about a better place for the same price on tripadvisor 
P => Great Stay for th eprice We stayed for  nights Mid chThe Good  Good location Good price Clean Good Service Nice eats Safe areaThe Nearly Bad  Small room for a suite Charge for wireless silly now a daysThe UglyNone 
P => great room no maid service I booked online prepaid and got a night rate  Room was ready when I arrived at pm sunday night  Room was half way up the tower with a glimpse of the lake between the buildings  It was near the elevator but very quiet  The room is a two room suite with a living room with desk flat screen tv wetbar and sofa  The bedroom had a king bed This room was excellently outfitted for the business traveller  It was the first room I stayed in where I could work on the laptopeat room service and channel surf through the TV all at the sametime from one sitting location  The desk was large and had a pull out table for dinner  So no clearing off the desk for the dinner Moreover the TV was on a wall next to the desk so I could watchthe tube inbetween emails and bites of dinner  The bedroom was small just big enough for the king bed and too small for a regular door  Mine had skinny french doors which wasodd but they worked fine  The bathroom was spacious and everything worked well My only complaint was that they forgot to make up my room while I wasgone all day at work  I came back at pm the next night to find the room as I left it in the morning  I called the operator and the maid service was sent immediately and they quickly replaced my towels etc The rooms are recently reated and they look really nice  Also the hotel has windows that open which means you can get fresh air  This is getting more unusual these days for high rise hotels and it was much appreciated by me especially since the new furniture and carpetin the room still has an odor and thus the rooms can use a bit of airing out from the new materials Another small issue was that I needed a credit card receipt because I paid in advance  Hilton did not email me any receipt and the hotel could not give me the information  So I had to call Hilton after my stay and ask for a receipt  They were able to email me the receipt within an hour of my phone call and I was able to submit withmy business expenses Staff was friendly and helpful  I would stay there again on another trip  
P => Hilton Suites   Id go back again My  y o  son and I enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Suites located one block east of Michigan Avenue along East Delaware Place  The John Hancock Building is directly across the street For tourists this hotel is nicely located  Guests are close to Michigan Avenue but dont have to put up with the traffic noise on that very busy street  Chicago Transit Authority CTA busses to Museum Place Adler Planetarium Shedd Aquarium Field Museum the Chicago Zoo and the Museum of Science and Technology all stop at the corner of Michigan amp Delaware one block from hotel  Many bus lines run northsouth along Michigan Avenue so it is easy to hop on a bus after you get tired of walking along The Magnificent Mile  The nearest subway stop Red Line is the quotChicagoquot station located about  blocks away if I recall correctly  We purchased CTA  day visitor passes  each which allow unlimited use of the bus and subway system  Much cheaper and more convenient than renting a car  Bus drivers and passengers were more than willing to answer questions about quotis this the right busquot  After a day or two we were getting around on CTA like native Chicagoans By the way If you are going to the Blue Man Group show my son loved this show you can easily get there by subway from downtown We used the subway when we returned to OHare airport for our flight home  This worked out quite nicely as we avoided the cost of a shuttle or taxi plus breezed by all of the traffic on the expressway  I wouldnt suggest trying this right at rush hour with your suitcase we left downtown around  p m  and had no problems getting on the subway with our  inch rolling suitcases Our suite on the th floor of the Hilton Suites was as others here have already described  My son used the pull out sofa bed which was perfect for him but an adult might find it uncomfortable Hotel staff ranged from the disinterested doormen who couldnt bother to greet returning guests to the absent never did see a concierge to the helpful front desk personnel I would stay here again  
P => Great room great staff During Easter break we stayed  week nights at the Hilton Suites and found it very comfortable for  adults and  kids ages  amp   Got a suite as reserved and it looked exactly like the pictures on the web site  All updated furnishings and loved the  TVs amp big bathroom  Bedding was great clean amp comfy  Extra bedding for sofa bed stored in zipped plastic bag never seen that before Front desk staff very friendly and helpful  Kids liked the pool good temp and we liked the view  Sauna control was broken but didnt really miss it  We did not hear any disruptive noise during our stay  As others wrote be prepared for expensive parking at hotel we traveled by train amp taxis Restaurant at hotel Mrs  Parks Tavern was very spendy for breakfast  for kids milk   for apple juice we only ate there because of a promotional coupon  Cheesecake Factory nearby is good but very busy  min wait  Make reservation then wait back at hotelI did a lot of research on line before booking this room and made a good choice with the comfort and value we were not disappointed  
P => Easter Break In Chicago Stayed at the Hilton Suites Chicago the week after Easter  My family originally booked the Chicago Hilton but switched to this hotel because of the proximity to attractions shopping on the Magnificent Mile and the many choices of family restaurants within walking distance  Check in was a breeze and the staff was very courteous and helpful with valet parking and bellhop assistance  The room was not a  room suite but we had plenty of room for a family of five  adults  children  Two double beds and a pull out sofa  Had a great view on the th floor of the John Hancock Building  Also microwaves and a mini refrigerator were complimentary which is a great plus with kids Pool was OK and room service was fine  Overall the hotel is a solid choice for families and the location is great  The week had some rough weather but we still managed to have a fun vacation  
P => Hidden gem This hotel is a great choice  My husband and I just returned from a  night stay and we wanted a kitchenette so we ended up here  Even though It was not my first choice I am so glad we did  The room was quiet with urban chic or  Bathroom was large with adjoining dressing area off the bedroom  Down comforter encased in clean sheets  no common bedspread on the Heavenly bed and plenty of down pillows  Thermostat has fan controlls for Hi Low and Auto  Floor to ceiling windows with blackout draperys  Beautifull pool and workout area on the top floor with spectacular views of lake Michigan make an effort to go up  Location is north end by the best boutique shopping and Rush street resuraunts much nicer than by the river  Has a quiet bar and resturaunt so for night life go to the Westin or Drake bars  Coffeemaker is by individual cup but the lobby sells Starbucks  
P => Hideous or With all the lovely hotels in Chicago there is no reason to stay here  My room was not a suite and there was no kitchenette  The lighting was outrageously bad and the or is too ugly for words  The hotel attracts loud groups so beware  
P => Great location and stay Very nice suites with kitchenbar sink small fridge microwave coffee maker sofa desk and plasma TV  arate bedroom area with door and very comfortable bed  Staff very accommodating  Excellent location  Only drawback   the walls  be a bit thin if you are a light sleeper   
P => Great Hotel We visited Chicago on th uary  for  nights We booked this hotel due to the proximity to all the tourist sights in chicago and we were not disappointedThe hotel was fantastic all the staff were very polite and their service was second to none  All the services provided by the hotel were good the restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was delicious  The bar also had no faults and was suitable for a quiet drink with the bar staff being always attentive to your needs while making you feel very welcome The pool although we didnt use it looked good and gave you a view over the lake which was impressiveBut the best part of the hotel for both of us was the room it was spacious but comfortable consisting of a living area with microwave fridge coffee machine plasma tv a well equiped bathroom and a bedroom with the WORLDS MOST COMFORTABLE BED Lets put it this way I would never get up for work if this was my bed at homeThe hotel is in walking distant or a short taxi ride for shopping restaurants and all the major tourist sights  I would recommend to eat at the Cheesecake factory situated under the John Hancock building the banana cream cheesecake for dessert is a must Follow this up by a drink in the signature lounge at the top of the John Hancock building for the most breath taking night time view of the city I also recommend a visit to the Lincoln Park zoo its full of great animals and its freeAll in all an excellent hotel in an excellent city we fully intend to return  
P => Great Near North Value For a most comfortable hotel on the near north side of the city you cannot beat this hotel  Clearly one of the most comfortable hotels weve stayed in and a great value to boot  Only a block from Water Tower shopping and Michigan Avenue with great ammenities   room layout is the best Lobby restaurant was excellent and staff very helpful and courteous  Highly recommend it  
P => Excellent No complaints at all  Nice location friendly staff nice gym amp pool  Will stay here again without hesitation  
P => Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location I stayed at this hotel for  nights during a recent business trip  The room was prepaid by my employer so I have no idea how much it cost  However I can say that the room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable  The location is in Magnificent Mile area next to the Hancock tower as far as I could tell the high end part of downtown Chicago  I felt very comfortable walking around and taking the metro station is about  blocks away  Plenty of upscale shops and restaurants are nearby  I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel 
P => What a nice surprise My son  and I go to Chicago at least once a summer  I booked  nights at the Hilton it was still the Doubletree at that time for free using my Hilton Honors points so I didnt have really high expectations  But free is good We drove in from Michigan on a Friday afternoon circled the block a few times before we ided the Doubletree was now the Hilton and checked in  Warning    valet parking at the hotel is hideously expensive even considering its Chicago    night But again the rooms were free so   Registration must have heeded other peoples feedback    not only was it friendly and efficient but the young woman kept apologizing any time she made me wait more than a nanosecond  Second complaint    there was no offer to help us with our bags to the room  We handled everything but I normally expect the offer in a hotel that nice Room was excellent    large clean elegant well laid out  Flat screen tv in LR enough coffee for me to make it till we went downstairs refrigeratormicrowave for the left over Pizza Uno we brought back Friday pm  LR had comfortable seatage    sleeper couch although my son would dispute the sleeper comfort its no worse than any other side chair desk chair  Had a small view of the lake  Bed was very comfortable with gobs of pillows great linens and a comfortable woolen throw just right for afternoon napping  More than enough closetdrawer space and a cunning little vanity for makeup and hair Best part was the bathroom  I like the  doors    one into my BR one into the LR  Very private and personal  Curved shower curtain bar is a major plus   there is nothing nastier than shower curtain stickage  Good products and lots of towels although rather puzzling no hair dryer Restaurant downstairs is very good Mrs  Parks    my late husband and I had actually dined there several years ago    not fancy but tasty  Vastly overpriced for breakfast    youre better off wandering  blocks to Bistro   Great location for shopping sight seeing etc     we walked lots of places but cht cabs to Wrigley and Second City  In the past my son and I stayed at Lenox Suites or Homewood Suites  Hilton is far nicer in a comparable or better location and has become my preference as long as I can use points again  
P => Perfect for the Family We stayed at this lovely hotel in   with our family of kids  We had  suites which were adjoining and perfect for our family  They were newly reated and in excellent condition  The bathrooms are new the beds are fluffy and fresh the staff was friendly and accomodating  We had excellent service the Valet inparticular was so helpful with our car always going in and out in the city  The location is excellent in the City right off ofMichigan Avenue  Could not have had a better area in the city  It was very residential but accessible to all  THe pool was great for the kids and room service was always good  We felt so fortunate to have found this great spot with our big family We would def go back 
P => What a great surprise First a caveate we paid the Hilton employee rate of  night although not actually employees  We spent  nights here then moved to the more quotupscalequot Conrad and were much more impressed with the Doubletree  The size of the room is amazing  The arate rooms the wetbar fridge and micro and coffee  Lovely lovely and comfortable   The pool was a real treat  I expected a typical midwestern indoor pool but the view was fantastic  Gorgeous views of the lake and the Handcock building  and the pool area with its tiled walls and sky high windows     well I just wish we got to spend more time  The second time we tried to go to the pool there were no towels so we left  Thats my only complaint  The only negatives were poor organization at checkin and trying to check our bags until our room was ready was a bit of a challenge  Theres no real bar at the hotel always empty and closed by ten  The coffee shop is outrageous    for a premade cold wrapped sandwich  We live in San Diego which is expensive but even here the Hilton coffee shop sandwiches are only   Over all the location is perfect  Walked everywhere  If we couldnt walk we took the subway El  Great great great  Went to the Signature Lounge at the Handcock twice  Shopped on Michigan ave  Took in a Cubs game just a quick ride up the red line  Architectural boat tour Field Museum  Museum of Contemporary Art is right around the corner  Everything convenient to this location Left a mostly full bottle of Absolute vodka in the fridge   oops  Hope the housekeeper enjoyed it   it was well earned  
P => Great stay at the Doubletree Stayed at the Doubletree for a  night weekend at the end of e  Used Hilton Honors rewards but the room was listed at over  per night on the website  We had a one king suite on the th floor with an awesome view of Lake Michigan  Our room was very recently redone as a matter of fact there was still the smell of paint in tha hall way with the flat screen tv  Bed was very comfortable with nice linens and tons of pillows  Liked the arate make up vanity so one could shower while one finished up outside of bathroom  Mini fridge great for holding those take out cheesecake slices from Cheesecake Factory  Location was perfect for us we walked everywhere except Andys Jazz Club we cabbed  Walked to Navy Pier Ogden boat slip for river tour Museum of Contemp  Art up and down Michigan Ave beach tons of restaurants nearby  Ate at Bistro  Andys Saloon Steakhouse for dinner top of the Hancock for lunch highly recommend lunch here  Had breakfast one morning in hotel restaurant good food service and speedy  Other mornings got juice and muffins from the coffee stand in lobby  We used the exercise room twice small but nice machines and amazing city view it is on the top floor also where the pool is  Hotel staff was very nice concierge particularly helpful  We would stay here again 
P => Pretty Good Stay Stayed at the Doubletree e     With the exception of some problems at check in I enjoyed this hotel and would stay there again  Also the air conditioner didnt work in our room and it took  phone calls to correct the problem  Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful  There is a grocery store right across the street that made fabulous sandwiches  The beds were AWESOME as were the pillows  Note the pull out sofa bed in our room was very uncomfortable and was not meant for one adult to sleep on let alone two  Would probably be ok for a small child  The location was perfect  We got a good rate for our rooms and would stay there again in a heartbeat for the same rate  
P => The hotel made the trip Highly recommended hotel  Spacious generously sized recently reated rooms with mini fridge and microwave but note no dishes are provided  Loved the LCD flat screen TV in the living room and entrances to the bathroom from both the living and bedrooms  Convenient coffee bar in lobby  Fantastic location across from John Hancock building and one block from Lake Michigan  My standard room even boasted a sliver view of the lake  Note there is rather noisy construction at a parking garage next to the John Hancock but I was not able to hear it from my room and I am very particular about noise  Michigan Avenue and all buses are one block away subway line is about a ten minute walk to Chicago station  Staff was extremely friendly at check in and out  Arriving in my room I was absolutely overjoyed with the accomodations 
P => Good but not great Our family of four stayed at the Doubletree for six nights and were awakened each morning by construction noise in the suite across the hallway  When I complained to the front desk staff about the hammering that started at about  I was told that sometimes the workers start even earlier implying I guess that I should be thankful She offered to switch our room but informed me that the construction was going on all over the hotel and could not guarantee a more quiet suite  The suite itself was nice but small  The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean  The jacuzzi near the pool however was dirty  and remained that way even though we showed an employee the mildew growing on the sides  The pool water was nice and warm and the view from that room was wonderful  This hotels location and reasonable rates are its best assets  
P => Absolutely the best beds ever Our family of four stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Chicago for a long weekendwedding  Our accommodations were at a group rate for  for a  room suite which included a very spacious living room with desk plasma tv fold out sofa very comfortable according to my picky teenage dhter chair coffee table and sinkfridgemicrowave station as well as a bedroom with another tv  double beds dresser table and a large bathroom  The suite appeared to have been recently reated as everything was in top condition  The best thing about our entire stay were THE BEDS These were the most comfortable luxurious beds I have ever slept in at any hotel  From the soft plush down pillows and comforter to the cushiony but firm mattress to the luxurious sheets   it was a pleasure to go to bed at night All of the guests at the hotel from our group raved about their beds Service at the hotel was what should be expected at any hotel courteous considerate and kind  We had a mistaken charge on our bill that was promptly removed  The bellmen were always gracious when storing our luggage before and after our stay for a few hours  I also appreciated the maid service for our room who when we walked through the doorway as she was finishing up her cleaning made sure to verify that our room key worked for the room before she departed  She was very kind and never made us feel uncomfortable  The location of this resort is ideal for those who want a short walk to the Magnificent Mile shops and the John Hancock building  The location service accommodations and price made us very happy with our stay and ready to return the next time we visit Chicago  
P => Perfect for Families Just got back from a stay here at the Doubletree in Chicago  My husband and I took our  year old dhter with us this time The room was perfect a tad on the small side but very clean and simple room  It was nice having two rooms  so after she went to sleep we could enjoy a little wine and tv without waking her up The room had a nice size fridge which is very nice when traveling with a toddler  The hotel location is perfect for running around in the city  very central to everything and a bus stop for the major museums right at the corner  The pool upstairs was plus too Nothing fancy but very clean and quiet with a pretty view Overalll we were very pleased with the hotel great location and value 
P => Great Stay Nice Location Great Hotel Had a nice stay at this Doubletree  I was worried when I read of what people wrote  Rooms Clean large comfortable beds and pillowsHotel Nice clean staff were helpful and freindlyLocation  Block over from Mag  Mile near Lake shopping etc  I would stay again for the location and price  
P => Nice but not great This is not the best Double Tree we have stayed at  The room was clean the beds very comfy and the location was great  BUT    the room was on the small side and a smidge stale smelling  My sister stayed in a room on the other side of the building  Her view was fantastic ours was so so  We might go again just for the location  
P => very average My husband  year old dhter and I former Chicago residents have stayed in this hotel four times in the past  months  Our most recent was    Each time we stay we say we do not want to return but still keep coming back The location as has been mentioned is perfect  I love it  The staff overall are very friendly  The rooms are quite shabby and really need updating for example the couches are quite worn  I have never seen the pool too busy but it always too cold  During our last stay I asked twice to have the heat increased in the pool  The first person told me it could not be increased the second was able to turn it up slightly  The view from the pool is beautiful  The equipment in the work out room is all fairly new and well keptclean Each time we plan a trip to Chicago I look and look and end up at the Doubletree because of the price  You can stay in hotels with the same level of rooms and pay  much  more in similar locations The Embassy Suites for example  If you are willing to put up with a few issues shabby room cold pool good but not great service in exchange for a fabulous location and a low rate then the Doubletree is the place  
P => Nice stay at Doubletree First of all This hotel is in a great location  Right across you will find the John Hancock Center and Magnificent Mile is just one block away The service was generally friendly and helpful even though sometimes not very talkative The rooms are just fine my room was absolutely identical to the one advertised on the Expedia Website  I was given a room on the th floor which didnt have much of a view but was quiet and clean so I didnt mind  It seems as if you should try to avoid rooms close to the elevators because they are busy the whole night Room service was perfect and I really enjoyed the Blenz Cafe in the Lobby which serves little treats   and you can enjoy free wireless broadband Internet access there if you bring your Notebook along   there are no PCs available  I enjoyed this feature a lotOverall I would definitely stay at Doubletree Guest Suites again as location and price are perfect and the service and rooms are above average  
P => Wonderful experience My husband and I are frequent vistors of Chicago we stayed at other hotels like the Intercontinel on Michigan Ave which was also very nice  Doubletree was in a great location we walked to the Cheesecake Factory Dicks Last Resort Unos etc  The room was very clean and spacious the staff was also very helpful  I would definitely stay here again and recommend others to come  
P => Excellent location only one block off the Magnificent Mile We stayed here for five nights  Four of us  adults  children were very comfortable in a two room suite  The rooms are clean amp quiet and the beds are very comfortable  Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful  Umbrellas were provided to guests on rainy days  The pool and spa are a big plus after a long day  Yes it gets a bit crowded in the evening but not so bad after  p m  Easy walking distance to restaurants   try Cedar and Rush streets for something other than franchise food  I would highly recommend the Doubletree to anyone travelling with children  
P => First Time To Chicago My dhter lives there now and this was our first time to Chicago and the hotel was quite good  The price was reasonable and that is something I pay attention to because of the exchange rate Canadian to U S adds at least   to your bill  On check in you do get the warm Chocalte Chip cookies which is a nice touch  The rooms are not huge but more than acceptable and the beds are soooooooooo comfortable  Location is fantastic and the food in the restaurant is o k  Staff are very friendly and helpful yet low keyed which was fine  Over all we had a great stay and would go back with out hesitation  I should mention the pool and the hot tub and although the pool isnt huge I have seen smaller at other hotels  Hot tub was great  Exercise facilities were well equiped  Again well worth the price of admission  
P => Right in the action This was our first time visiting Chicago so I just had to research hotels on the internet and take a shot  We knew we wanted to be near the Magnificent Mile as well as Navy Pier  We have  kids and wanted to feel safe walking downtown  It turned out to be a great location   We were treated to warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival and found our accomodations wonderful  The children slept in the sleeper sofa in the front room with their own TV and we had the privacy of the bedroom plus a arate dressing area   The pool on the top floor had breathtaking views of the lake and surrounding city  The water was plenty warm and the jacuzzi was welcome  My husband worked out in the fitness facility with the same awesome views   We had breakfast at the bakery on the main level that served Krispy Kremes They also had fruit yogurt and other simple items  The best thing was being so close to everything My  year old dhter and I trolled the shops at night and we were right across from the mall There was an electric vibe with trendy eateries and shoppers galore   We took the bus to the Museum of S and I which was an experience in itself  The hotel staff was a bit lost on helping with transportation but we got there It took forever and we had a few transfers but it was fun to see the bustling Chicago work week in action  Ive never seen so many high heeled boots and Burberry scarves  We also walked to Navy Pier  It was a bit of a hike especially in the  degree   weather but an easy route and very doable   Id definitely stay at the Doubletree Suites again  Great location practical accomodations for my family and reasonable price especially for downtown 
P => Would recommend Be advised the double beds are full size but SO COMFORTABLE I would buy the mattress if I didnt already buy one that I havent paid off yet  Also they have white down comforters that are so fluffy and cozy beats those normal hideous bedspreads you usually see in hotels  They try to make you feel at home   The free cookies rock and its the best location I have ever stayed in Chicago and Ive been there countless times  Would recommend  
P => Good Location Big Room My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree East Delaware on     For the record the week between Christmas and New Years is an awesome time to go to Chicago because hotel rates are often below  for a nice room  That is at least a   savings over other weeks  The Doubletree rate for this day was  for a suite on the  st floor with a good view of Lake Mich  The room was in good if not great shape  erate living area and bed area with erate doors into the bathroom   Small sink and fridge in living room but no microwave  All in all the room was worth the price and I would not hesitate to go back with my kids  l r  couch folded out into a huge bed  The location is great one block to the Drake  Three to four blocks to all the food and fun of rush and division  Just a quick walk unless the weather is cold then I would taxi it    The check in and check out was really quick  The attitude of the workers was also good  One small problem  parking out front and waiting for an attendant could be a real pain in the drain as their are few spots in front of the hotel  We lucked out    but on a Sunday morning it could be a   minute wait for your car easily    
P => Very Disappointing This is a great location and the staff was generally friendly but the service and state of our room  was poor  Shabby furniture and a huge crack along the whole length of the bathroom sink The maid did not leave towels neither did the turn down service  It took TWO calls to housekeeping to get towels  The toliet overflowed  it took an hour for someone to come fix it  Then that person did not mop up the half inch of water  Two more calls and another hour later someone came to mop it up Now after midnight  That person used half the towels mopping it up No replacements The ethernet connection did not work  that took two calls and eight hours to fix  They charge   for in room internet connection  a fact NOT noted anywhere on the numerous ads for it or on the website  There is however free wireless in the lobby  I admit hotels charging extra for internet is a pet peeve of mine but my real complaint is the lack of communciation about the charge when one reserves  or at least in the room Also if noise and bustling is a problem for you know in advance it is filled with families and kids  Not a big deal for me but it is for some folks Next time well stay elsewere  
P => Heavenly Served I travel to Chicago three or four times a year and I always stay here  The location is ideal and the view is breath taking  The hotelrooms are modern and kept updated  Downstairs there is a restaurant and a starbucks that provide excellent service  The staff is professional courteous and I thank them for each and every stay without them the hotel would not be the same The valet is a third party contract so dont hold it against the Doubletree only the General Manager for hiring them  They lost my car dont ask me how  After waiting an hour with no luck on their search I had to take a cab  Sure enough by the time I returned  hours later they located my rental it was okay just misplaced  
P => A Place to return to I have stayed at this hotel when in Chicago on business for a number of years  Location Location Location Yes    the rooms could use some reation but for the price the size and amenties are great  The indoor pool is a real plus and the staff are fine not great but perfectly sufficient for this type and price class of hotel  Some rooms have views of nothing and some have great views  You get what you pay for  This is a great quiet hotel for a business or shopping excursion  
P => Excellent Service Before we travelled from Barbados we read the reviews and were a little skeptical after we read some of the negative comments about the hotel  We couldnt change as my wife was going to a conference and this is the hotel that her company chose  On arrival we were pleasantly surprised   we got the cookies even a set for our  month old   He even got another on check out The staff from the bellmen to the front desk staff were extremely courteous and helpful  The suite was clean as expected but as mentioned by another reviewer the minibar was filled with and left very little space for any personal items  This was a bit of a challenge as we needed to refridgerate some of our babys food stuff  The suite did not have a microwave but we asked for one and got it on the third day after someone checked out  If you need one make sure and request it when you book the room  Even then someone from guest services took the baby food and microwaved it for us On the first day we were expecting a package and security couldnt find it  They then discovered that it had not yet been inventoried as having been received had not yet been placed in the proper area so for the inconvenience we were comped a movie The restaurant food was nice but a bit expensive but hey this is the Magnificent Mile We discovered on our th night that the front desk has menus from Diningin com that list over  restaurants that you can order from and have delivered to your door All in all I can say that this was a great stay at a great hotel  ALL of the staff were pleasant and in my opinion the service was above par  Will definitely stay there again and recommend it highly  
P => Great staff nice pool BUT horrid hotel I love trip advisor and use the reviews a lot when booking vacations but boy did it steer me wrong this time  Briefly the staff was very helpful the pool nice but the hotel itself and the rooms are awful  People you can do so much better at the Wyndham or the new Embassy Suites Lakefront for a cheaper price and breakfast included I choose the Doubletree because of the rave reviews it received and because of the great location right across from John Hancock  I booked an executive suite so we would have a great view  Well the veiw was as promised but the room was just dismal  Dirty carpets torn and filthy upholstery doors falling off the closet  The room was a smoking room as well although I had booked a non smoking one  The manager great guy very helpful told me that they were full and they had one room left which they were cleaning  I asked if it was perhaps better quality then the one we were staying in and he sadly shook his head no  He took me to see the room which was just as dismal and dingy as the one we were in  I didnt want my children even sitting on the furniture  He apparently agreed with me about the quality of the rooms and offered to do whatever would make me happy  I asked him to find other accomodations for us which he quickly did at the new lakefront Embassy Suites loved it  He then called the Bell Captian to assist us and arranged for our car to be brought around  On the way to get our luggage the Bell Captain also a very nice guy told us that we would be much happier at the other hotel  That about says it all By the way there were no chocolate chip cookies to be found  
P => A haven of peace  Away from the lifts  Aaaaah  I had an unexpected two night stop in Chicago  The first night I spent at the OHare Hilton  In order to recover I phoned a friend for some advice and ended up here  This is lovely  Big big rooms  Suites even  As standard I am currently sitting in my loungekitchen and can see my bedroom tempting me to one side and the bathroom to the other  I have two tellys This is the life Location is cool   just off Michican Avenue posh shops for those not in the know and close to the various quotI did it firstquot Chicago Pizza Pie restaurants  There is a swimming pool on the th floor that has views over Lake Michigan  There You want to come here already Minus one k for noisy lifts  Im such a perfectionist
