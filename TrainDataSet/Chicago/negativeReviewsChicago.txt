N => Writing This Review While Still on Property I plan on following up with a full review later however I wanted to give an initial impression while were still on property  We are finnicky sp and frugal when it comes to accommodations  With that said we  myself wife and  year old dhter  have found ourselves forced to slow down and forget our busy schedules etc  We could not be happier      
N => Above and beyond My boyfriend booked us a room at The Trump as a surprise for our anniversary  Of course with the name Trump attached to this hotel you expect a lavish upscale hotel  Aside from being lavish and upscale this hotel has customer service that far surpassed any expectations I had  Upon arrival to the hotel every staff member knew my boyfriend and I by name greeted us with genuine smiles and were always very quick to offer help and assistance in anyway we needed Our room was not ready when we arrived so to make up for our delay the hotel upgraded our suite to a  square foot room and offered complimentary drinks at their on site bar Rebar  After having a few non alcoholic drinks I am expecting we went back to the front desk to check on the status of our room which was still not ready  Shortly after explaining that I was expecting and needed to get situated so that we could go to dinner our room was ready  The room was absolutely gorgeous  we had a panoramic view from ceiling to floor of Navy Pier which later benefitted us as we watched the weekend fireworks show from our chase lounge at pm  The spacious room was more like a condo complete with a full kitchen microwave dishwasher oven fridge plates silverware etc    full bathrooms living room dining room and bedroom  The living room and bedroom both have large flat screen TVs  Each area in the room can be individually temperature controlled  Shortly after settling into our room we received a knock at the door actually a ring from the doorbell from room service delivering a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary from the staff complimentary of course After enjoying that we then received a phone call from the hotel manager apologizing to us for the lengthy wait for our hotel room and offering us a later check out time and complimentary breakfast of our choice from the restaurant Sixteen or room service which later totalled to be over   Every service that this hotel offers has special extras which makes it even more fun to order  Throughout the night we enjoyed their  hour room service including ordering a Trump Sundae twice  Everytime you order the staff will gladly set your table for you where ever you choose to dine near the window at the dining room table bedside etc  The next morning our paper was delivered breakfast was served promptly  We loved the robes and watching TV in the bathroom while getting ready  Upon checkout we were again greeted by name and asked if everything had met our standards which it of course did  I would highly reccomend this hotel and would gladly stay again   and again  One more thing although the hotel is under construction we were never disturbed by any noise detours or construction workers  This hotel works hard to ensure that your stay is as peaceful and relaxing as possible  
N => Loved The Trump I booked a girls weekend at this hotel  Almost didnt book the hotel as read some negative reviews about the service  Not sure where those reviews were coming from because that was not my experience  From the moment that the taxi dropped us off the service was nearly flawless  The bellman without seeing luggage knew my name and everyone in the hotel did for that matter  This is the first time at the hotel and it was very impressive  Everyone was so friendly and everyone always said hello no matter where you where on the property  The concierge George was the best  He even walked us to the restaurant for lunch as he thought we might get lost  When we checked in we received hot towels for our hands and water  Our room  bedroom suite was lovely with gorgeous views of the river  This suite had plenty of room for  girls  I did tell the reservationist when booking that we were celebrating a birthday  The hotel one day sent us champagne not a cheap bottle and a tray of chocolate the next day we received gorgeous flowers and another day we received a chocolate cake  We are not celebrities nor we we paying a rack rate  In fact I had a rate of pay for two nights and get one night free  I have stayed all over the world and have never been treated so well  The health club was large and brand new  There was a nice touch of putting voss water by your bed each night  The housekeeping service was great and have us as much as voss water as we needed for our stay  Originally I was going to stay at the Sofitel and am so glad that I cided to stay here  We went to the R Bar which was nice but didnt stay as the views from our room were better  I wouldnt have any second thoughts about booking here or staying here again  TRUMP really knows how to hire the right people  This was an excellent experience  
N => Wonderful weekend in Chicago We just got back from a wonderful weekend at The Trump hotel in Chicago  It was our first visit to the city and we enjoyed every minute of it  The hotel itself was beautiful  Still under some construction but we were not affected by it  The staff was always courteous  The pool and spa were fabulous  We had drinks at Rebar which was very nice and breakfast one morning at Sixteen  The food was delicious but a little on the expensive side  All in all it was a great trip  
N => Absolutely velous My family and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for a sight seeing trip of Chicago and celebrate my dhters th birthday  Everything was perfect  They greeted us with smiles and wished my dhter Happy Birthday they even had a special cake and card brought to our room  Service throughout our stay was exceptional  The staff catered to our every needs  It was a velous experience and we would highly recommend this fine establishment  
N => Donald   You cant be Trumped We checked in after a hr haul from South Africa and immediately we felt like we quothad arrivedquotI cannot agree with the other reviews here as we found the Receptionists and the Concierge people especially very efficient amp friendly Our room had a city view but we were on the th floor which was great  The room was orated in a truly modern style with large quot HD flatscreen TV  Bose audio on the bedside  Trump goes out of its way to provide all the essentials and a huge array of hotel creature comforts  The piece de resistance must surely be the beautiful huge bedmattress and the most lavish pillows  Our first nights sleep was so good we only woke up after midday They must have taken heed of previous comments concerning the late housekeeping but during our entire  day stay they were most attentive and punctual The Spa  Pool are a delight as well as the well equipped gym   we could have stayed on for another weekWe have to congratulate Donald Trump amp Bill Rancic on a  Star experience  We doubt we could afford the normal rack rates but because of the building works we got a summer discount which made it possible for us to experience this lifestyle as well as the most beautiful city in USA WE LUV U CHICAGOSaukat amp Shirine Dudhia 
N => Fantastic hotel at perfect location   but reception staff not up to scratch Stayed  nights at the hotel  Nice luxury but small mistakes allover  Room not cleaned until after pm in afternoon  Front desk staff seemed to be a little out of focus and did not pay attention to your questions or needs  
N => Cool Hotel We stayed in a one bedroom suite which easily accommodated our two children as well as ourselves about  sq ft  and was about the same cost as two rooms in other hotels  The hotel interiors are high quality using modern material and contemprary furniture and fittings  The colour schemes were generally in the taupecreambeigebrown crisp white bed linen neutral range with zebra wood and steel used as accents throughout  Limestone bathrooms had perfect grouting and mastic lines   this project was really well managed to get that level of detailed finish  The overall impression was high quality reserved modern rather than bling The sound proofing between the living room and the bedroom was excellent  The suite has two bathrooms   which speeds up the morning rituals especially when travelling with girls Our whole experience of the hotel was excellent  Other reviews have noted the high end kitchen fitting bathroom fittings and audio visual equipment   so no more has to be said on that front  The airconditioning was very quiet coming from a county that does not use AC generally   it is helpful to have a very quiet system when one is trying to sleep Any time we went to the pool   we had it to ourselves and be one other person  The pool has no real deep end which would suit small children who do not like diving  The view from the pool area is down the river to the lake and also towards the Loop  I did feel that the exposed surface finish on the pool area ceiling was very like fire safeing used on steel work and could have been upgraded to a more orative finish  The changing room was high quality with all the accessories one would need Signage between the poolexercise area and the changing rooms might need to be upgraded because when I was waiting for my small dhter to finish her shower out came an unclad man from the sauna   who tried to convince me that we were in the mens room   luckly I noticed the womens products on the counter top previously so I knew we were in the right room I drew his attention to that fact and he left and she was none the wiser Check in amp out were really quick  The staff were always so helpful and friendly  Housekeeping was a bit slow on a couple of occassions in that the room has not been made up by mid afternoon even though we would have been out of the room since early in the morning The construction work didnt really affect our stay  We did notice the noise of the lift when we went back to our room mid afternoon  There was no noise after pm  There is scaffolding at ground level but there still are clear walkways to the varoius streets  The windows are a bit dirty given the work proceeding at high level but again nothing that would really affect ones stay I would recommend this hotel to any catagory of guest   however do book in soon to avail of a five star hotel at affordable prices  
N => Wonderful Hotel My husband and I just stayed  nights at the Trump International and as many have said it did NOT disappoint  Although the first room we were in had quite a bit of construction noise I asked if there were anything else and they immediately moved us to the opposite side of the hotel where we had a wonderful river view  We had a Deluxe river room which was lovely  My husband said that he was quotin troublequot because I was so spoiled by the ammenities and service that I will never be satisfied with a quotregularquot hotel again  The staff were wonderful  Unobtrusive but able to quickly answer any question we had  They ALWAYS had doors open for us when we were coming and going  One thing that set this hotel apart was that we always felt that we were given individual service as opposed to quotwhats best for the massesquot Cant wait to return I hope we can afford it after it is completed 
N => Ottimo hotel in ottima posizione  
N => Old and snobby Im very surprised about the good reviews about this property  I was bitterly dissappointed  At check in for example the front office manager in his tired suit pointed out the dress code to me   referring to the fact that I was wearing st jeans The room was quite big but furnished rather in a taste for old people  Also it was cold   the heating did not go over  degrees  The beds however were really comfortable I had a function there in the evening  Staff was not very friendly or helpful throughout the hotel  We were travelling in a small group and no one felt made welcome or looked after  This was my first trip to Chicago and all I can say that I will go to a hotel next time  
N => If you put lipstick on a pig it is still a pig After a flight cancellation compliments of United Airlines the WORST airline we arrived to a middle  of  nowhere suburbian hotel full of Pink Cadillacs from the y Kay Convention participants  It didnt cost us a dime to stay check in was a breeze took the CTA to quotdowntown Chicagoquot as there sure isnt anything to do in the area  Room was average clean comfy beds     but the NOISE backing onto the highway    all night long    zoom zoom zoom  Dated furniture torn wallpaper in spots carpet seen better daysThinking back I guess for free it was OK  
N => Not what I expected I was there last spring for a convention  I found the Hotel stale and cold  The rooms were dated the staff not friendly and there was a large crack in the ble sink in my bathroom which caused water to run onto the floor every time I used it  After repeated calls to the front desk no help arrived  I was disapointed my rate was  per night I wont be back  Not the quality I expect from Westin  
N => Now this is LUXURY When went to the Westin Chicago NW for a Fly Fishing Expo ruary    It was pretty  Relaxing stuff all over  candles water etc  and i just thought to myself    yah rightWe requested a quiet room since we live in an Industrial Park it is nice to have peace and quiet once in awhile  We got to the th Floor Room and I heard the air rushing around the Atruim  I was concerned but all the rooms open into the central courtyard they would all have this noise  The room was gorgeous It was SPA  like with a peaceful green color and expresso colored modern furniture  Back to yah right They even had a flat scren TV on the wall Heavenly Beds was on the card in the room Yah right  WOW we slept like puppies curled up in that unbelievably comfortable bed That room was so relaxing it felt like being a week on vacation and it was only one night Request the front of the building and over look the highways merging  It was like watching a fireplace it was so mesmerizing  
N => Avoid this one like the plague I had the misfortune of having to stay here  nights for a business convention  My biggest complaint was the rooms  They are old carpets are stained bathroom fixtures are pathetic as well as the furnishings  I switched rooms three times to try and land in a ent one  It was absolutely the biggest waste of money I have experienced in a long time  I was made aware upon departure that the hotel is going through some remodeling and will be a Westin in a few months  The Wyndham should be celebrating to get their name off this property  The food was less than spectacular as well  Honestly I cant think of a good thing to say about this property  Just please take my advice and DO NOT STAY here   at least until it becomes the Westin  
N => Very poor service at this hotel beautiful lobby tired  I booked this hotel for  nights for a vacation  If I hadnt prepaid I would have left after the first night  There was major construction going on in the hotel which they didnt tell us about when booking  The construction started at between   a m  each day and lasted all day with pounding sawing etc  going constantly  Not a pleasant way to wake up or spend your day The last night we received a letter stating our water would be turned off due to construction at  the next morning amp  need access to our room for construction  Check out time is  so this did not make me happy at all  Upon checking with the front desk I was told they couldnt do anything about it couldnt move us to another room and would not credit our bill even though we would basically have to get up and shower amp check out early  Thats fine for business but not what I wanted to do on my vacation  The best they could do was give us free breakfast in the morning which was nice but not adequate compensation in my opinion for the noise and inconvenience for  nights On one hand it is good they are remodeling the hotel  The rooms Ive seen needed it badly  There was grout falling off the tub the carpet was stained the or very dated and the mattresses and bedding were horrible  The mattress was bad enough that we went to a local store after the first night and bought a mattress pad to put on top of it even though that meant we had to cart the pad home after our vacation This hotel will probably be very nice once the remodeling was done but my advice is to avoid this place like the plague for the near future unless you like sleeping in a work zone  
N => Not Bad Overall I reserved a King room but was assigned two small double beds why is this SO common  Upon calling the desk I was told unapologetically that they were overbooked by  rooms my problem  Bedding is of the old quotbedspreadquot variety not the up to date duvet style  The carpet in my room had what appeared to be bleach spots all over it   very unappealing  The atrium design  look impressive but when theres a boisterous group at the bar until am as there was while I was there the noise reverberates throughout making it difficult to fall asleep  Bring earplugs  The immediate area is priily office buildings  No services or restaurants within walking distance  Short drive to many restaurants though  The gym in the building charges  to work out and it closes far too early pm  The hotel does not have its own exercise room  Room service food was impressive   best Ive had in a long time  
N => Good hotel Although a little old the furnishings and room service was great  Staff was very friendly and bed was comfortable  I traveled here for business as well as a lot of the other guests but there was no free highspeed internet  Otherwise not a bad hotel at all  
N => I will never be back The office opens only a few hours  The lights of stairs were off during our  days stay very dangerous  No hot meals in the breakfast  Once their supply of yogurt has gone Tube type quotGogurtquot for kids was supplied  The maid service entered even though we requested not to enter the room and changed the location of personal items  A few personal items were lost  No notice for charge of internet  bucks a day and phone calls  Overall the hotel is worse than super  motel although you pay over  bucks  
N => A memorable stay We stayed at the Wheeler Mansion and had an absolutely incredible experience  We were supposed to stay at a different hotel and had made reservations over a month ago  We got to that hotel and it was absolutely filthy  We ended up checking out of that hotel and were literally on the streets looking for a ent place to stay  To our surprise Wheeler Mansion came to rescue  Not only did we get lucky with a spare room that they had available we also got amazing service  The staff was extremely nice and very helpful  They helped us find places to visit gave us maps to nearby shopping and restaurants and provided unmatched service  We would highly recommend anyone who wants to visit chicago to forget staying at the quotname brandquot hotels and try out the Wheeler Mansion  It feels like home  It feels cozy and the service is incredibleWe will definitely stay here again  
N => What a wonderful change of pace We stayed at the Wheeler Mansion while attending the National Restaurant Show at McCormick Place  Lukas was a wonderful host and made the stay very comfortable  He was genrous with his time and information about the area  Though we are from the Chicagoland area we had not been in this part of town for a long time and it had changed so much  It was a pleasure to be only walking distance from so much including McCormick Place Breakfast was a bit like a european continental and nicely laid out  My only suggestion to the hotel owners is to improve the lighting in the bathroom  Hard to put on makeup  Otherwise it was well appointed and interesting to boot Definately a nice change of place to the quotBig Boxquot hotels in the area  We would definately stay here again  
N => Wonderful place to stay I was staying with Wheeler Mansion Hotel in il    during my business trip to US  I was really concern about staying in this hotel after I read some older reviews but I had no choice  Hyatt was sold out at The Wheeler Mansion was right by McCormick and only one besides them  I was surprised the place was great  I m   European and I love antiques furniture s  The cost of the rooms was very reasonable and I had really nice and tasty breakfast every morning  The staff was very friendly and help full  They take care of my transportation reservation for restaurant for my clients  I would defiantly recommend that place to any one and its totally different expiries for hotels  Was so quiet and felt almost like home  
N => Over rated We were the only guests in this small hotel  When we arrived front door was locked and we had to bang hard to get the only member of staff to open it  She had only been working there  weeks and did not like the work was clearly stressed altho tried to do her best Her alternate the manager was much ore engaging but promised to meet us with tickets to a particular event at a particular time only to tiurn up an hour later with no apology Hotel promises gourmet breakfasts   but doesnt deliver  Also unable to have breakfast any earlier than  weekday and  weekends  No bar in hotel and when we stayed no possibility of dinner in the evenings  Overall felt like an overpriced BampB   wouldnt recommend  
N => Good Saitan gone BAD I have stayed at this bed amp breakfast now for the third time and will NEVER stay there again  Let me start by saying the place sure has great potential thanks to its old style charm and unbeatable location for business travellers attending McCormick Place  Management however seems absolutely set on driving it to the ground  I have never encountered such attitude not to say abuse of guests  From the time we checked in through the time we left there were numerous incidents more befitting an old style Soviet gulag facility than an upscale expensive hotel  Here are just a few examples  Upon arrival we parked the car on back and walked through open gate only to find back door locked with no bell in sight  In freezing cold we knocked on door  When manager finally opened after we called phone inside his first comment was quotwhy did you not use call box outsidequot  Thats warm welcome Wheeler Mansion style   The next morning Sunday our group which BTW rented ALL  rooms for the week had an early start at McCormick Place  We asked if we could have breakfast at  or  instead of the scheduled   The response quotthis would be against our rulesquot   The next morning Monday we had one colleague leaving and another one checking in  As the new guy is at the door in front of us one staff member said to another quotwhat is he doing here he was supposed to get here between  quot the time was about     The manager went to open the door then came back and in front of us said I dont like the attitude here this morningquot     Then there was the freezing temperatures the cold breakfasts and a general sense that we were not guests but some unwanted intruders to get rid of Before we left we asked the manager for an explanation  quotIm just following the owners ordersquot he said  After speaking with the owner Id have to say I believe him  Bottom line if you are looking for any ent hospitality in Chicago   this is NOT the place for you 
N => Defrauded and cheated My husband and I went to Chicago from Spain in ober to attend the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology at the McCormick Center  We booked a room in the Wheeler Mansion through our travel agent to whom we paid in advance according to the invoice the Wheeler Mansion had emailed to the agency  However when we were checking out after staying five days they billed us for our stay  When we protested that we had paid in advance we were told that we had to pay them because they did not deal with travel agents in spite of the fact that they had arranged the booking and had already charged the travel agency   of the total amount  What s more we learnt that the room they had assignes us was much more expensive that the one we had reserved  It seems that they ided to upgrade us without letting us know  We did not have time to argue about this because we had a taxi waiting for us to take us to the airport to catch a flight  So we had to pay the bill again plus the extra charge for the quot better roomquot To add insult to injury they were extremely rude to us ignoring we do not speak English fluently  Subsecuently the hotel refunded to the travel agents the   they had paid and the agency reinbursed us for the amount we had paid however the fact reains that we ended up paying  more than we expected We have requested a copy of the invoice since they did not given it to us and so far We have not received any acknoledgement nor a copy of the invoice I found this completely unacceptable and disgraceful bahaviour  I absolutely do not recommend this hotel  We do not trust this hotel and warn all travellers to be careful  
N => Travel agents beware As a travel agency owner for  years I want to make other agents aware of some problems you  encouterI made reservations for a group  rooms  months prior to this date and I accompanied the group  At the time I made the reservations they presented me with a standard reservation contract outlining the cancellation penalties showing my deposit and final payment due when we arrived  The website Amadeus reservation system as well as their manager at the time the reservationscontract was made assured me that they paid a travel agent commission  However the problems started as the trip got closer and the new manager informs me that because the standard contract made no specific mention of commission they owed none  I asked to speak to the owner quotDeborahquot who finally agreed to give me a small fraction of the actual amount due according to their website etc  as a gesture of good will  Then at the time for the final bill to be paid Deborah informs me that she will add   percent tax to the contract when no where on the contract is that mentioned and in fact each guest including myself received a statement saying  tax due was to be included in all inclusive feature  There is much more to this story   I could fill a book  As far as the property goes it is a very lovely mansion and could have been a pleasant experience if not for the owner  The manager Michael is very nice but clearly a manager in name only   all isions come from Deborah and there is no discussion with her   she will adhere to the contract when it is in her favor and not adhere to it when she wants to add tax  She actually told me to take the entire group and leave with no refunds if we did not pay the tax which was not in the contract  The gourmet breakfast has been nothing more that a casserolefruit and a bagel or croissant and if you are a group who likes to eat together there are not enough seats for everyone limited number of coffee cupssilverware etc  Most mornings we had to wait until they washed more coffee cups and service was terrible There is no one on premises after pm so if you have problems you are on your own  Also beware of the cancellation penalties   they will stick to them even if you break your back   one of my clients actually did and they were holding him accountable for the entire  nights   After I found another couple to take their place I finally managed to get Deborah to agree to refund the original person but it was not easy nor pleasant All things considered DONT use this property   I will not ever book it again P S  I also had a group of  rooms at the Hotel Monaco downtown   excellent hotelstaffetc  and I have heard from many who stayed there who have said it couldnt have been better Wonderful roomsgreat staff and terrific service Use them for your clients   you will save yourself a lot of grief and you will get paid for your services 
N => Horrible What a terrible stay  There was no one around to help us at all  They did not offer us any food   no breakfast  There are no restaurants or businesses in the area  There are no cabs nearby  There is no elevator and we were on the rd floor  The service was nonexixtent  They did not clean our rooms or change the sheets for the  days we were there  we had to go into their cupbord to find some clean towels  Then they locked us out  They had  day old newspapers and old magazines to read  There was no room for any of my things in the bathroom with just a pedistal sink and shower stall  The furnace was very loud and woke me up every  minutes  The staff could not even find us a blanket when we asked for it  We had to beg to have our garbage emptied  We were not informed before or during our stay that children were not allowed  Make sure that you do not bring any kids because they will charge you for their  rugs if you spill anything on them  It is not close to the airport or downtown  Please stay somewhere else  
N => Choose a hotel closer to the heart of the City Although beautifully appointed it seemed to be more about look than comfort  The bathrooms had little room for toiletries and there was only lukewarm water in the shower  Our window only had partial drapes so when the sun came up we were obliged to follow The food was mediocre Staff was attentive but inexperienced  It was virtually impossible to get a cab into downtown  Not as quothandyquot to the Loop as theyd like you to think Not a good place for groups  
N => A wonderful experience This gorgeous restored mansion was an truly wonderful experience  I am a frequent traveler and and this has to be the most wonderful night I ever spent on the road  The staff was excellant and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a unique stay at a beautiful landk  It was recommended to me by a business associate  You must really experience it to appreciate it  
N => Wheeler Mansion   Bad Customer Service Im a frequent traveler to Chicago and have stayed at many of the downtown hotels  The Wheeler Mansion gets my vote for the worst customer service in the city  A few warnings to potential guestsMake sure you are certain about your plans before making reservations  The Wheeler Mansion requires  days yes  days notice to cancel a reservation  Even if you call within  minutes of making your reservation they wont cancel Dont expect to get a cab outside the hotel  Its best to walk the two blocks to McCormick Center  The front desk will call a cab for you but it  take  or more minutes to arrive Dont expect a positive response from the employees if anything goes wrong  The night I stayed at the Wheeler Mansion the heat wasnt working in my room  After repeated calls to the answering service no one was actually in the office after pm the room was still about  degrees  The front desk clerk in the morning advised quottheres nothing I can do I just work herequot  Net net nice furniture lots of attitude and the customer is not their highest priority  
N => OK hotel This is a nice cozy hotel in lincoln park suburbs of chicago It has a old european style looks and style the washroom was small and the bath tub drain was not opening so water was holding up in the tub You can hear people walking updown the stairs as my room was just next to the staircase  
N => Nice hotel would return Nice hotel great location minutes away from the Magnificent Mile  Our rooms were nice and big deluxe room and the only thing I could really complain about was the noise of the ambulances at night but that is just due to the proximity of the hotel to the hospital  Our room was on the th floor so the noise wasnt terrible but I could definitely hear them at night however they did not keep me up I was just awake when they passed by others in my party didnt know what I was talking about the next morning when I asked about it they slept through the night with no problems  It was also a little annoying that you had to enter the hotel and then take one set of elevators to get to the main floor where the other set of elevators were located to take you to your rooms  But overall a very enjoyable stay friendly staff nothing of note to complain about  I would definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Chicago   
N => Great location but made to feel we did not belong Took our family to Chicago for a short sightseeing trip in ober  Stayed at Wyndham for  nights in two rooms  Upon arrival our booking was messed up to the point that we were given the keys to someone elses room  Going back to the desk did not even prompt an apology Throughout front desk treated us as if we werent good enough  As a By Request member I had expected a very different treatment  Value was sadly lacking and prices for parking or breakfast were outrageous when staff were more busy talking to one another than attending to clients  
N => Fantastic Location  you just cant beat it We stayed for  nights amp got what we felt after staying to be an excellent deal via hotwire com for pn  Ive go to say  I was alittle concerned amp apprehensive about staying here thanks to all the other reviews amp peoples honesty about the place  We are Aussies and arrived earlyam having travelled approx  hrs  Firstly Check in is not on the ground floor you need to take the lift up a floor  We were greeted by a friendly gentleman amp explained why we were here early  He actually asked if we wanted a high or lower floor  I was quotarmed with all the reviews quotdontsquot so I was prepared to arguefight to get a room on a higher floor so no noise amp we could sleep  He offered us a room on the th floor with a king bed so we took it  I didnt have to say a word   he must have sensed I was well prepared amp very jetlagged so dont argue with a tired Aussie Unfortunately our room wouldnt be ready until pm but he suggested we come back at  pm amp theyd see what they could do  The gentleman recognised us straight away amp advised our room was ready  The room was clean tidy with a limited view amp the bed was very comfortable  The best part was   we DIDNT HEAR any sirens from the ambulances at the hospital  The hotel doesnt have a pick up service amp no free Internet  Secondly The location was great   easy walk to Michigan Ave the Magnificent Mile Navy Pier etc we walked everywhere amp there is a tourist information just up the road near the Water Tower  Shopping is on your doorstep amp there are some great restaurants so venture out as we didnt eat in the hotel  It wasnt windy at all for early t amp we went Chicago Beach for lunch where there is a great caferestaurant right on the beach  If you get a sunny day its excellent down there  a good feed amp some cold beers made us feel at home  except no waves at the quotbeachquot  The moral to this story is   if you get a higher floor you wont hear the sirens  If you are a light sleeper Id consider elsewhere  Or just take a gamble like we did as it was only for  nights  
N => Good Jog My elderly relatives visited us from abroad  They got here a day ahead of schedule and my wife booked them into the Wyndham Chicago  They spoke no English  My wife called ahead to tell the desk to expect them  When my relatives arrived the front desk took care of them without any trouble  A nice hotel to be sure but it was the extra effort that impressed me and my relatives  Thanks guys  
N => Fantastic Chicago stay Our hotel stay was fantastic  Service and the staff was very friendly  The room was very clean  We recommend this hotel  Very good location  
N => Staff great   rooms need a little work Our experience at the Wyndham was mixed  The Staff could not have been nicer particularly at check in where we were upgraded to an executive suite instead of the ior suite we were expecting  However our particular room although very large looked very worn  The upholstery on some of the chairs was torn and faded the wood on the tables were scratched and dented   it all looked like it had been purchased in a garage sale  The room was in need of refurbishing  Because of the size of the room we had two arate AC systems and one of the two units did not work engineering said it needed a new fan  In general our stay was OK but it certainly did not have a feeling of luxury   PS on the same trip we stayed at the downtown Hilton in St  Louis and it was incredible   no comparison in the quality of the rooms even though the Hilton was a standard room and the Wyndham was an executive suite  
N => Worst customer service ever I recently had an incident at this hotel where they shut down their bar with large groups in house and no notification of their bar hours  In the heart of Chicago on a busy weekend with the Air and Water Show and you couldnt get a drink  The manager on duty Sheila seemed inexperienced as a manager and was clearly not customer oriented which was obvious with her rude demeanor  She told us to go somewhere else  Obviously revenue isnt important to this hotel during a recession nor is good customer service  I have also stayed at this hotel previously where our room wasnt ready requests for towels and coffee were ignored  They do not measure up the Wyndham standards of service  
N => Great Hotel w a Great Price  We stayed Saturday   Monday    at the Wyndham in Chicago  It was GREAT  We got a deal through travelzoo for  per night upgrade to a jr suite and free breakfast buffet for each morning  This was an amazing deal We got the top floor corner suite and it was great  The view was nice and the bed comfy  Cant say enough about the staff  They were great from the restaurant to the conceirge to the front desk  We came in early and our room was not ready so we left our luggage which was no problem  This was our first trip to Chicago and i would recommend taking a map everywhere you go and asking for directions as its a bit confusing becaue the streets are named and not numbered like nyc  The concierge recommended a fabulous restaurant Piccolo Signo for our first night and it was GREAT  moderately priced and you MUST sit outside to get the full affect  priily italian food  it was really great  The breakfast buffet was very good  all you can eat scrambled eggs fruit potatoes yogurt oatmeal cereal bacon etc  we had no problems and no complaints at this hotel  I would definately stay again  it is super close to michigan ave and close to other sites  You can hear the noise from the hospital outside but it did not bother us to much  One thing we did for our stay i would not recommend was the Adler Planetarium  Personally it was not worth the  admission for the two of us  The exhibit was soso and we saw the D show and i would not reccomend it  Especially for kids  I was bored and Im not   Overall though I recommend Chicago and this hotel highly  Others in our group paid close to  per night for the omni which was literally  mins walk from the wyndham  We got a great deal and were treated very nicely at the Wyndham  
N => Not as nice as I thought it would be  I really had high expectations when booking the Wyndham  The room was too small for us with  small kids  There was sand on the chairottoman  The bathroom was very clean so that was a plus  The pool was a lot smaller than I figured it would be and the water was freezing cold  The concierge desk had  girl working it and it was always overcrowded with people waiting to talk to her so that wasnt very helpful  Parking was more expensive than anticipated also   night  You could save  by parking yourself but goodluck finding a spot  The location was great  block off the Magnificent Mile  All in all the hotel was quotokayquot but I didnt think it was fantastic  I would stay there again if we had a discounted rate but would never stay there for the full price rate   definitely not worth the money  
N => Nice hotel Very nice place  Centrally located to all the Chicago attractions  Wish they had a pool though  
N => The staff made the difference Our twin dhters just turned  so we took them to Chicago for a shopping trip on the Miracle Mile and we stayed at the Windham We booked our room through Travelocity but were offered an upgrade to a suite for a price when we checked in  It was well worth the money for the extra space  The quotsuitequot wasnt the most impressive Ive ever stayed in but it was nice enough  With so many hotels to choose from it must be hardexpensive to keep things up to date  The TVs for example were a smaller tube type while many places offer larger flat pannels these days However it wasnt the room that made our stay so great it was the staff  Every time we came in we were greeted with large smiles by the desk staff  Our requests for extra towels and pillows were answered promptly and curteously  And Kaitlyn the concierge was extremely helpful and even had a treat sent up to our room when she heard it was the girls birthday  Whatever theyre paying her they should raise it as she was very good to us and always eager to help us make plans Definitely a large thumbs up  You might get a slightly better room somewhere else but you wont find a more curteous staff and that can make all the difference  
N => Great place to stay in Chicago Weve been to Chicago several times but this was our first stay at the Wyndham  The room rate during spring break was under  which was awesome  We loved the location being so close to Michigan Ave  We were allowed to upgrade our room upon check in and were even given the lower online rate  We needed a roll away bed which was given to us at no charge  The corner king room that we had was very spacious for a family of   The concierge was very helpful in recommending places for lunch  Overall the staff were very gracious  The hotel bar was very comfortable for relaxing after a day of shopping  I think this will be our hotel of choice for future trips to Chicago  
N => Solid Performer Wife and I stayed for one night  everything we expected  Room was comfortable and in good shape  Bathroom was well appointed  Bar was nice  Nothing really spectacular but more than met our needs  Light sleepers  not like location due to frequent sirens from ambulances going to Northwestern Hospital located across the street otherwise the location is excellent  Would definitely stay here again especially for less than  a night  
N => Fantastic Took my son for his first trip to a big city all I can say is I could not believe how friendly and helpful everyone was  Needed to leave luggage before check in and after check out we used amtrak no problem  Needed directions for everything concierge young lady with beautiful smile could not have been more helpful and we asked a lot of questions Room was large and comfortable and clean  Will stay again when we come back  
N => Great location  but uncomfortable beds  Overall the hotel was nice and clean with good service  The location was fantastic right next to North Michigan Ave  the magnificent mile and all its fabulous shops  The pool was rather small but good enough to keep our son happy  As far as parking the nearby parking garage is much cheaper than valet at thirty four dollars per night  On the bad side the view was the side of a building  but it didnt matter to us since we didnt spend much time in the room  The room was small and it was a bit noisy due to the sirens due to the nearby hospital  The worst thing was the quality of the mattresses  My husband and I did not sleep well and woke up with neck and backaches  If it werent for the uncomfortable beds I would rate this hotel a   
N => A Winnner at the right price Invaluable Staff A   I used Trip Advisor to find my family a great hotel for our first visit to Chicago Wyndham Chicago passed with flying colours We used the website to get reservations spoke a few times to get an internet rate and once I had a guy who was a loser on the phone rude and I felt I was a bother to him  He did not represent the Wyndham the way they deserve I am sure he is an unhappy person quotHappy Up Bill quot I am told reservation phone staff isnt even located in the USA Our room was huge front desk upsized the room suite free due to having two small children her name was Daneen and was absolutely great each day she wore a genuine smile  She asked daily how everything was If a had to criticize it would be two things parking price   each  hours and breakfast price at  or  al a carte is not even a conciderationouch when travelling with spouse and kids The location is second to none safe clean and anything you want close by the city blocks are small and can be walked in   minutes Others here have commented on noise from the hospital nearby and I will say no trouble at all our stay was not affected at all and our room did face to hospital  I would suggest to anyone that wants a great hotel and save a buck get a breakfast plan and park your own vehicle to save Valet charges I would stay again at the wonderful Chicago Wyndham Thanks to all the Staff  
N => Nighte several times over Reservations made months in advance  Pre arranged for electric water kettle microwave or some other source of heating water in my room  Could not use the coffee maker to run water through for heating the water would taste and smell like coffee  It wasnt there and the desk refused to be of assistance in correcting the situation No quotBy Requestquot gift basket upon arrival as promissed and as I always receive at other Wyndhams even in the smallest towns When they refused to correct the situation I tried to leave and they charged my card for a  day stay  The front desk person made up lies telling me she spoke to her manager  When I used my cell phone to call the main number I was told the manager was not there that day  The lies continued and even though I was able to find a great hotel to go to Wyndham Chicago tied up my credit card so that it took about  hours to get checked in to another hotel  Then when I tried to check out  days later Wyndham Chicago charged my account again for a  day stay so that I had problems checking out of my hotel  I wasted several hours and lots of roaming charges on my phone trying to get it straightened out  After returninig home Im still having issues with them Stay Away I recommend the Hotel Rafaello  I went there and they were much more accommodating a very comfortable suite a fridge amp microwave and I paid night less than I did for the tiny room with no view at the Wyndham  
N => Super Service We just stayed at the Wyndham for two nights  We take the Amtrak to Chicago once a year and pick different hotels looking for great locations and good deals  I missed a deal at another hotel by not booking when I saw it and boy am I glad I did  Even though I paid about  more per night at the Wyndham it was well worth the money  We had booked a corner king room with a sofa  They gave us a complimentary refrigerator upon booking  When we arrived pm late at night the check in was smooth and he said he wanted to give us an upgrade for more room with the two kids  We said okay  The room was awesome  We had a view that was not just a building next door  We had an executive suite  Two rooms with a king bed and pull out sofa with a door inbetween  The room was so spacious and we didnt feel trapped in it like we have in the past with some hotel rooms  The service was impeccable  Every time we turned around someone was there to help  Russell the concierge was extremely helpful and saved us  dollars on taxis by giving us explicit bus directions  He gave us a card for Ed Debevics that gave us a small scoop sundae and free souveniour  Catelyn tried to help us with getting desert but the line at the suggested restaurant was too long  The hotel restaurant gave the kids free sundaes while we had cheesecake in a quiet atmosphere  There is so much to say but the best word is EXCELLENTI would stay here again without question  
N => Friendly staff   Good location   But Small rooms The location of this hotel is near perfect just one block off Michigan Avenue  From the outside the hotel looked impressive and the ground floor foyer and nd floor reception area felt the same  The reception staff on checking in were extremely friendly and our room was available at am in the morning even though check in was not until pm Our room was clean and nicely furnished with a huge comfortable bed but was far smaller that expected  I think its one of the smallest hotel rooms I have been in for a good while  Our view was of a brick wall so we had total privacy The room along with the rest of the hotel was quite cold we managed to get the heating up in the room eventually but the rest of the public corridors just felt to chilly for comfort  On another negative note there was little in the way of public areas it just felt as though this was purely a business hotel where you could just eat drink and sleep  Only a handful of seats in reception Breakfast the next morning cost  plus tax per person  The breakfast was nice but really not worth the money  Personally in hindsight we  have been better off at the Starbucks around the corner To sum in up nice clean hotel friendly staff great location near to Michigan Ave the ambulance sirens for the near by hospital do seem to be constant day and night but with compact rooms  Pleased that I stayed here but I think for our next visit to Chicago in spring we will try another hotel  
N => Horrible I was not impressed with this hotel other than its location  If you have any expectations or need service dont stay here  The bellman will get you in the door and just point to the elevator leaving you to get your bags and family upstairs to check in  Then you wait ours was hrs and hope you get a room that you can rest in  There is a hospital across the street with ambulances running non stop  
N => Read on    I booked this room through Priceline  Why would anyone pay    tax when on Priceline you can get a four star room for   tax for this hotel I checked into this hotel on a Thursday night I arrived at the hotel counter only to find the hotel attendant on a personal phone call he neither smiled at me nor did he end his conversation for quite some time  After a while all he said was sorry in a neutral tone I proceeded to ask for a king size bed instead of two double beds and was told that none was available  Incidently when I went to ask the hotel attendant recommendations for restaurants in the area he told me to ask the concierge without even realizing that no one was staffed at the concierge desk  I was disappointed that I was given the room right next to the elevator especially when young children screamed nonstop in the elevator lobby when I was attempting to sleep  It goes to say that I did not exactly have a peaceful nights sleep in this hotel  Whats more is that there was some rattling noise from the air conditioning  I set the room to a comfortable  degrees however the level of noise was annoying especially when you are trying to sleep For a four star room the beds were not as comfortable as they should be  They seemed to be quotover used quot As for the furniture most of it seemed worn even if it would considered to be elegant  I was also disappointed that the televisions were not plasma screens  The bathroom however was wonderful  Granite counters spacious floor plan quotspaquot toiletries and a nice shower system helped to counter the problems with the room  Overall I would stay here again if I can get the Priceline rate  Otherwise I would not 
N => Timeshare scam warning After staying at this Hotel we were lured into buying into a timeshare promo with Wyndham Vacations  We got a call after a couple months asking how we enjoyed our stay  They took  from us  I called  days later to get our money back  We did not get our money back and amazingly there is no record of my call  They refuse to give me back my   I have gone as high as the corporate office and have filed a complaint with the Missouri Attourney Generals office  There are multiple complaints against Wyndham Vacations Stay away 
N => Nice Clean No views Booked two nights for short family trip to explore City  Location great except for hospital next door drew a contant flow of ambulances sirens  Hotel very clean room was nice  ble bathrooms granite tops  Exterior windows dirty and really no good views  We changed rooms shortly after check in but second room view wasnt any better  Food price really expensive but found serveral reasonable resturants nearby  WEST EGG was favorite Oh the pool      was about the size of a standard hotel room but kids didnt seem to mind  Bar made great cozmos  Youll drop  for two with tip  OuchNo frig in room made bringing resturant leftovers back impossible  Over all OK but I will try another place next time  
N => Pleasant Experience   Wyndham Just got back today from a  day stay in Chicago  We switched our hotel last minute to the Wyndham based on a good rate from Expedia and the fact that my  year old insisted on a pool  The hotel check  in was very easy although we were told at check in that they could not honour our Wyndham By Request membership since we had booked through Expedia  The front desk however was nice enough to give us a quotclub roomquot on the th floor without the benefits of the club services  We found the room to be more than adequate  It appeared to have new carpet  double beds with duvet bedding and a small tv  Being that we were there during Spring Break the hotel was packed with other families and the pool was jammed with kids   much to my chagrin  however to my kids delight  I think my ears are still ringing with the sound of kids screaming and the roar of the jacuzzi Our concierge quotRussellquot was very helpfull with suggestions  TIP If you plan to go to the Rain Forest Cafe make sure to phone in advance reservations Playing it by ear cost us   hours of wait time Overall  we found the hotel to be nice enough to return and more than deserving of their   star rating  We did not eat breakfast in the cafe instead used the miniscule coffee maker to heat water for our instant oatmeal and hot cocoa  nd note the club floor bathrooms must be designed for very tall people  My  year old couldnt reach the bathroom sink  Luckily she has great balance so we inverted the plastic trash can and used it as a step stoolquot  We also loved the shampoos and soaps provided by the hotel  I also liked the make up mirror in the bathroom  My kid thought the first floor lobby was very fancy   although from a space planning point it seems inefficient since you either have to climb the grand stairs or take an elevator to get to the lobby Our overall experience was lovely and we would recommend this Wyndham Hotel  
N => Nice place in convenient location The Wyndham is vey well located near Magnificient Mile and not far even walking from a lot of places of interest Staying several days in  bedrooms we were updated to huge comfortable suites  But it would have been OK anyway for the internet price we had got However the fan in the bedroom is a bit noisy  be to hide traffic noises especially to the adjacent Northwestern hospital  On th floor traffic noise is not a problem   We dit not try the restaurants but there is a Corner Bakery a Subway etc just at the door and close other restaurants 
N => Good Location We went to Chicago for New Years and had a great time the hotel was close and walkable distance to shops and restaurants The staff was very friendly and they gave us a nice room according to all our requests  Overall it was a great stay  
N => Could be better could be worse I got a great deal at Wydhams site and their pictures looked amazing  We called a day ahead of time and told them we were requesting early check in and they said they would have the room ready by  am  We arrived at noon and were greeted by some snotty young woman in her early s who informed us that we were quotlied toquot and that all check ins were at  no exceptions  I was quite taken back at her      attitude but didnt let her get under my skin   We came back at  and they informed us that our room was given away and the only room was available was a handicapped room that was significantly smaller than what we booked  Not knowing what I know now I took the room   The room was small and not exactly upscale from what their photos portrayed at their site  The furniture was demolished and looked like it was hit by many a wheelchair  The bathroom was huge but the accessible bars were loose and got in our way  Outraged we switched rooms the second night to what we were supposed to have and enjoyed the rest of our stay  Other than the room snafu it was a very good hotel  
N => Nice Stay at the Discounted Price My  year old dhter and I stayed at the Wyndham Chicago    We booked through Priceline about two months in advance and got an awesome rate  night  After booking our room I immediately signed up to be a quotWyndham by requestquot member so that our stay would be extra special  Upon arrival to the hotel however I quickly learned that despite my quotby requestquot membership I was instead going to forever be quotthe guest who paid through Priceline quot This was pointed out to me by more than one Wyndham employee very politely       like I needed reminding or something  Because of the way we booked we were denied all of the perks that other quotby requestquot members automatically received  In addition I saw that all of the other guests were enjoying complimentary breakfasts at the hotels buffet   but not us  That being said I crunched the numbers and discovered that even if we had purchased each of the extras that were complimentary to other quotby requestquot members we would have still come out ahead by booking through Priceline  The upside We stayed on the th floor facing west which was nice since the hospital and all of the emergency sirens were on the north side across the street  The room was surpisingly large with an oversized bathroom  Very nice The bed linens were oh so comfy  The housekeeping staff was prompt and efficient  The hotel lobby was beautiful with a winding staircase leading to the check in desk on the nd floor  All in all it was a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing environment  The downside The carpet in our room was wrinkling poor installation and the TV looked older than my  discount store no name cheapie  The rooms walls didnt block alot of noise from adjacent rooms  The work out room on the th floor was small and had bad views of nearby rooftops  The pool was teeny tiny be  x    about the size of two lap lanes at my community center  The hot tub was average size  Due to the crowds we didnt use any of these amenities The Wyndham is located just one block from the Magnificant Mile shopping corridor super convenient  We were walking distance from everything  We would shop then swing by the hotel to drop off our stuff and shop some more  We were a  minute walk from the Navy Pier tourist trap and a  minute bus ride from the The Chicago Institute of Art must see  I found the Wyndham was an affordable way to enjoy Chicago during a very busy time of year courtesy of Priceline  It was a pleasant hotel with a great location  But if someone wanted to visit Chicago and was willing to pay top dollar regular rates I would strongly suggest staying somewhere else  The Wyndham was worth what I paid which is why I gave it  stars  If Id paid the going rate though I would have felt I paid too much and would given it a  star rating  
N => Looks nice but I never stayed there they just charged me for the room I made a reservation here and ended up finding a better deal elsewhere so I called not once but twice to cancel my reservation  When I called the second time to cancel I was told by the front desk that I did have a reservation only to be told by the reservation person that no in fact my reservation had been cancelled and I was all set  A week later the room charge showed up on my credit card statement  I called the hotel and after being given the run around by both the front desk and the reservation line I was transferred to the accounting department where I have since left  unreturned voicemail messages about having the charge removed  Dispicable customer service from what otherwise seems like a reputable hotel  They need to get their act together and coordinate their computer systems or something  
N => one of the nicer hotels Ive stayed in for the price My boyfriend and I ided to go to chicago on a whim  We had like  days to get all our booking in order  We took the train to get there and booked through priceline to get our hotel  We were very happy and surprised with the size and quality of the room from what we paid per night   There was a huge sitting room living room then another set of doors and a bedroom  I was concerned from my researching before we went that the hospital next door was going to be a down fall to this hotel  But we were soo active that we were at the hotel for only sleeping and like a quick change through out the day  We both heard like one siren but nothing normal people couldnt handle  We slept well and really loved the room we did ided one day to try to incorperate the pool in but we went down and turned around and went right back to our room changed and went to a bar the pool was lhable it was tiny and it had like  kids in it so it wasnt worth even trying to go in But we didnt go for the pool we went for sightseeing so the Wyndham really fit our trip well o 
N => LOVED the Wyndham My husband and I just got back from a  day stay in Chicago at the Wyndham  This was our first trip to Chicago and we were celebrating our th Wedding Anniversary  I had read over  reviews before we left so when we arrived I was not sure what to expect since I had read both positive and negative reviews From the minute we parked to the time we checked out I can honestly say our trip was awesome  The entire staff we had contact with was excellent  They were very friendly professional efficient and helpful  Our room was very clean and had everything we needed  Im not sure where all of the negative comments came from that were in the reviews  We were pleasantly surprised and our trip was absolutely perfect We will go back to Chicago and when we do we will return to the Wyndham Melissa S    Indiana 
N => Management unconcerned by theft at the hotel We had a terrible weekend at the Wyndham Chicago  Our room was not ready and we were asked to leave our bags with the bellhops  One bag was locked  Two hours later on our return the bellhop handed us the padlock arately from the suitcase saying that the lock was found on the floor next to the cases in the storage area  When we got to our room we found that there was a ring missing from the suitcase that had been returned to us unlocked and immediately contacted hotel security  No one was interested in the situation and there was no evidence of any action or investigation  We had to chase the front desk manager Tony many times and there was no proactive follow up or contact by anyone  The following day we spoke directly to one of the bellhops who had been on duty at our arrival and he was totally unaware of what had happened suggesting that there was no investigation taking place  There was also no apology or empathy toward the situation  Even worse it was strongly suggested that I had mislaid the ring and that it was my fault although everyone agreed that it was strange that the bag was returned to me unlocked even though it had been locked when it was given to the bellstaff The hotel management did not seem surprised that something was stolen and stated that no missing item had ever been recovered in the hotel s history  A message was left for the general manager to contact us but he never returned our call  This type of event thieving lack of response etc must happen often at the Wyndham Chicago because no one was at all concerned or alarmed  Far more upsetting than the ring being stolen it did not have great monetary or sentimental value is the total lack of response concern apology or empathy demonstrated by the Wyndham Chicago management Prior to our arrival the Wyndham Chicago had given us the wrong type of room and when I rang up to have this situation corrected the reservations agent insulted me and then hung up This should have been a warning to us  Dont stay at this hotel  Its location does not compensate or excuse the appalling attitude towards theft or customers  
N => If you want to sleep   go elsewhere We arrived   then Wyndham early and told that our room was ALMOST ready  Check in is at    so we came back      they sent us right to our room   which was being cleaned and we were asked to wait outside  Nope   I went down to the front desk and asked for another room  They agreed and sent us to ANOTHER room  Upon entering this room we were able to hear the ENTIRE conversation of the group next door as if they were in the same room SO I called the front desk and asked if this was normal and was told yes since the rooms were adjoining we would be able to hear some noise  I asked to be moved   they obliged and sent us back to the OTHER room    which was now ready  WhewCome bedtime wow     beds are springy and bouncy like something in a Best Western  My son who is  and can sleep on anything spent night   on the floor  We moved to the Hilton for the rest of our stay  On a positive note     the food at the restaraunt was GREAT as was the service  
N => A smoky stay  To outward appearances its a nice hotel  A  star at best  Probably more of a solid  star  And I stayed there for business so I didnt go by choice  Fortunately I was given a huge suite sadly it was a smoking room  When I asked for something else I was told that was all they had and it was very likely not too bad  I took her at her word and tried the room but frankly I didnt get past the elevator before hitting a lung choking wall of smoke  The room itself wasnt bad but it wasnt acceptable either  I then easily got a non smoking room from another clerk huh and while the hallways on the non smoking floor were STILL smoky the room was okay  I guess my long winded point is to make SURE you get a non smoking room  
N => Great Location Room was nice view was not  We were in a corner room but view was shaded by adjacent buildings  When we checked in the front desk computers were down so they wrote my name credit card number on a sticky note and added it to the pile of other peoples numbers  Room could have been cleaner When I contacted the concierge to plan a night out they were not really familiar with the area and were of no help The hotel is in a great location near a lot of shopping and public transportation Overall the stay was good and I would return to this property  
N => Unsatisfactory Customer Service I have not stayed in the hotel due to my flight to Chicago being cancelled but one thing is for sure the customer service is the worst and I have traveled quite a bit There were no problems getting a reservation but on the day of my travel I found out that my flight was cancelled and I called the hotel to let them know that I wont be coming  Unfortunately I didnt get the name of the person with whom I spoke but she had told me that as long as I fax them a statement with USAir logo that my flight was cancelled they wont charge me and so I didnt request the cancellation number Later when I spoke to the accounting department the accountant have told me that I would need either a cancellation number or a statement from the airline  When I finally got the statement and faxed it to them she refused to refund the  due to the fact that I didnt have the cancellation number and outright lied to me saying that they never said that the statement from the airline would be satisfactory  when I asked to speak to the supervisor the accountant refused to connect me to anybody stating that no one can help me  When I called the corporate headquarters they told me that this matter is up to the hotel to resolve  As a result  was charged to my card  But the worst part is the hotel staff lied to the customer 
N => Woudnt Do It Again I had a unique situation   flew a redeye from Seattle and needed a hotel to nap and clean up before a later morning busines meeting  Wyndham offered a great rate  I showed up at  am to the followinggtNo front desk staff  I could hear them in the office but it took a few quotgood morningsquot before anyone bothered to come out gtWhen I tried to check in they said quotwe dont offer the thing youre talking about  check in is  pm quot When I showed my confirmation they informed me that they were sold out and had no rooms  When I said I had a confirmation I got a shrug gtFinally the manager came out and said the same thing  I again showed my confirmation number  She asked me to wait and disappeared  Came back  mins later and checked me in  But wasnt really pleasant about it When I got to the room it had obviously just been made up so they get a point for finding me something  The room itself wasnt special which was fine because I wasnt staying long Based on my experience I wont stay there on my next trip which will be longer than a few hours  And I sure wont try the day rate thing again  
N => Great price for a very nice hotel We booked through Travelocity for a  night stay in mid   The rate was   per night for a Sat  Sun night stay  We ended up paying an extra  a night upfront to upgrade to a suite  the room was HUGE  It must have been about   sq ft  It was very nice and the bed was quite comfy  Staff was helpful  Would definately stay here again  Located only about a block off the heart of Michigan Ave  
N => Wyndham is nice but too pricey Stayed in standard room which was clean but no amenities  Alot of street noise sirens all night hospital is closeby  I was surprised that they put a   gratuity on our bar tab and also slipped in a few drinks that were not ours  Lesson learned is to pay cash in the bar next time and give a gratuity if you want to  They charge for absolutely everything even local calls  I doubt we go there again after seeing our bill  They offer nothing special for the cost  
N => Enjoyed the Wyndham I booked the American Girl package and stayed a  days  Now our room was a ent size the carpet was dirty it really needed to be cleaned there were spills all over the floor the hotel internet service was awful not worth the     the wireless keyboard wouldnt work and I know how to use them properly  The food was limited in the hotel and a bit overpriced   you are already charged a delivery fee on top of a room service fee so tipping the room service person wasnt going to happen  There is no view the hotel is shorter than the surrounding buildings and Northwestern Hospital is right across the street   sirens through the night  The pool was small and not child friendly there is a ent workout room sauna and steamroom  It was okay but I expected more   I should have booked through Priceline  I wouldnt be so disappointed right now  
N => Lovely stay Had a lovely stay in this hotel  Staff were very friendly  The only problems i had were not being able to get late check outs as they were very full  Also the shuttle failed to pick me up from the Shopping Mall at the agreed time  Would go back  
N => Nice locationvery arrogant staff o k  I got a big deal with priceline  But all the employees gave me the feeling that I am not worth staying in such a location  The Bellman e g  did not accept a  tip  The Wyndham should not offer such good prices if they are not willing to welcome these kind of guests  
N => ent Stay Far from Subway For two nights last week e    it was an overall good stay  The check in was good quick and no mention of priceline which I used for this stay  Though I requested a high floor room I am sure I was given the typical priceline room which gives you a wonderful view of the wall of the other building  Of course the front desk person said the hotel is not that high    well whatever Major concern for elderly or those with disabilities It is considerable distance from the subway  I would recommend a hotel closer to Michigan Avenue of State Street if this is a concern  Otherwise walk it which I did No check out problems  At night there seemed to be this wierd occassional mechanical noise elevator related be coming from the hallway  I had to make some makeshift earplugs  This was the th floor I did not use the eating facilities  Internet was not a problem  Hope this helps 
N => Great Business Hotel Much nicer hotel than I expected  Some other Wyndham hotels are not up to this hotels standards  Only annoying part was having to take the elevatoror stairs to the lobby level and then a different elevator to the hotel room  Room was clean and well kempt  Service was average  Front desk staff was cool and indifferent  They did not offer any more information or suggestions than simply answering questions  Room service was quick but they came into the room to pick up the tray without knocking on the door  Internet access worked well for a fee  Great location for walking around and shopping  Would stay here again  
N => Not the greatest    I was excited to stay at the Wyndham because it seemed like a really nice hotel but it wasnt as great as I thought it would be  The building itself is beautiful and extremely clean  The valet and bellhops were really nice and pleasant  The hotel was not convenient because you had to take the elevator to the nd floor walk a bit to a next set of elevators and go to your rooms from there  The rooms were really nice I thought but the major problem we had was the heat  We were on the th floor and it was extremely hot in our room around  degrees  We tried to change it but it wouldnt work  We called the front desk and they talked to Maintenance and told us there is nothing we can do  It was a shame because the beds were heavenly The mattress was soo comfortable and so was the cover  But we could barely sleep because of the heat  The location was great and the staff was pleasant but the most important part of a hotel is when you sleep and we couldnt really do that cuz of the heat  
N => Wyndham was a Winning Experience     Chicago is my birthday present to myself each year  Husband amp I usually stay at Monaco but they waited way late to post ent rates so I ided to try the Wyndham  Since we know Chicago so well I knew the area was great and so was our experience at the Wyndham  Great customer follow up before and after our stay  Room was nice size and clean bath was nice and beds were comfortable  The only thing I missed was my usual view of the River but you can see a little of Lake Michigan  Would definitely stay at the Wyndham again  
N => Great Location We stayed at the Wyndham Chicago using the American Girl Package  Great location just off Michigan Ave  Very spacious rooms and elegant or throughout the hotel  On the negative side the front desk and concierge were not very helpful with a couple simple needs we had  We did have to listen to ambulances arriving at the hospital about every  minutes but I must admit I did not notice them much after midnight  Plus there is not much quotatmospherequot at the hotel  Its a place for business travelers  be this is expected on a weekday in ober  We did get a helpful rate but if we travel back to Chicago I wouldnt be opposed to staying here but Ill probably look around for a different place  
N => Great City Experience I enjoyed my  night stay at the Wyndham  The room was large comfortable with all of the usual amenities  Staff was efficient and pleasant  Check out was a breeze  There was a problem with my reservation but it was corrected quickly  Yes there was a lot of hustle bustle outside of the hotel but I took it as just the expected activity amp excitement of a downtown hotel in a big city  The location was perfect as attested to by other reviewers  Be prepared to share the hotel with plenty of little girls with their dolls Some locals told me the hotel restaurant is one of the best but I did not have the opportunity to eat there  I had just one problem which I seem to encounter too often so be its me     a dirty stained carpet  
N => Skeptical but loved the Wyndham My husband and I ided to surprise our dhter to a trip to Chicago mainly for the American Girl Place  We chose the Wyndham because of their AMG package which included a bathrobe and slippers for my dhters doll  The room was always clean and we are extremely picky in the cleanliness area We stayed at Le Meridien several months before and loved it However Le Meridien was   a night vs   for the Wyndham  We took our chances and were glad we did  Our dhter loved receiving chocolate chip cookies on arrival  We also were upgraded to a corner suite with a lake view free of charge because of the by request membership  We were even able to see the fire works from Navy Pier since we were there the week before the fourth of y  The by request manager Ana was amazing She always went the extra mile for us  Thank you Ana we will return to the Wyndham mainly because of your hospitality 
N => Extremely Disappointing Stayed there for  nights of a long trip and it was two of the worst nights sleep I ever encountered   the worst nights sleep being the Eastern Blackout a few years ago where it was over  degrees and the North had no power  The hotel was in good location to get to the trains so we could get to the White Sox and Cubs games  The walk was long but not too bad  The hotel was clean but it was ust and they did not have the AC working  With  people in a room on a hot ust night it gets stuffy and the first room we were in would not dip below  degrees  So they said it was fixed downstairs    no change  hours later  A staffer came up to look at the vents and said it was damaged but should be ok     no change  Got a different room the next night on a different wing of the hotel   same difference  It was deja vu  I have stayed in Wyndams all over and am a preferred member but this put a bad taste in my mouth  It was almost like they did not want to turn on the AC because they wanted to cut corners and save money  Valet parking was ok it just took  minutes to get to them  In front of the hotel is chaos with cars boxed in packed all over the place  They need organization  I would never stay in this hotel ever again in the Chicago area  Almost walked out to the Courtyard a block away    if I was alone I would have  
N => Great Location Average Room My husband and I stayed at the Wyndham for  nights in early e  while visiting our son who had been attending college in Chicago  I booked the special quotTake Your Dhter to Chicago   American Girl Packagequot which offered a rate of   a night for a standard room a  savings over the regular room rate  I booked a room with  double beds as we thought our son might want to stay with us  The package included a Wyndham bathrobe which fits an American Girl doll When I checked in I discovered that the hotel had changed our reserved room with  double beds to one with only a king sized bed because that was my preference when I joined Wyndham ByRequest  If we wanted our son to stay with us we had to pay a  a night fee for a rollaway bed  I was tired after driving almost  miles that day and didnt have the energy to protest  I did not get any kind of upgrade for being a ByRequest member although I did get a free small bottle of wine and a cheese and cracker snack Our room was on the th floor and was on the small side but was adequate  As a ByRequest member I did not have to pay the   fee for internet access  The room had a queen sized bed NOT the promised king sized bed a small sitting area with a chair and a desk and a refrigeratormini bar  It was clean and quiet I did hear a conversation from a guest in the next room but did not hear any street noise My son ided not to stay with us so I asked the front desk to remove the rollaway bed about an hour after it had been delivered  This was done promptly but when I checked out I was charged   for  nights use which I had to ask to be removed from the bill When we first went to our room around  pm there was a full bottle of beer in the hall by the door and there were dirty dishes and an empty beer box outside several other rooms which were not cleared until the next day  Housekeeping is quite slow on the second day of our stay our room was not cleaned until almost  pm The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of shopping and many area attractions  I highly recommend the delicious food at the Corner Bakery located across the street  Overall this hotel was fine but it is really not a  star hotel  I would stay here again if I got a good rate  
N => Designed as an Office Bldg  Looks like an office building feels like an office building and orginally it was built as an office building  This all around average hotel with average size rooms has a very commercial feel to it  Chicago is full of better choices  
N => Everyone else tried harder Parked and stayed at the Wyndham upon our return from Mexico  Our charter flight got in at  a m  on Sunday morning  I new in advance I would have to call the hotel upon touchdown in order to have the shuttle pick us up  It took  minutes and three phone calls to the hotel to finally have the shuttle pick us up  By that time the other hotels Ramada Hilton Holiday Inn etc  had already made multiple two and three round trips pick ups of travelers staying at those hotels  When our shuttle finally arrived there were a handful of men on the shuttle  who it turned out had no luggage  My guess is the shuttle service was being used to shuttle airport workers to and from the airport  Didnt look to me that it was on quotthe up and upquot  somebodies little sideline business  The excuse at the front desk upon arrival was quotwere running behindquot  what a crock of     Bottom line the Wyndham was not worth the price premium as compared to the other parksleepfly offerings  
N => Loud rooms Not a good hotel if you like to sleep at night  Noises ranged from conversations in the hall conversations of guests next door and ambulances going into the medical center across the street  Rooms were dark but clean  
N => Service not refelective of  star quality The accomodations were okay    clean and nice looking  However the service was just okay    something Id expect at a  star hotel not a  star  They dont allow early check ins and check in is not until  p m  and they dont allow late check outs all we needed was  minutes  The valet service is really slow and expensive    I have stayed in Chicago a number of times and usually pay  and here it was   Like I said the stay was okay but Id rather pay less at a  star hotel and expect that kind of service rather than pay for a  star hotel and get  star service  Also we had to pay for phone calls I have never expericenced having to pay for a    in my hotel room  It was   for the first ten minutes and then we had to pay   for every ten mintues after that  Ridiculous Nothing they did was really wrong per se   but they just dont do anything to go out of their way to make you feel appreciated for your business  If they dont value me as a customer Id rather go elsewhere 
N => Contrasting Experience The facility itself was very nice and quietly comfortable  But some widely varying service created feelings of uneasiness during our two day stay  Upon arriving the bell person started the unpleasantness by stating that if we did not like the unreasonably high valet parking charge that we just self park our car  Unfortunately this was neither realistic or thoughtful given that the self parking was located over a block away and the weather was windy with a below zero wind chill  Then a friendly and courteous front desk person and concierge warmed us up  But we were let down again by poor room service and several brusque unfriendly hotel employees  Perhaps we had just set our expectations too high over Christmas  
N => Not So Great My husband and I stayed at the Wyndham this past weekend and were disappointed with the hotel accomodations and service  We frequently travel around the USA and typically stay in upper class hotels at least  times a year  Unfortunately this was our worst experience of the year  We were driving from Michigan when we called the hotel to ask about parking facilities  We were told that only valet parking was available and then the lady rudly hung up the phone  Upon entering the hotel the lobby was small and the carpeting was a bit ragged  Our room though it was a ior suite had no more extras then a regular room except for square footage yet it cost  more per night  It was poorly lit and right across from the hospital which I had specifically requested we not be located  As soon as we walked into our room I contacted the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do about our location and appologized  The next day my husband and I went shopping and came back early evening AFTER our room was cleaned  As we were resting in our room a hotel employee opened our door and walked in they did not even knock We were very disappointed and for the money we spent we could have stayed in a MUCH nicer place  To top it all off the hallways were caked with dust along the edges of the floor and desperately needed to be vacuumed  Being a partner in the hotels preferred guest program did not seem to help  We have had MUCH better experiences at other Wyndham hotels and frequently stay at one in Texas  However next time we are in Chicago we will take our money and ourselves to another place 
N => OK hotel  nothing great A previous reviewer mentioned the hospital across the street and sirens  That was an understatement ALL NIGHT LONG we were awakened by sirens  The emergency entrance to the hospital is across the street from the hotel  The room was good size but the bathroom was in major need of a good cleaning  Thankfully I got a great rate on Priceline or I would be requesting my money back 
N => Inconsistant service Got our room from priceline for   The rooms are nicer than Hyatt Regency for half the cost  We upgraded regular room to an executive suite for  extra per night  Rooms were clean and quiet although the rooms are starting to show a little wear  However you should know that they dont treat guest that book rooms online through sites like hotwire or priceline very well  I dont know how many times we heard the words quotSorry but because you booked on priceline   quot Also the valet was not very good  We patiently waited an hour for our car while another guest screamed his head off at the head valet for not having his car out within  minutes  He of course got comped valet right away  We had to struggle for ours  So if you have a problem here dont be nice about it  Scream yell and make a fool of yourself to be treated as a guest  
N => Nice Hotel We ided to quotstep upquot to a better hotel than the standard Holiday Inn while taking the kids to Chicago for a few days  We signed up for the quotBy Requestquot service ahead of time which got us a free upgrade to a ior suite and other personalized amennities  The location was great and close to shoppingdining  Navy pier and the museums were only a   cab ride  Valet service is an extra night and since there is really no public parking add that to your room rate  Youll get unlimited use of your car but youll need to let them know   minutes ahead of time  The pool was small but the kids didnt care  
N => It was okay Stayed  nights Sun  thru Thurs  at the Wyndham  Location was close and convenient to Mich  Ave  shopping and many restaurants  Corner Bakery across street for breakfast was great  The room was nice but we had some plumbing problems which required maintenance to visit our room daily the first three days  Housekeeping was prompt with requests for extra towels  Check in was interesting as the names and number of guests were never listed correctly for our room neither at check in nor upon check out despite a lengthy amount of time spent trying to correct this at the front desk  Nice amenities in bathroom soaps etc  Hot tub cap   and pool small  Did not try the restaurant inside the hotel but it has rave reviews  Bell services were very possessive about their carts  Would not let us use one to bring down our own luggage  Overall it was okay   would stay again with Priceline rate cant recall amount paid  
N => Weekend in Chicago We stayed at the Wyndham for a long weekend  The location is great and our room was clean but not much of a view  The only complaint was the hotel bar  Late at night it is terribly understaffed  It took a long time to get served  We ordered drinks and a snack a small pizza to share  The pizza was absolutely terrible  We ate very little of it  We might stay here again because of the location and the price was good but I would recommend eating somewhere else  
N => Great Location Booked through quikbook and so did not recieve Wyndham Request treatment  The bathrooms were large and clean everything in great condition  Location was prime and taxi amp shuttles easily found  Good eatery across the way  Did not have to wait long for elevators either  The only complaint was not enough items stocked for the number in each room and number of beds requested not met   
N => As good as everyone says First class all the way  Join the quotBy Requestquot program for little extras including room upgrade when available  The room we has was huge and the location is excellent  Service from the valet to the concierge was outstanding  Good rates available on their Web site  Our King Suite was less than  per night 
N => Great location My dhter  and I stayed here in ch  Great location  Close to everything and the Corner Bakery across the street is a definite plus Our suite was huge although quite stuffily orated  The bathroom was ble and large  Everything was clean and spotless but all in all nothing rekable  Check in time of pm was not very convenient  The lobby was small and so was the swimming pool and whirlpool  In room dining was awesome especially the Fruit amp Cheese Platter  The concierge did find us some last minute great seats to the Blue Man Group we had a great time thank you 
N => Great Stay I signed up for Wyndham Request and was later informed that because I booked through Hotwire I was ineligible for the great benefits  I was only going to be there for a few days and it was a surprise trip for my boyfriend  However because it was a special occasion the ByRequest lady upgraded us to a ior suite which was really nice  The room was very nice with a larger than usual bathroom  Excellent water pressure and big ol tub to defrost in  The only thing that I didnt think was great was the concierge  Some pretty weak recommendations and some attitude that made me not want to ask any questions at all  Good workout facilities cute heat pool steam room and sauna  I would stay here again but this time in the spring 
N => Great Hotel Got a fantastic deal stay  nights for  and rd night is free  A while after making reservations I found out about the Wyndham Request program and was able to tie it to my reservation  So I had wine crackers cheese bottled water waiting for me when I arrived  The room was huge I couldnt believe I got this room for the price I did  Though I did get it a few months in advance and prepaid  I didnt get the free internet though because they didnt honor the company I went through to make my reservations anymore  There was one day that they didnt finish making our beds they had no sheets on them and no clean towels  Had to call room service to have them finish making the beds  They came promptly and finished making the bed  Everyone was friendly and helpful  
N => Wonderful Wyndham Better than I expected  The Wyndham was wonderful  Spouse and I went over a weekend and were treated very well even though there was a huge conference going on in the hotel  Our room was spacious very clean and far away from the elevator like I requested  When we checked in we were early so the desk held our bags while we went sightseeing this was at  am   check in is not until   On return to the hotel early afternoon the room was ready and just like I requested  We ate at Cala Terra the restuarant at the hotel and it was by far one of the best meals ever  Our waiter was great and was so personable   he helped make the evening special and even went out of his way to obtain some complimentary tickets for us to a jazz bar  Great service and atmosphere  We will definitely stay at the Wyndham again  
N => Chic sexy oasis I loved this hotel    it really was much nicer than your typical business class hotel    had a lot more pizzazz and chic to it  Very comfortable room and spacious bathroom  The concierge was incredibly helpful in getting us a reservation at a terrific restaurant on short notice    he mustve made half a dozen calls  
N => Gorgeous Room   Next to the Tracks This is a lovely hotel that is the embodiment of the W brand   chic hip trendy but yet corporate  I am not chic hip or trendy but I generally try to stay at Starwood hotels and this one was just  blocks from the office I was visiting  My room was huge and well appointed  Unlike other reviewers experience my bathroom was very large and I had plenty of space However the entire experience was red by the fact that my room th floor must have literally been adjacent to the railroad tracks because every   minutes a train rolled by making a noise that was indescribably painful  I did not sleep  winks  In the morning I called the hotel and they moved me  Moral of the story If you stay there be sure to tell them you want a room away from the tracks  
N => Chick Hotel in the Heart of Chicago We had an amazing time at this hotel  When you first walk in youre blown away by the trendy and sleek or its kind of like walking into an upscale lounge  You can tell that s of the people in the lobbylounge are not staying at the hotel but just having some drinks and enjoying the atmosphere  We were immediately asked if we would like to be upgraded to a larger room which of course we obliged to  The room was nice and very crisp feeling  I took advantage of the fitness center every morning which was clean and equipped with personal tvs head phone ipod docks and fruit  We also took advantage of the hotels free Acura experience which saved us a few taxi fares  Overall this was a great experience and we would love to visit again  
N => Nothing great   Rooms are small  Bedding not very clean lots of hair and stains  Location is horrible if you like to explore the area is dead at nightThe topper was that the hotel had no water at am on a Monday morning  The front desk said that a pipe burst and water was cut off to all rooms  Stuff happens but I would have expected the hotel to care more  
N => No running water no apologies The good location for my meetingThe bad tiny room no coffee maker expect one in a  room had to travel  floors to find a working icemaker took  minutes to check in room offered a bottle of water for the low low price of  COME on  They also offered an  bottle of wine for  The truly lousy I awoke to no running water in the room I called to the front desk and got only a quotYeah theyre working on it quot No prognosis or ETA for repairs seemed kind of surprised that I wasnt just accepting quottheyre working on itquot as an answer  Kept pressing and finally got a quotwe can give you a pass for the fitness center a block away quot KEPT pressing and finally got a quotBE we can give you a key to a vacant room that has water quot You mean the hotel has water Then why on earth didnt you offer this to start withEventually I got a shower though had to go to another floor to do so  Was late to my meeting  And grumpy  And no one ever did say quotsorry for the inconvenience quotDo yourself a favor and skip this hotel  
N => Nothing to write home about This was our first stay at a W hotel and we chose it priily because we got a great deal on the room for our quick weekend visit to Chicago  The L is right around the corner making the trip from Midway airport directly to the hotel very easy and also makes getting around Chicago pretty convenient  Our room was newly reated trendy but small and resembled a quotwhat to do with a sqft apartmentquot display at Ikea  The bathroom and majority of the room were very clean but there was a really dirty ottoman which was off putting  We were happy to find that you can check in for your flight and print your boarding passes in the lobby for free but unfortunately we couldnt remember our confirmation number to do that and getting on the internet so that we could find it costs   for  minutes in the business lounge  I dont think its somewhere Id want to be if I were staying longer than a night or  but it worked for what we needed  
N => Disappointing My husband took me to Chicago for our  year Wedding Anniversary and we stayed at the W  First impressions upon check in were UNimpressive  The lobby is quite large but the actual check in area is small dark and cramped and there are individuals who clearly speak english as a second language standing behind kiosks to greet you  Our room was small and so modern it was cold and uninviting  Their choices for or after the remodel look cheap  We were so tired from walking around Chicago one night we ided to try out the restaurant downstairs quotwequot and were even more unimpressed  There were only  other couples in the restaurant which should have been a huge sign to us but we ided to sit down anyway  The waiter was unattentive and kept forgetting things including on  arate occasions a drink order and the side we ordered with our meal  When the side was finally delivered  minutes later it was cold and in a tiny dish and they wanted  for it  Then he charged our credit card the wrong amount   twice  Overall a very disappointing dinner  We asked for late check out the day we were leaving   a Monday when the hotel was a ghost town   and were told the W only offers that services for Platinum members and we would need to pay another  additional to have late check out  We were glad to get back home after a very stressful trip and noticed we were charged a full   TWICE and it had already posted to our account  When I called to speak to the Accounting Department at am they told me to call back at  to give them time to get settled in since they just opened and then they could handle my issue  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I will never stay another W Hotel  They are WAY overrated and under deliver in all areas  On another note   Chicago was a wonderful city and we had some delicious dinners David Burke Steakhouse the Italian Village Ginos East deep dish pizza and Portillos but we will never stay at this hotel again  
N => Disappointing First Time Stay at W Hotel My wife and I had looked forward to our stay at the W Hotel on Adams Avenue in Chicago  Although the hotels location was hard to beat the hotel itself seemed dull and drab  It was more like an industrial building that had quickly and cheaply been converted to hotel quarters  The lobby was very hard to navigate to get to the elevators  The wallpaper in the elevators was a psychedelic style that left us dazed and confused  The room itself was orated in a quotpost industrial style quot Room windows looked into an office building with office workers looking back at us  Employees were friendly and helpful   no complaints there  The lobby and lounge areas seemed to cater more to a swingers crowd  This hotel did not suit our tastes in any manner  In conclusion well not stay at another W Hotel  
N => Clean Chic but something missing stayed here one night in e  usually stay at w lakeshore  prefer lakeshore as there just seems to be more going on there  this place was nice but something just seemed to be missing  perhaps it was lack of a nightclubbar   not sure  vibe was quiet not happening  the space is cool but overall i think theres better  
N => When a hotel wants to be a nightclub    Overall I would say this hotel is unlike any other I have stayed at   they are clearly trying to achieve a vibe of cool hip sexy nightclub as evidenced by the waitresses in the lobby My room though small was far enough from the elevator that it was quiet and met my needs  My major issue with the room was I always had a bit of trouble turning off the many many lights in the room   above the bed the nightstand across othe rparts of a tiny room and BELOW the bed  The bathroom was also tiny but very well cleaned amp kept and stocked with Bliss products which I loved Overall it was fine for my purposes which was just to sleep late and wake up early but the ambience was definitely worth noting  
N => Front desk staff need more training Traveling with my husband and granddhter  The valets at the door were awesome especially Pria Paul he actually made our stay there a little bit more enjoyable  As we entered the hotel I felt it was a little dark  My only problem with my stay was the front desk person on duty that night  and concierge they were not customer friendly at all  I booked my reservation on priceline and when we checked in we were given a queen book when I went to the front desk to request two double beds the gentleman at the front desk advised me the hotel was full and explained I had a child with me he was not very sympathic reminding me that I did book my reservations on priceline I had to walk away at that point  In my mind it shouldnt matter if I did booked at discount site  Later I spoke with the manager Mr  Jones and he was very helpful but the damage had been done  I would not recommend this hotel for travelers with small children you have to go practically through the lounge or bar to get to the elevators and they did not have a swimming pool not kid friendly  
N => I will never stay here again I stayed here as I got a great prepaid rate of  for a Friday and Saturday night unsure of why this hotel was so cheap until I got there  I was also celebrating my birthday  We checked in around pm and first noticed that the lobby was great looking however we had the smallest room I have ever been in We fell asleep and in the middle of the night the airconditioner stopped working we called the front desk and they said they would send someone to fix it  We waited and no one came up  We called again and finally the engineer came up  Then the remote control for the TV didnt work we had to wait again to have someone fix this  After the AC and tv remote was sorted out the bathroom sink broke   one more thing that was adding to our horrible stay  We talked to the front desk and they moved up to another room   the service never changed   we ordered tea the next morning and it took about  minutes to get to our room  We requested a late check out as our flight out wasnt until  and this took a solid  minutes to sort out The location is probably good during weekdays but on weekends NOTHING in the area is open We were not able to find anywhere to have breakfast in the morning dunkin donuts was closed   everything was closed which explains why we got such a great rate at the hotel I expected more from this hotel holding the W name and was seriously let down  
N => Stay at W Lakeshore  Its worth the extra money  I stayed on NYE   Management was rude  As a gold card SPG I was not upgraded only given late check out  The rooms need massive updates  Also the former hotel I forgot the name was raped with cheap comforters and ugly furniture  Had no view  Got mooned  
N => Typical W but seemed more comfortable Stayed here on election night in order to get to Grant Park easily and not have to fight the crowds going home  Ws can be interesting and sometimes feel uncomfortable because they are so trendy  That was not the case here  The rooms were quite large and the bathrooms were top notch  Slate walls great Bliss amenities as usual  Great location in central loop near all modes of public transit  Much better than the W Lakeshore a few blocks away  
N => Appropriate if you enjoy The Girls Next Door  To start off the hotel doesnt appear to view natural light as an amenity  Upon entering the lobby youre deposited in quotThe Living Roomquot a barloungedinner area where people mingle and check in  The furniture was in ent condition but the lighting was so dim it would be easy to miss the details  Later in the week the lounge filled up with patrons making it difficult to pass through the front doors We stayed in a double room on the th floor with a bathroom  half bath  The room itself was spacious but worn out  The carpet had stains and bathroom counters were minute  There was a complete absence of towel racks forcing you to discard towels on the ground Room service was polite and timely but expensive and bland  Supposedly the hotel is undergoing reations colleagues attending the same conference reported being woken up at  by workers and water dripping in their room from above Careful if you book this hotel anytime soon  The location is mediocre in the heart of the financial district for exploring Chicago expect to roll a cab to get to the Magnificent Mile Sears Tower or other attractions  As a side note most of the surrounding Starbucks were closed over the weekend  
N => Let us sleep We just needed a place to stay for the night after an event we attended     Well I can not remember what floor we stayed in the room was very nice    everything in the place was magnificent except for the service    the people from there kept on barging in since we got there    they told us they had a water problem with the room above us    we did not see any water come into our room    we asked then if we could be moved    we were told the hotel was booked solid    no other rooms available    well just great we had workers trying to come into our room at all hours as if they had moved us out   hate the place just for that experience gt 
N => Lipstick on a pig The room was so small that we were tripping over everything fortunately there wasnt enough room to fall down  It took me a while just to find a place to drop my bags  The bathroom was so small that I had to sit sideways with the sink poking into my shoulder  Room  is directly in front of the elevators and you get a lovely quotding ding dingquot every  to  minutes  The plumbing bumps and shreeks like a monster from a Godzilla film every time someone in the building uses any water  You can get free WI FI on a bus or a train but the W charges you  per dayProbably standard but insulting while paying top dollar to stay on a broom closet   The view from our room was non existent  The food was good and the beds were great but this building was simply not designed to be a luxury hotel  In conclusion the rooms are small and I like to complain  
N => A W Ill Actually Vote For Honestly couldnt have been better  We flew in on a red eye and were just looking to drop off our bags until check in  The saintly receptionist advised us they had a room ready almost  hours before check in  On top of this they gave us a free upgrade to a much larger room away from the EL Train and threw in a certificate for  free drinks at the bar for each night we stayed    After checking to see if I was holding a gun in my hand we headed up to our th floor room for a much needed rest Although the hotel isnt perfectly located about   blocks away from shopping theatres museums etc  they offered complementary rides in Acura MDXs one way  from the hotel to anywhere in the city  Not bad for   a night on Hotwire com eh    The hotel can seem a little pretentious but everyone from the staff was exceptionally nice and courteous  Big thumbs up 
N => W  Chicago City Center Our stay was excellent the staff was superior  The hotel itself was wonderful  The room service was great  
N => Fabulous Fabulous property     stayed  nights and loved this hotel  I was alittle concerned after the reveiws and thought about staying at the Lakeshore W instead  SO GLAD I didnt We went to the Lakeshore upon arrival to see what it was like and it was full of early  somethings and the lobby was going off like a frat house Not a very nice property either cheap lobby or We had no noise problem at the W  We had a beautiful room on a higher floor in the inner courtyard   room   The room was massive  with a bathroom thes size of our condo here in Vancouver Room was spotless cool dark and the bed heavenly was hard to get out of each morning to go sightseeing The City Centre W also had a free Acura car service that will take you anywhere in the city great for going out to dinnerWill definatly stay here again without hesitation  will request the same room and location was perfect to everything 
N => A great stay Thought the hotel was great  Seemed a bit more individualistic than the W in San Fran which I felt was a bit quotcookie cutterquot trendy The rooms are small but then so are the rooms in most boutique hotels  But they contain everything you can need and are very well appointed The complimentary Acura car service was a great idea and used it a couple of times Staff were friendly is a little abrupt I was disappointed about the location as I wanted shops not offices but this was my fault I should have looked at the location closer and it wasnt too bad getting to Michigan Ave  
N => Loud rooms Very dissapointed   my first room was the loudest I have ever stayed at   the railroad kept me up all night even though I was on the th floorMoved to a very slightly quieter room there do not appear to be any rooms where the railroad isnt very loud but had to sacrifice a lot of space and the comfortable chair that was in the first room and was told that if I wanted a bigger more comfortable room would have to be on the street side that would prevent a good nights sleepGlass pained door into my rainforest shower was actually a plastic shower curtain with cheap shower headThey also tried to charge me   night when I had a guaranteed group rate of Wanted to leave but city booked for conventionMy advice   stay away 
N => Very Good Experience As a business traveler my criteria for selecting a hotel is location to my meeting proximity to interesting local sites and a Starwood property  I was happy that the W met these objectives  Its close to the Chicago office a short walk to parks museums the lake and shopping  Its not central to the Miracle Mile but only about a  minute walk or a  cab ride  The hotel was funky  The lobby is candle lit  I walked past the reception desk when I was trying to check in because my eyes hadnt acclimated yet  I think that happens to guests a lot because there was a hotel employee stationed to steer me back when I missed the k  Youve got to expect that type of quirkiness at a W  I found the staff friendlier here than at other Ws  The room was very good  I had a large corner room with a king  It was newly remodeled  I was very happy with it  I paid the regular rate  I think there are other rooms that are tight though  My only nit was that I couldnt fit my laptop in the room safe  I guess I need a new laptop  I highly recommend the W  
N => Not worth the money This hotel is in a great location downtown  We even managed to find free street parking right across from the hotel entrance However the room was nothing to write home about  It was very close to the quotElquot so we could hear that the whole time  We were there on a Saturday night and heard the constant whistle that the staff used to summon cabs  The room needed to be vacuumed and it was a bit dusty  There was no coffee maker and the blow dryer was tiny  We were supposed to have a keyboard for internet access through the TV but that was lacking  The bed was heavenly comfortable  The bathroom was clean and the sheets were clean  The room service was excellent  For paying so much I was expecting a lot more  Probably wouldnt fork out that kind of money to stay there again  Seems they spend all their money on the lobby and the nightclub instead of the rooms  
N => BIG disappointment My wife attended a conference in Chicago and the W Chicago Center was one of the recommended hotels  Because we had stayed at W in San Francisco last year and loved it she was anxious to stay at the W again  A week or so before we went to Chicago we received our credit card bill to find that the W had already charged over  to our credit card  When we arrived at the W my wife pointed out that we had already been charged for  for our room  The desk clerk argued that we had not been charged but be only had quota hold placedquot  It was only after we presented a copy of the credit card statement and she disappeared into a back room did she agree that we had already paid   One of the first things the desk clerk said to us was to ask if we wanted to upgrade to a larger room  We lined thinking that a  a night room should be adequate  This turned out to be the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in  Everyone knows how small the bathrooms are on cruise ships  The bathroom we had on our last cruise which happened to be an interior room not one of the top of the ship rooms was bigger than the W s bathroom  I counted the floor tiles  The sink was smaller than my bar sink at home  There was about an inch or two on each side of the sink to try to balance anything you tried to put down  You had to close the lid of the toilet to reach the flush lever  The only drawer space in the room were three small drawers in the night stand  The carpet was dirty  Of course it is very hard to see anything because it was so dark in the room  One lamp had a fairly ent light but the other lamp  the one on the desk  if it was a  watt bulb I would be surprised  I tried to use the DVD player provided in the room but it was so dark in that corner that I could not see the controls  On Sunday I asked the concierge for recommendations for dinner  He suggested we eat at the restaurant in the hotel  Later when we were ready for dinner we found that the restaurant is not open on Sundays  On the positive the lobby area is very nice very hip with projections on the walls above the two giant archways  W always has a nice smell  The concierge desk was very helpful in printing out our boarding passes for our trip home  
N => Tiny rooms good service I chose the W because some other folks I was traveling with were staying there  I travel a lot and generally look forward to staying at a W  I would have to say that the W City Center was really a disappointment  The room was tiny about  sq  ft and the price was in line with some really nice properties in the area about nt  The hotel and the rooms were very stylish but not enough to overcome the small dank rooms  Service was generally very good as expected with a W  
N => would not be my choice to stay here     I had to travel to Chicago for business    for two nights  The other people in my group were staying here so this is where my company booked my room as well  I arrived around pm Chicago time  Naturally all of the rooms with king beds were not available and it was my own fault for asking for a lower floor room since Im not a fan of hotel elevators so I guess I got what I deserved but not really for   per nightI think Ive only stayed in one other hotel room that might have been smaller but not by much  The room had a queen sized bed and was just barely big enough to hold it  The window was so old it wouldnt close all of the way so the wind was whistling in and naturally the El was extremely loud  Apparently theyve ided to go the opposite way with the heat as compared to one of the prior reviewers experience  I turned my heat completely off even with the non closing window with it being   degrees outside and it still felt like a sauna  The bathroom was so tiny and the shower was like a phone booth  I hit my elbow so very hard on the little shelf in the shower just trying to move my arm When I mentioned my room issues to the other people in my group they were not experiencing the same thing so I guess I was just the lucky one to receive this horrible room  Im glad it was only for  nights and that I wasnt there to enjoy the hotel  It would not be a place I would want to stay by choice  
N => Whatever whenever HORRIBLE experience Attached is the letter that I sent to hotel management that came back to me with quotsorry your experience fell short of your expectations and the hotel restaurant has taken steps to correct quot No free night stay no restaurant vouchers no credits to our credit card no real attempt at keeping customers  Quite honestly I don t even know where to begin  Every year the second week in ember my husband plans a downtown weekend for my birthday which he has done for several years  This includes a minimum two night stay dinner and the theater  We live in the suburbs and love spending the weekend in the city  We enjoy shopping holiday orations and because of my birthday so close to the holiday my husband takes special care to make it memorable  To date we both immensely enjoy the weekend All except this last birthday at the W Hotel City Center  I will highlight the less desirable incidents as I feel awful that my birthday celebration was such a disappointment ember   Upon arrival in the room we had to turn the thermostat up because the room was freezing I don t mean cold and uncomfortable but  see your breath  freezing  The bed was not a standard king which was stated and the room extremely small  The sheet had a large stain which I am going to say was blood at the head of the bed between the pillows  I called the front desk immediately and let them know that we had reservations downstairs at the hotel restaurant at  p m  and they could change the sheets while we were at dinner  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant Ristorante We  Absolutely the worst service of any restaurant that we have been to and the food was mediocre at best  From the time we were seated it took  minutes to get a glass of water and my husband had to wave someone down to ask for bread  It took another  minutes for the waiter to take our order  As we had plenty of time to look at the menu we ordered the appetizer and entr e initially  It took  minutes to receive our appetizer  At that point we were in the restaurant  minutes before receiving an appetizer The entr e arrived in another  minutes  My husband insisted we order a dessert I told him that I was unwilling to wait  minutes for dessert but he insisted that it was my  birthday weekend  and he was equally upset with everything but remained optimistic determined to have a good time  We ordered dessert  Not only did it  minutes to get to us the order was wrong  My cr me brulee was chocolate cake and then the waiter was indignant when I said  I didn t order this   He said that he would put in the order for cr me brulee  At that point the tears started and I asked my husband for the key to our room and waiting another  minutes for my dessert was simply absurd  I left the restaurant and waited in the lobby until he was finished with the bill  We he left the restaurant he then said  you will NEVER believe this  not only did he not remove the incorrect dessert from the bill he haggled me when I told him that it needed removed from the bill and I didn t even ask him to remove the dessert that I didn t eat  My husband said which even surprised me  today is the first day in my entire life that I left NO tip though the service was lousy until he hassled me about the dessert I had every intention of leaving a tip  After that horrible experience we return to the room only to find the sheets had not been changed  I told my husband that I have had enough of the W hotel and I was going to take a long shower while he took a shot at getting some clean sheets  Sometime after  p m  the sheets where finally changed ember     a m  We left the hotel to go downtown to shop bought new fleece pajama s because the room was so cold and returned to our hotel at  p m  to get ready for our  p m  reservations at Everest then to the theater for Jersey Boys   Time was of the essence  It had begun to snow so we needed to leave by  p m  Upon returning our room had not been touched we where gone all day and no one had cleaned the room  The cleaning lady showed up a  p m  to clean our room so we went downstairs to have a drink while our room was cleaned  At that point my husband apologized for picking such a horrible hotel for my birthday  He said he was ashamed of himself for not doing more research and picked the room from a website because it had a contemporary eclectic style  He felt awful and I felt bad for him and bad that we were stuck there for another night  With  inches of snow that we had overnight the room was freezing when we returned  We thought the cleaning lady had set the thermostat back down but we discovered she had not  We turned the heat up for the second night in a row ember  Packing up to leave the room in adjusting the blinds and drapes realize the window was OPEN  The window was open about an inch and would not close no matter how hard we tried it was broken open  Which explained why the sounds of the city kept us up every night  My husband has apologized with shame countless times and ends with  I just wanted you to have a great birthday   Isn t your motto   Whatever whenever Based on the service we received it sure didn t feel like it to us  The next time we will spend time doing extensive research to include on line reviews before choosing a hotel or simply stay home and drive to the city for dinner and the theater  We will certainly not recommend the W Hotel or the Ristorante We in the future  
N => Disappointed We should have done more research  We went to Chicago for a fun weekend and an Astros   Cubs game and I booked us the W because I thought that the W hotels I had seen always looked quite cool  This one is in the business district and not a great weekend hotel  I changed the room because our first one was tiny  The room they moved us to was better but still no quotwowquot factor  
N => mixed review We used our American Express reward points to stay here and I have to say that we were disappointed  Our room was small and dark  I went to the front desk and spoke with Michael and he moved us to a nicer room  The location was ok within walking distance to the Sears Tower and the theatre where we saw Wicked  But I just felt pent up  We had a choice between here and the Westin on Michigan Ave and I picked this since I had stayed at the Westin and LOVED it so I wanted something different  All in all I wish I picked the Westin or didnt waste the points  Oh well     
N => Priceline RIPOFF I used Priceline as I always do when booking a leisure stay or weekend getaway  ember    I received the quotW quot Hotel thru name your own price and was pleased with the price named and paid as always  After receiving this hotel I called to request a king size bed or a two double bed room  I always have been able to receive this request with every other hotel booked this way  When calling the quotWquot I was told that all I would be receiving would be a room with one full size bed and any other accommodations would be an upgrade  Not happy at this point  Priceline states that a room would be available to accommodate two full size adults  My experience with a full size bed does not accommodate two full size adults  When I arrived to check in I was charged an upgrade of  a night for a room with two full size beds  In all the times using Priceline this has never happened before  Stay clear of the quotWquot and do not use Priceline that has the quotWquot in its buying area  This hotel is a big mistake by Priceline and a RIPOFF  I contacted Priceline but had no satisfaction from customer service  
N => Do not waste your money I stayed at the W City Center Chicago for a business trip  The only good thing was the location of the hotel to my office  The hotel was dark loud and unorganized  When I checked into the hotel I had to jump from one check in person to the next  They put me in a room right outside from the elevator even though I asked to be moved  After I got to my room the room I called to see if I could be moved and was told that someone would be up to move me  After  minutes I phoned to ask them to cancel because I couldnt sit there and wait unpacked much longer  On the way back to the office the elevators were out which meant taking a freight elevator back and forth  Its not their fault but it was just very annoying  The room was dark bad lighting and not very clean  The sink had ks in it and the bathroom seemed dirty  I was not all impressed with this hotel  The rates I was given a corporate rate are very high for what you receive  I could have stayed in a less expensive hotel and had better accomodations  I will not be staying at the W again  
N => Pricelines BIG MISTAKE I got a very cheap rate off priceline com for this place  From reading prior reviews it seems this is a big priceline com place Well let me tell you until I got a room here off priceline I WAS a big fan of pricelineThe cost of this hotel was great but clearly EVERYTHING ELSE was not within our budget  And Im NOT a cheapskate but the mini bar prices have to be the highest Ive ever encountered and the room service menu was extremely bizarre  My partner and myself were very disappointed with almost all aspects of this hotel  We were looking for a quiet place which was quickly dispelled upon entering the hotel the lobby was blaring music and had a nightclub atmosphere  OK this is fine if you know first hand you have this to deal with but we wanted a peaceful quiet place  So we were stuck with staying in our room The room was extremely dimly lit and very small and cramped  We had to basically crawl over each other to get to the rest room  The bed was the best part of the entire ordeal  Everything else was a big disappointment  We didnt like anything on the room service menu and felt it was overpriced  We didnt want to go back to the loud nightclub lobby so we went to bed I would go into a total rage if I ever got this room off of priceline again  
N => Good location Small room The good The W Chicago City Center is in a great location across the street from Sears Tower and a very short walk to the trains  We redeemed Starwood points for a room for one night other nights in Chicago were at Sofitel Rosemont due to a business trip  The or is modern and stylish The not so good We got a quotWonderful Roomquot which I knew was going to be small but I didnt expect it feel as cramped as it did  If we had to stay here more than one night or if we were going to spend more time relaxing in the room I would have probably paid extra for an upgrade to a bigger room The bad The shower was tiny and the drain did not work well so when we took a shower there was water to our ankles  Overall if you stay at this hotel I would book a larger room unless you dont mind tight space  
N => Very stylish hotel I stayed at the W City Centre with my two teenage girls this past weekend  I got the room through priceline and had to go to  I think bc it was the weekend of Lollopalloza sp and the city was very busy  I was a little concerned on a few fronts would the room be large enough Would we feel hopelessly uncool and would the staff be nice or would they be condescendingI have to say that things worked out very well  Yes I am not cool enough for this hotel but it didnt seem to matter  My girls thought it was amazing  They loved the neat little touches like the purple pumpkin or whatever that was on the bed the stylish accoutrements the Bliss body products  The room was small  I requested a rollaway ahead of time and also upon check in  It was not there  We went out for a few hours and it was not there when we returned  However we called the quotWhateverwheneverquot number a rather precious touch imo but my girls though it was cute and one was sent up right away  Funny enough the lovely gentleman who delivered it did not seem to know where to put it in our small room We kind of pushed furniture around and I hoped I would not hit my head on the desk during the night  That being said it that rollaway was more comfortable than many beds Ive slept on and the bed for the girls was sublime Everyone was friendly the location was pretty good although a few nights later we were at the InterContinental and that location was for us better  The movie quotBatmanquot was being filmed outside the hotel so that was neat to watch  Id stay there again but I might be more tempted to do the W Lakeshore next time  
N => Very modern and trendy hotel I enjoyed my stay at this hotel  The room was just the right size and bathroom was very spacious  The minibarfridge was a little on the pricey side but to be expected  The LCD tv in the room was nice feature  The gym in the hotel was set up with very modern equipment that includes tvs attached to each of the elipticaltreadmill machines  For a hotel gym it was a good size and had the right equipment to get in a good workout  The front desk said the hotel had air tight rooms that kept the noise out but I heard garbage trucks picking up trash around pm  Luckily the trucks didnt stay around too long and the rest of the night was relatively quiet  The close proximity to a few tourist attractionsSears Tower Museum of Modern Art that we had planned to visit was nice  The lobby was definitely more lounge spot than a true hotel lobby  With my gf and I in our late s it was definitely something we didnt expect but really enjoyed  I really like the modern feel of the hotel even thought it was a little on the pricey side  I would definitely recommend this hotel  
N => Small rooms but loved it anyway Loved my stay here with my girlfriend  Yes the rooms are small but theyre very nice  The beds are amazingly comfortable  I wouldnt call it centrally located but it is fairly close to many things we walked everywhere just to absorb the city  Train stations are nearby and will take you anywhere  Do not take a cab to or from the air port it only cost  bucks to take the train versus a  cab ride  The downstairs bar is very trendy and the crowd spills over into the lobby  It is very swanky and trendy filled with young professionals out to have a couple happy hour drinks we loved that our hotel was the place to be seen  Room service brought us the most delicious burger Ive ever had but it was exspensive  
N => AWESOME Surely one of my favorites We were a little concerned after booking on Hotwire  I had looked here to see what people were getting for Hotwire deals in the  range    but we were so happy We were travelling with a baby and I had read the rooms were small  We understood the hotel would be HIp and Trendy so I was ready for all of that  I called ahead to make sure they had a crib   they did and I asked about the size of bed   she says happily quotyou have a wonderful room  quot meaning a full sized bed  When we arrived am to check our bag she said our room the quotspectacular Kingquot was not ready but we could stay in another however it was near the El  We chose to pass    came back later as planned and found the room to be EXCELLENT Very nice in design and I loved the mood lighting roomy bathroom    all excellent  After we were in the room for  minutes or so a room service person came to make sure we were happy and didnt need anything We also loved the strawberry water at the end of a hot day    Starbucks coffee in the morning could have made more though 
N => Stay eleswhere My stay was ked by a extremely small and cramped room with a extremely high price  A half eaten cashews left in room that was replaced by staff and then charged  Five days and additional charges appeared even after I left for the earlier days Never credited my account for deposits made to the hotel Starwood corporate management can not seem to resolve this with this hotel  The room was the smallest room I have ever stayed in the controls for the heat and cooling were hidden behind the TV cabinet I was not even able to see the temperature on the digital display because the cabinet was less then twelve inches away and unable to use the temperature controls The bathroom was another issue throughout my stay first the tub backed up and when taking a shower you would have about of foot of water in the tub  I called to report and start to tell the person and they already apparently knew of the issue for when I said I had a problem with the shower they saidquot is the water slow going downquot  I said well it is not really going down at all  She said she would have someone take a look at it  Nothing was corrected as each time I took a shower the same results of having to stand in dirty shower water rising up my feet shins and legs To make matters anymore frustrating the one morning I could sleep in I was awakened at  by someone from your staff pounding on the doors on the floor for housekeeping I have already sent several emails to the Director of Operations Tomas Caramucci to say the least unresponsive Corporate still a month later can not get this property to clear up the improper billing and proper credits for   deposit that was never credited Stay at this hotel at your own risk MY suggestion stay elsewhere you will make your stay without this poorly managed and operated Hotel 
N => Convenient but not where Id choose to stay again We stayed at the W while we were in town for a wedding this past weekend  It was not my first choice but we found it hard to find a hotel in downtown Chicago by the time we were booking  The hotel itself tries to be very trendy   not my scene but it  be okay for some  The location is great   half a block from the Quincy station on the orange line straight to Midway and a few blocks from the Art Institute  I wouldnt go out of my way to stay at this hotel but the service was good and it was in a convenient location  Some reviewers were critical of the service they received   I found everyone to be very helpful particularly upon check in  We got upgraded to a room with a bigger bed  The rooms are very small   I would be hesitant to stay here if I was planning to spend any amount of time in my room e g  working  It would be very claustrophobic  Internet access cost    day highway robbery but there are computers available by the lobby Macs only  The hotel is definitely showing some signs of wear hard to see though because it is so dimly lit  All in all   not the worst hotel in the world but definitely an exercise in form over substance  Not a destination hotel but nice enough  
N => Good Location   and thats all Stayed at the W as a meeting site got an inexpensive room rate and an experience that matched  Would never want to stay again if could avoid at any price  W City Center was a poor venue for a meeting site  Staff was courteous but seeing staff trying so hard to make everything look so cool was painfully adolescent  Lobby halls room all dark and noisy  Room was as small as a good sized master bath  Food service was terrible   looked flashy but cold and tasted plastic  I would not again choose to attend any meeting or seminar held at this hotel as was too unpleasent of an quotexperiencequot  
N => Very Impressed I recently stayed here on a business trip to an office in the ATampT Corporate center around the corner  The W City Center is one of my companys corporate preferred hotels but the rate was about  more expensive than our corporate rate at the Peninsula and about  more than what the Four Seasons wanted that night  To be fair the W had been sold out and some rooms seemed to have become available a few days in advance but at abnormally high rates over  Still I chose to stay at the W for convenience purposes so as to not have to take a taxi to the office in the morning  The ability to earn Starpoints also factored into this ision Anyway I arrived around pm and check in was very very efficient  My reservation was for a Wonderful room the lowest category but because of my SPG Gold status andor the high rate I was paying I was given a Spectacular room I thought the room was great overall  Very spacious and comfortable  My only two complaints were that the toilet was in a tiny tiny room off the bathroom and the desk chair was a little worn and uncomfortable I was doing some late night work on my computer I stopped by reception on the way out to get a new printout of my statement reflecting my minibar purchase and that was handled very efficiently too Bottom line    the Spectacular room was great  Judging from the other reviews here I would stay away from the Wonderful rooms  This was also a low maintenance stay for me check in work on the internet sleep check out so I had no service issues I would stay here again if in the Loop on business  
N => Avoid this place Afraid I have to agree with many of the other reviews on here  I would not stay here again  Im a Starwood fanatic Platinum status and despite that its not worth the points  Tiny rooms horrible old bathrooms views into an interior shaftway yet still somehow noisy  At check in  at night flight delayed starving    the assistant kept saying quothold on a momentquot and would disappear   different times  and after half an hour handed me a room key  I was excited that she had managed to arrange some kind of amazing upgrade but NO she just took  minutes to check me in The lobby scene is disappointing  My advice to anyone thinking of this hotel is either stay at the W Lakeshore or my new favorite the Hard Rock Hotel much nicer than you would think  how Ws should be  
N => Tiny room overpriced noisy lobby I have a client in the Loop who recommended W as a convenient hotel within walking distance of the office  That is was but there was nothing else to recommend it  My room was clean at least but tiny  I had to throw the rug out of the bathroom to get the door to close and I had to close the door to use the sink because there was no place else to stand  I could only get the shower diverter valve to work by wedging a bar of soap under it the only bar of soap provided btw  The lighting in the room was barely adequate the halls amp lobby are intentionally I guess dim  Loud music pervaded the public spaces so much so that I was not tempted to visit the restaurant  The staff was unhelpful  And they charge for internet access  
N => Not coming back I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past  years with average to above average experiences  This past stay was the last  My husband and I checked in only to find that they did not have the non smoking room we reserved  Much to my disliking we went ahead and agreed to take the smoking room  Management said they would quottake care of usquot  Ha They gave us a card for  drinks in their lounge  Normally I would have just let this go   but then I woke up with red bumps all over my legs arms and neck  Went home and to the dor yep  BED BUGS GROSS and totally unacceptable for a hotel that bears the starwood name  I paid night for bed bugs and smoky pillows  
N => Not so bad I wasnt expecting very much from this hotel both from the reviews and because Im not a fan of the generally dimloud W ambiance but had a ent experience here First impressions were not great   the door staff seems a bit unclear on the concept of what door staff is actually supposed to do  The cab driver and I had to unload and juggle my luggage in the freezing cold as the first doorman I saw stood inside the all glass outer lobby doors  feet away and watched us  He was nice enough to open the door   staying inside   as I finally approached it  He did not open the second set of doors   two additional door staff just inside those doors smiled nicely but didnt open those doors or offer to take my bags  Perhaps they were all just orative to add to the quotclubquot ambiance Check in was easy and service throughout the rest of the stay was fine   friendly and professional The lobby was dim and loud as I had expected   its not particularly my style but for a business district hotel it had probably the liveliest social scene around  The hallways were ridiculously dim   possibly to hide the horrendously scuffed wallpaperWhere this hotel really redeemed itself was the room  It was a nice medium size not bad for a downtown business hotel at all and was well lit well furnished comfortable and clean  The bathroom was quite large and nicely furnished albeit with a public bathroom style toilet  The linens were extremely nice and the bed was very comfortable if soft  The hotel is on the same block as the El but the El wasnt loud enough to be annoying Best of all I checked in late and the room service menu at pm was still extensive   the not too expensive burger I ordered arrived quickly and was astonishingly tasty especially for hotel food  Cocktails including a very good mojito are also available via room service which was a nice little surprise There arent many hotels directly in the business district where I needed to be   notwithstanding the glitches Ill likely return if I need to be in the same neighborhood  
N => Do Not Stay Here   Thieves are at Work here I was excited to be staying at the W Chicago City Center especially after being upgraded to a suite due to Starwood Platinum status  However within a few short hours I was ready to leave  Within  hours of checking in after coming back from lunch and visiting the Art Institute my partner and I walked in to our th Floor suite only to discover that both of our computer bags and laptop and contents in each were gone  One bag was a Tumi computer briefcase which had been a Christmas gift and this was the first time it was being used  There was no signs of forced entry so obviously it was an inside job  I have stayed at lots of upper tier hotels but never have I had a theft from my locked hotel room  Many times I have gone out and left my laptop opened up on the desk and housekeepers have cleaned around it  I was completely shocked as you would not expect this from a  night hotel  This theft of two laptops and computer bags and other miscellaneous content topped   The first Security representative from the hotel that took our report was courteous apologetic and helpful  However the Director of Security for the hotel didnt improve our perceptions of the hotel as he explained in great detail that he was new to this hotel and he was having issues with his ID accessing the room key audit  He would then have to wait another day till management could get his ID reset etc etc  We certainly didnt feel safe and secure in a hotel where its Director of Security was having issues with his own ID  Salawi the Night Mgr was very accomodating even lending us a laptop to use during our stay  Mr  Caramucci the Operations Manager did file a claim with their insurance and later we did get partial compensation for our loss  To begin with even the representative for their insurance was very cold and unapologetic after taking  days for her to call me back  She even tried to infer that it was our fault since we had not locked our laptops in the hotels safe  In this hotel our laptops would not fit into the safe much less an entire computer bag  When you are staying in a hotel especially one of this stature you should have enough trust in their security that you can leave a bag while you are out of the room  Needless to say I did not feel that my Starwood Platinum status was redeeming itself now My comments about the hotel are rather consistent with the other reviews here  It is a nice lobby in terms of or but that is about it You walk in and instantly you feel like youre in a nightclubeven at  AM with techno music playing at all hours a strobe light projecting images along the walls  To me it is not a soothing and comfortable environment  Give me the Ritz Carlton anyday At nights the lounge crowd consumes the entire lobby and you feel like you are in a reunion of drunk sorority sisters all trying to out talk and out dress the other making it impossible to carry on a conversation without having to scream at one another  The hallways are very dark and almost impossible to see in front of you  Even the rooms are dimly lit as well  One of my bathrooms was so dark it was even frustrating to take a shower  Please heed my warnings do not stay here I certainly will never go back to this hotel  
N => Everything was Perfect My boyfriend and I stayed a night at the W and from the moment we got there we had a perfect experience  We arrived a couple of hours before check in but they allowed us to check in anyhow and even upgraded our room  With the exception of our hotel room door we never once opened a door or lifted a finger while we were at the W  The employees were all friendly and helpful  Every time we used valet the service was prompt and courteous  I would definitely stay again at this hotel  
N => Party at the W Hotel in Chicago   Lakeshore My wife and I are no strangers to the W Hotels and are accustomed to the or people and club like atmosphere a stay at a W Hotel offers  We were booked at the City Center but immediately knew upon arrival that this was not the W we are so used to  We immediately requested to transfer to the W Lakeshore and we were well taken care of  The W staff was very accommodating and to that I give them kudos While we were only in the Spectacular room for only minutes the or was very quotWquot esque  Given the location this W caters more to a business clientele I do not suggest this W for weekenders or out of towners  For a party atmosphere and more convenient location to quottouristy thingsquot stay at the W Lakeshore  
N => This place is a dump  This W is a dump  It seems as though they have some severe servicemanagementupkeep issues The rooms are small  not quothotel in the cityquot small but Times Square Hotel in the City Small  The room  wide and was no more than  square feet  The bathroom was extremely tiny as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop  But thats the least of their problems The shower didnt drain and I didnt want to take a bath  So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over quot deep    My SO had to take a shower in my dirty shower water and it never drained so the bathtub was probably over half full by the time all was said and done  I told the maid who came and knocked on our door at  even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out  something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over but by then I had already showered and didnt care and it sounded like it would be more hassle so we told her not to go get someone  Upon checkout they didnt do anything for our troubles The bathroom didnt seem to have a fan just a vent grate in the door    So there was little in the way of privacy there  There was a heater in the bathroom but when turned on it made the place smell like a smokey bar even though it was a non smoking room we were in There was no room service menu in our room just a quotDining Inquot book    But then there was a Room Service button on our phone so Im pretty sure they did have regular room service  We ordered breakfast it took  minutes to get our order then it came and it wasnt correct  They serve potatoes but didnt bring ketchup  They serve toast but didnt bring BUTTER How can room service not bring butter for toast It was  for an omeletpotatoestoast  scrambled eggsbaconpotatoestoast and one orange juice  And it wasnt even good neither of us finished eating even half of it The room wasnt wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed it was off to the side and didnt really pull outrotate so you could watch it head on    BTW someone else on here complained about it but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as Im concerned       If they really were as hip as they think they are they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed   The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia which I like     I really like the design they have going on it is very trendy and works well  They even found a way to make the drop ceiling in the room look really nice The door man didnt bother to open the door for me as I was walking out he just stood there watching    be Im being prissy but he IS a door man and he wasnt doing anything at the time and he was standing right in front of the door We were told wifi Internet was actually day to use which includes free calls too    something I could care less about not     Either way its overpriced The rooms were very loud  Every noise in the hallway upstairs hotel room adjacent room outside cars el etc were heard  Parking is  which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates even though garages in the area arent more than day Im never staying here again and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks  And if you do go avoid room     As cute as it sounds its just bad news I hope not all W Hotels are like this one  Insanity reigns at the W City Center  
N => All glitz little substance Although I found my room to be of adequate size and comfort several strange things that happened during my stay red my visit  I was there  nights in all and on my second night there I woke up to hear a quick knock on my door and then heard the door opening Luckily I had the security latch on but it was the maid quotchecking my roomquot At  p m  Very strange and unnerving for a single woman staying alone in a hotel  The next night although I set the room thermostat at  degrees I woke about  a m  to find the temperature spiking to about  degrees for no apparent reason The last straw was when I checked my credit card online today and found that they had charged me   apparently for the quothonor barquot I had not used anything so called and it was supposedly for a very expensive bottle of water After I told accounting that I would dispute the charge on my credit card they agreed to remove it  I also found the lobby area with the disco ball going at all times to be pretentious and distracting and as others have stated the lighting in the corridors to be very dim especially near the elevator  Would not choose to stay here again  
N => Not worth it If youre going to stay at a W in Chicago head to the Lake Shore  The City Center location has postage stamp sized rooms that are loud and cold  I would not stay at the W in City Center again  
N => Funky Vibe but small noisy room Just came back from a one night stay from W City Center in Chicago  The hotel is in a great spot right across the Sears Tower  Bell hop was not friendly when we ided to take our own bags in definately snubbed us when we wanted him to hail us a cab  Reception were very friendly though and couldnt do enough  Gave us maps and details to get to the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival which was on that evening I have to say that the reception area lobby is absolutely fantastic its just like the set for a music video and as you would expect is propped up with model like characters draping themselves over the furniture The room was small and even though it was away from the El trains was still very noisy  It was nicely refurbished but it was rather a thin veneer  If you take a look at the ceiling you can see that they have just painted the polystyrene tiles to match in  The TV Armoir took up the whole room and the TV reception was very poor  Surely all TVs should be replaced with LCDs by now There was a huge bottle of Voss water next to the bed which wasnt clear it was complimentry so we left it just in case Great tea and coffee making facilities were included which was great and unusual in american hotels Bed was comfortable but was only a queen size would have preferred a king  I think it was called a wonderful room  The hotel did have a rather overstyled feel to it which grated after a feel but it was fine for one night The breakfast was velous in the WE restaurant and I thorougly recommend it however most american breakfast ARE fantastic to us Brits As a whole I would choose W again but it is not my favourite mid luxury chain  That would be Sofitel    
N => A taste of a different life A quick note to say that whilst this hotel isnt within my normal price range travelling through work allowed me to stay there  It was simply superb  Everything from or to the in room amenities is thought about in a different way  Attention to detail was excellent the overall hotel rooms included was very stylish and every member of hotel staff I came into contact with was more than helpful  
N => Loved The W Reading other reviews I was hesitant to stay at this hotel    but due to the Chicago athon going on the same weekend we were there we were lucky to get ANY room in the area  And we really were lucky The hotel is a fine old architecturally interesting place  The lobby welcoming and beautiful  The staff were EXCEPTIONAL attentive to our every need  We really enjoyed the culturally diverse staff  Check in was fast and the clerk Salawi sp from Botswana was just fantastic  The concierge James helped us throughout our stay with our multiple change of plans and excellent advice  Housekeeping room service even the engineering department we needed a screw driver for a kids toy were immediately accessible and helpful  Our room was on the th floor   not much view due to the high buildings all around   but very clean spacious and comfortable  The  double beds were very plush and comfy we had more than enough room for a roll out bed as well  But again I dont think I have ever stayed in a hotel with friendlier or more helpful staff and lots of staff everywhere you want them to be  Easy walking distance to everything we wanted to do  Would stay again in a heartbeat 
N => OKish Well arrived in Chicago          and entered the stunning lobby of the W         it looks fantastic         quickly processed our booking from a very friendly receptionist        up to our room         it was awful        tiny dark little natural light a ghastly small bathroom that felt grubby It was such a depressing small room        and for   We ided we could not quotcopequot with this room so we called down to the main desk       the person we spoke to was not very friendly or sympathetic  We called back to say we stay at W hotels alot so after telling them this and taking a hard line approach that we were leaving if not re assigned a better room      success        the hotel was full that night but they would move us to another better room tomorrow  They did         the new room was much more spacious and really quite pleasant  The staff are in general wonderfully friendly  esp  Amber amp Gus  The bar is very relaxing and breakfast good though expensive  I like W Hotels though this isnt their best example i had an enjoyable stay eventually 
N => Not up to W standards   Needs refreshing Ive always considered W hotels to be hip chic modern and immaculate  And Im sure when the W Chicago City Center first opened it was new and fresh  But now its time for it to be refreshed  The room I was in looked extremely shabby paint chipping from wallsac unit dingy carpet etc   Shabby chic almost works when you have a classically styled hotel but it does not work for modern But I will admit that the service was great and the common areas were festive consistent with most Ws Ive been to  
N => Shabby disguised as chic We stayed at the W City Center for three nights on a very busy weekend in Chicago  two adults and a teen  On arrival we were greeted by a lobby bursting with people  Not an empty seat in the place  Kids were running babies were crying and there was luggage everywhere  The lobby is dark orated like a nightclub with candles burning and loud music playing  Navigating this confusion we went to check in  We were greeted warmly but unfortunately our room wasn t ready  This was five in the afternoon  We were hot and tired from traveling so the desk person offered a room to shower in  Grateful we accepted so we saw our first room  It was gloomy miniscule and dark  After showering there we continued to wait for OUR room  At last we checked in only to be dised by what we found  Another TINY room  We were barely able at walk between the miniature double bed and the desk  When we called downstairs to ask for the two beds we had reserved we were told quotSorry full tonight  be tomorrowquot Misery  The bathroom was literally so small that your knees hit the door when you sat on the toilet However the most unsettling part of our stay was the rowdy behavior of the fellow guests  Is this a nightclub or a hotel We got on the elevator with a group of twenty somethings  They had clearly been drinking  The  ladies  were carrying dark plastic drink glasses shaped like a phallus which they chose to discuss in graphic detail  My husband almost lost his temper with the young  gentlemen  of the group who felt that making jokes about their toy in an elevator filled with adults was appropriate behavior  YuckI don t think a hotel can be all things to all people so the W was not a pleasant experience for us  But if you like your nightlife in the lobby and on the elevator this is the place for you  
N => service is cold We stayed here one Friday night in y The ROOM Yes they are smaller than the rooms in the SheratonChicagowhere I stayed the weekend before  The king size bed we had was good but not great  The bed was not firm enough and the sheets were not as creamy soft   The room overall was fine but I had this sense that it could have been cleaner  The walls were stained with dirt  I felt like washing my hands all the time which I did with the BLISS soap The room we had faced Adams street and we had no noise or light problems  THE SERVICE We asked for two pairs of slippers so that we wouldnt have to walk on the carpet which looked really old  We waited about  minutes and they only brought up one pair THE PRICE We paid  per night not including tax through their website OVERALL My husband liked the dark room and the non corporate feel of the lobby  I felt that the furnishings and or looked shabby  The service is fine if somewhat slow  The only real downer was the guy who checked us in  He acted like he was doing us a favor  I would not make a huge effort to stay here again  be the deluxe rooms are nicer  
N => Upscale but too many downsides at the W I checked out all the hotels listed on Trip Advisor carefully before booking a Saturday night stay at the W  Frankly I was a little worried not all the reviews were glowing and it cost more than we wanted to spend but we liked the location It has some wonderful features but a lot of bad points too Yes the lobby and hallways are dark  Were talking VERY DARK Anyone with vision problems does not want to navigate through this place After the hustle and bustle of the city it does feel restful but having people suddenly appear out of the darkness makes you a bit edgyThe rooms themselves were well lit  I liked the minialistic or    including the pillow shaped like a giant plum on the bed My husband wasnt quite as impressed  But we agreed the mattress was probably the most comfortable weve ever slept on and if you simply quotmustquot have one theres a gift catelog where you can order anything in your room  One of the window blinds didnt work and the cost of the in room wireless connection was prohibitive but we all agreed the room was pleasant BUT a couple major concernsWe had reserved two rooms and I confirmed it personally the night before  But when we arrived they only had one room for us  After some tense moments they gave us a handicap accessible room much roomier than the other standard room but had a shower that flooded the bathroom floor but it was located on the opposite side of the hotel from our friends  Disappointing Do not eat in the restaurant unless you have lots of time and money  For both dinner and breakfast we were the only people in the dining room but each meal took almost two hours  The food was good    but very over the top and ghastly expensive  My small bowl of oatmeal at breakfast was   A safety concernBecause this room only had one bed we ordered a roll away cot for our son  While my family went sightseeing I laid down for a bit I locked the door but didnt bolt it  Suddenly without a knock or a quotyoo hooquot the door burst open and an employee with the cot just walked right in He was as shocked to see me curled up in bed as I was to see him He apologised for not knocking quotI didnt think anyone would be herequot but it was scary Yes I shouldve bolted the door but come on management    teach your people to knockWe all agree    the W was nice and has a lot of potential  But there were too many downsides for the money  We wont stay there again  
N => W is great When you live in nowheresville Indiana ha ha you stay at the best anytime you get the chance  Well for my birthday we ided to go to the CubsSox game and got a set of rooms at the W Chicago   City Center  Since we had  people in our room we were given a handicapp room  The room was clean well lit and large  The bathroom was also large which might be because it was a handicapp room the water to me atleast was cold when I wanted it cold and hot when I wanted it hot  The beds were large and very comfortable due to the downy bedding  The art o or of the hotel continues to the rooms with large bampw photos on the walls  The only thing that was disappointing about the room was that the quotviewquot that was supposed to come with our room was of the courtyard no yard involved just a wet cement floor  The lobby was one of the most amazing rooms Ive ever seen with dim lighting to go along with the art o theme  The staff in genreal were very kind and helpful  The concierge was very helpful with directions advice on what to see etc The only bad thing was that there were no vending machines   but everything was in sale in your room   for a lot more money The on site restraunt I found to be wonderful  Since I am from nowhere Indiana a  star restraunt is a new experience  I loved the quotmodern Tuscanquot idea but it would have been nice to have the chance to get a steak without a inadecrust though I do recommend the herb garlic crust  The meal for  of us was approx    dollars  When we went back for Breakfast   hows almost  sound   but Ive never had Salmon for breakfast before ha  The food was very good and since this was probably a once in a lifetime thing we cant complain The cost to park your car was rediculous   either pay  bucks a day or try and find your own spot  we did get a thing of complementary water for the car though atleast I hope it was complementary I havent seen the bill Overall I thought it was a pretty good hotel though they have a little work to do  
N => The W needs a change in security staff The amenities were alright but they have some serious problems with thier security staff We had two arate incidents with the security staff during a one night stay at the hotel In the first incident two security guards got very nasty with some family members and myself  They were very abusive and I could swear were trying to pick a fight In the second incident we were asked to leave the lobby bar area because there was an African American event going on  I asked if it was closed to hotel guests and they said no  We were asked to leave because we were white  
N => If I were a vampire I wouldve called this place home  I will evaluate this hotel with respect to the following overall feeling of the hotel location quality of room and amenities  To give you perspective on the reason for our visit my husband and I stayed here for a weekend visit to Chicago Overall feeling of the hotel   Like others have said it s a clubby lounge type of atmosphere  The W hotel is intended to be trendy so if you book this hotel expect that type of atmosphere  The lobby itself is impressive with extremely high ceilings and modern furniture  In the background you ll hear loungeclub type music no matter what time of day and the entire lobby is dimly lit   just a little bit of light the rest of the room is illuminated by candles  The lobby looks ently maintained i e  it is clean and everything seems to be in good shape furniture floor walls etc   The people who work here all dress in black and have earphones to communicate with each other  I think the intended look here is  cool and trendy  to match the furniture and lighting scheme though to me it seemed a bit overdone and contrived  The guys out front sometimes open doors for you sometimes do not depending on how close they were to the door as you approached  The front desk staff and concierges seem to be friendly and courteous interested in making sure you have a nice stay  So my first impression is that this hotel had a bit of attitude  Not anything to run away from but something to keep in mind  Location    The Loop  is dead during the weekends as my husband and I have come to find out  You are within walking distance to the elevated rail system to Midway which is convenient if you flew in from there the Sears Tower the Art Institute and Millennium Park  That was about it though  If you wanted to go bar hopping window shopping or have more than  or  choices as far as places to eat you would have to either take the L hop a cab or walk  If you didn t you d be bored out of your mind once evening hit  If you re only in Chicago for a weekend AND want to explore the city at night without having to take the L everywhere I d suggest booking elsewhere  The neighborhood is a ghost town on the weekends which actually was a bit scary when you factor in the numerous beggars floating through the streets Quality of Room   The hallways leading to the rooms were way too dark  If I were a vampire this type of darkness would ve been perfect  The rooms were tiny though I was OK with the size we re in the city after all  The room itself was worn down  You could see the paint on the radiator units chipping away and the walls were a bit dirty and worn  The hotel room seemed clean though it felt dingy   almost like there was a coating of dirt and grime that had been left uncleaned for so long it just became part of the place  Hard to explain  The lighting was barely adequate  Even with all the lights on one of which did not work you still yearned for a bit more light  The bed was extremely comfortable probably the most comfortable of all hotels I ve ever stayed at  We had an abundance of pillows too which for me was great  There is only one phone in the room and it is on the desk which is a walk away from the bed  It would ve been nice to have a phone on the nightstand table  The walls were paper thin and if you have a room that can be joined to another request a different room  My husband and I could make out exact words and phrases of the people in the room next to us  The bathroom was a ent size relatively speaking as was the closet  Water pressure shower was weak though that might ve been because they had that rain spray shower head  The towels were really rough but plentiful  You get a bathrobe only  to use while you re there which is a tad softer than the towels but not much  Amenities   The coffee maker in the room had a coffee pot that liked to leak out coffee  They offered afreg and various Tazo teas for your consumption though if you used any of it they did not replenish or provide you with clean cups etc  Plus the coffee maker was not plugged in the first night   and trying to squeeze behind the wall unit to plug it in was not fun though probably comical to watch The bath amenities were OK  Bliss products were OK though the containers they came in were too hard for you to squeeze any of the product out  No real complaints there though they refilled what you needed  Wireless was obnoxiously expensive at   We didn t try room service but saw the menu and noticed that it was too expensive for room service  We did not use the gym or any other facilities so we can t comment to their quality  OH one more thing  If you buy  Hotel VIP  tix for the Sears Tower from the concierge and are told that you don t have to wait in line be advised that the line they are referring to is the actual line to go up the Tower  You still have to wait in line to use the elevator to get up to the ticket booths AND you have to wait in line to get past security which when we were there was more than an hour wait  Just thought I d mention that CONCLUSION We booked this through Hotwire at a tremendously discounted rate  As a discount hotel I d say this place was barely adequate to OK  However at the rates they normally charge I would say steer away from this place  This W is totally undeserving of the higher level hotel classification   it just does not have the quality of roomsfacilities and service to warrant it  
N => Sleeping to a disco whistle We rented two rooms for two nights  My husband and I upgraded our online booking with an email offering quotfor just  more you can have the super excellence roomquot  Our travel companions didnt upgrade and ended up in a room in the back of the hotel with no view and relative silence  We ended up with a room on the th floor overlooking the street below where the concierge stood in the street blowing a whistle non stop to hail cabs  It was ember and frigidly cold a cabbie cannot possibly hear a whistle from his cab with a rolled up window  We complained to the front desk and they said theyd get on it right away  The whistle blows never ceased  We went out for a refined dinner wanted to have a nightcap in the living roomlobby but came back to the hotel to find it had been transformed to a nightclub complete with pounding music and scantily clad cocktail waitresses It was so crowded and loud that we couldnt even discuss what to do instead   I received an email asking about my satisfaction and although Ive written TWICE to the manangement I heard absoloutely nothing back  Save your money and go to a hotel that CARES  Who needs hipper than thou attitude like this 
N => Extremely Awful Experience  Stayed at the W to celebrate our engagementamp booked a King suite for the we  After flying in from Texas and a long jerky expensive cab ride we were met with a lobby full of female softball players lying on the floor and empty food containers perched on the furniture  We provided our reservation info and Starwood membership   at the desk and were quickly handed a key card by the disinterested staff member  I attempted to clarify our reservation and received only a nod  When we opened the door we saw that the bed was not a King but a quotfullquot size mattress and the room was so small that you had to orient your body sideways to scoot between the bed and wall  There was a layer of dust on the dark furniture the AC didnt work and the bathroom stall smelled of   something  We went downstairs and after standing in line with luggage for  minutes requested another room  The unhelpful staffmember became rude and suggested that I had requested a quotdouble quot I provided the printed receipt showing my reservation for a King Suite and again provided my membership number  After arguing with the girl she finally called the   number for the website and argued with them that there were quotno more King Suites availablequot and I quotwould have to takequot the tiny room  I requested to be moved to another location but was told that all she had to do was quotoffer a roomquot and since she had done that  she would not relocate us nor would she refund any of the prepayment for the room  At this point my bride  to be began to cry it was pm and we had not eaten since the AM  Exhausted we gave in amp stayed in the tiny room for  nights  It was awful  On the third night at pm we were upgraded to the King Suite I had payed for  which smelled of feet  We flew out the next morning  Weeks later I noticed that the W had double charged my credit card for the stay which had been prepayed  The nighte was not over It took numerous calls and another  weeks to get the charges off of my card  and required ME to copy and fax receipts and my credit card statement to the billing office  I would advise anyone to look elsewhere for a place to stay  We now live in Chicago and know of dozens of beautiful and accomodating alternatives  Do yourself a favor  go elsewhere you likely cannot do any worse  
N => Overall a very disappointing stay Many of the aspects of our stay were so bad as to be a little funny  We could only lh about it afterwards though We booked our room through priceline  When we arrived we were greeted promptly and sent straight toour room  This has to be the designated priceline room  Directly across from the elevator it took our breath away  Actually this was because the room was so so small that a full breath removed the oxygen from the entire room  A path about  feet wide around the quotqueenquot bed was all the space that there was  To this add a heat register that made so much noise as to make sleeping difficult a wall mirror which had apparently come off of its mounting and just leaned against the wall an inoperable phone probably to prevent complaints  I really cant imagine where we would have put our luggage Needless to say we went down to the desk to make other arrangements  We were offered a couple of extra cost upgrades  We opted for the quotmega kingquot which was smoking but we were desperate  That room was actually quite nice but unbelievably hot  We slept with the heat off and the window open and we were still warm  There was no hair dryer in the room  A phone call to housekeeping and  minutes produced a hair dryer which didnt work  We gave up before the second replacement arrived A few positives The quotstylequot department brought us a very nice deodorizer to help neutralize smoke odors   worked great  The second room was quite spacious and yes the toiletries were nice However it is impossible to offset all of the other problems  It is very difficult to accept this hotel as a four star establishment  They have a serious quality controlmaintenance issue at this facility  Until this is resolved we and everyone else should stay away 
N => Club MTV w paper thin walls    My girlfriend and I flew in from a trip with very little sleep on a Friday afternoon  From the moment we walked into the hotel it was just a little over whelming its like a bad Music video and not very relaxing  I suppose if I was Lindsy Lohan or looking to be seen the lobby might seem normal  You feel like your at a bad rave party  I wanted to tell the desk worker nice looking young lady with a headset on and low cut black dress quotyou do realize its am rightquotMoving on to the rooms   Brief cliff note version  We were so exhausted by our trip that we went out for dinner down the street came back and went to bed  The beds are sooo comfortable as are all the amenities  At am I was woken up by loud talking the talking turned into the couple getting it on  The room was completly dark which is good  but the noise was so loud and close that I actually felt like the person was in our room    Heck we could hear them breathing gross  Desk worker informed us they have issues wih the noise cause of the wallsIn the morning we changed rooms   times until we got a corner roomUnless you are in a corner room it will feel like you are in a walk in closet 
N => What a Disappointment My husband and I were very disappointed in this hotel  We were expecting a four star luxury hotel and found it to be anything but  The room was so small it was uncomfortable  The only place to sit was on an uncomfortable office chair  The bathroom was so small that there wasnt even room for the bath mat on the floor  Getting ready to go out for the evening required an incredible balancing act The lobby was so dark I felt like we were entering a cave  If this had been a budget hotel it might have been acceptable but at the price we paid it was totally unacceptable  We will never stay here again  
N => Good experence comfy beds I was afraid to stay at this hotel after reading a few reviews on here but I found the hotel outstanding in many catagories  We got the room for   through priceline  The day before we took the room we asked for two beds and no smoking  They gave us a corner room which was huge  Our bathroom was at least half the size of the room  It was room   We asked for extra coffee in the room and they gave us like  or  packs of coffee no questions asked  I didnt care much for the location though  Also the bars had bartenders that were young women who seemed like they wanted to be somewhere else  
N => W City Center We stayed at the W City Center over Labor Day weekend and got a wonderful rate we eventually upgraded to a Spectacular Room but it still cost us under  a night so considering what you get I thought the hotel was just fine but if we paid full price than I can foresee the problem many reviewers had with the hotel  However for us it was just the right note because it was close to just about everything whether it was walking distance a cab or train ride away  We did not have a problem with the staff in general however we did use the conierge service each night we stayed  The first guy who helped us was very nice and went out of his way but the other two we encountered could use a seminar on customer service  It wasnt that they were bad they were just indifferent to our questions and acted as if we bothered them in some way  The front desk people were spot on from the minute we checked in to the time they held our bags because we didnt leave until later that night  And the bar Whiskey Blue could use some help    the people were nice but the bartendar is not very good at all    the worst mojito Ive ever had  Considering we didnt pay full price the hotel was great    walking distance to Sears Tower the El is right there and we did not hear it at all    we saw Wicked that night so we were able to walk back from the theater we felt very safe downtown even shall Fields is within walking distance so for some to complain about the location either they must not like to walk or didnt know where to go  In any case there are better hotels around the city we had breakfast at Hotel Adiago sp and it was adorable but if you manage to get a cheap room like we did you cant beat the W City Center  
N => Horrible   Horrible   Horrible Stayed here for  nights at the end of e and had the worst hotel experince I have ever had   Returned to our room after some meetings only to find that the door was left open and an unrequested rollaway bed had been placed in the room  Notified the front desk of the this and they responded quickly however the staff member offered to make amends by sending up some champage and fruit basket   hours later when nothing arrived I call down and was informed that he needed to get approval still  I told him to forget it as we were heading out to dinner  He appologized and promised it would be awaiting us when we returned  A warm bottle of champage was in our room and that was it  The following day after returning from meetings I was stopped by hotel security at the front doors and questioned in front of a crowd of people quotas to why I was there and where I was goingquot I told him that I was going into the hotel since I was a paying guest there The security guard hesitated looked to another security guard and moved out of my way with no appology or explaination  I reported what happened to the Welcome Office Manager   K  Williams who was appologetic and assured me it should never have happened  He then promised to personally investigate what had happend and get back to me that day  With no response  hours later I called down to the front desk and was told that Mr  Williams had left for a meeting  When I explained that I was awaiting his reply the person helping me promised to look into the matter and respond within  minutes   minutes later I was told that the security guard had left for the day and that someone would get back to me the next day  No one ever did When I reported the incidents to the general manager of the hotel in writing it took him almost  months to respond with a form letter offering me a quotcomplimentary one night stay quot That could never make up for what I enduredI would NOT recommend that anyone stay at this hotel I have been treated with more respect in a youth hostel Dont waste your Money 
N => Ws miss I love the lobby of the W City Center  It is seems very trendy and has a certain vibe that is funky  That said the room I was in left a lot to be desired  The funkiness of the lobby did not transfer to the rooms  I guess I was expecting too much after reading the raves about the W brand  The room was described as not too big not too small sort of in between  HELLO in between is a great stretch try tiny   and if this was the in between I would really hate to see a small room  The bed and furniture I use that word loosely took up the entire space  The carpet in the room was grey but that could not hide the traffic and frequent attempts at cleaning  The room also smelled stale and musty  The bathrooms are a bit tight too and not sparkly clean  Not dirty but not that really clean look that makes you feel comfortable after having used it Hotel lobbies should complement their rooms  You owe your customers that favor I will visit the W again but only to the lobby  
N => What a great hotel We were pick pocketed while exiting the subway in Chicago  We dont carry much cash but our credit cards were gone also  The folks at the W were fantastic  They cashed our check which had been nixed by telecheck because it was drawn on the account from which the credit card had been stolen  They sent complimentary fruit cheese and wine to our room  Everyone there was so accomodating and kind  Beside all this the room was beautiful and the bedding was so comfortable We WILL return to the W on Adams in Chicago  
N => If you want a W in Chicago   choose the Lakeshore or even better   the Sofitel After having a great stay at the W Lakeshore we thought wed give the W City Center a try  BIG MISTAKE We booked a room with a king bed in the Mega category  We received a Starwood Gold upgrade to an Alternative suite Room  which had a Queen bed  When I called the welcome desk to enquire if they had any other suites with a King I was told that they were too busy to speak with me   and they would call me back   minutes later I was told that ALL of their suites have King beds   and that their engineering dept  must have changed the bed in our room without informing them  Which sounded a bit like a lie   the bedroom could not accommodate a king bed  We waited another  minutes for an Ambassador to come up to our room with keys to another suite room  which had a King bed   but this suite was considerably smaller  What the W calls a suite at this location is really just two small connecting hotel rooms  It was apparent that our new room hadnt been used in a while   everything was covered in a layer of dust   including the mirror in the parlour room   which someone hand written Clean Me in the dust  We ided to make the best of it and unpacked  The ice machine on the th floor was broken so I had to climb the stairs in search of a working machine  I know that W thinks their dark corridors are cool but when I was wandering the halls looking for an ice machine I felt unsafe   if their was a fire how would you be able to see at all The next morning I was awakened to sound of guest room doors being repeatedly opened and slammed shut  After counting  loud door SLAMS   I went out to the hall to see who was doing this   SURPRISE it was housekeeping I asked her to to be more courteous   as some people are still sleeping   and she just stared at me   no apology  We ided that we would be happier if we moved to the W Lakeshore   and called downstairs to ask if they could make the arrangements  I was again told that they were too busy to speak with me   and they would call me back  When they did call back   I was told that our rate would not be honoured at the W Lakeshore nor would we receive an upgrade there  If we wanted a suite at the W Lakeshore it was   per night  At that point we ided that we were moving to the Sofitel and checked out  Our bill was wrong   double charged for Internet and not billed for parking  They even tried to charge us an early check out fee which they graciously waived  Would NEVER return  
N => Good if you get the right room My girlfriend and I stayed here for  nights in total in  arate stays in il   We booked through hotwire and got a good rate of   a night  The first stay we got a very nice room with a king size bed one bathroom and another room housing a second toilet and sink and also the wardrobe space  The second time we were told we had a quotwonderfulquot room reserved for us with a queen bed but when we got up there the room was tiny and the bed was only a ft  wide one  I thought queen sizes were ft  We paid  per night to upgrade to a quotsuperquot I think room which was even better than our first one  We had room service a couple of times and everything was very good  So why the  blob rating It is mainly because of the attitude of the hotel not the staff to the fact wed booked through Hotwire  be Im naive to expect anything other than the worst rooms when you book through Hotwire but we did seem to get the smallest room on the floor on our second stay  Also you cant get Starwood points if you book through Hotwire either so I didnt join the program and wont be going back to a W in any hurry  This is a great hotel with great food and great staff and with a little more generosity of spirit in the hotels policies I would have unhesitatingly have given it a   
N => Just Our Style My husband amp I stayed here the first weekend of ember   It was pretty darn cool the staff was extremely friendly although not perfect  A few errors were made during our check out amp it took more than a minute to get our bags while rushing to the airport for our flight home  But our room was clean you have already heard about the great beds our breakfast room service was timely hot amp delicious  We enjoyed the Whiskey Blue Bar both nights of our stay  The or the smells amp lighting made us feel right at home  We are looking forward to our stay at the W Seattle amp W San Francisco this summer 
N => Our Sales Meeting was fantastic Heard a lot of positive things about the quotWquot Chicago and ided to hold our ober sales meeting there  people  Glad we did  Service was second to none  The staff gladly and quickly met all our requests and needs  Our conference coordinator was extremely helpful  Well be back Joe CarvalhoSr  Director Sales Operations amp FinanceSara Lee Coffee 
N => Wonderful stay  This being my husband amp I first trip to Chicago we ided to check out reviews on the net On looking we wondered if the W City Centre was going to be the hotel for us even though it had been recomended by some friends  We arrived early afternoon greeted warmly by the doorman amp followed by front desk  So far so good taken to our room everything was spotless just as us Brits like itdelighted as we were staying for  nights Our whole experience at the W was fantastic staff were always extremely polite amp went out of their way to be helpful  we did note how young they seemed however it works amp thats what really countsYou can hear the loop thats all part of city life  We have been fortunate to stay all over the world in many different hotels could not fault the W City Centre in any way  
N => W whenever whatever When they answer the phone whenever whatever they mean it  Service it not an after thought at this property  Add in the unique sleeping rooms beds to good to be believed and meeting space that is very versatile  What more could any planner ask for  From the moment the doorman saysquotWelcome to the Wquot you begin a hotel experience that will be worth remembering  
N => had a great stay had a great stay  read some of the other reviews AFTER i made my reservation so i expected the worst  but i had a great sized room the staff was super friendly and the el was a faint sound in the distance  i had no weird incidents or stains like some others reported  all and all id stay there again  its not for people who dont like a club in the lobby or super dimly lit hallways    its a hip hotel aiming at a younger urban sophisticate crowd  if thats not you you should not come to this hotel 
N => Loved it Loved the W Chose this hotel for its proximity to a training session I was attending  Stayed  nights in ruary  The room was small but comfortable  Loved the building the lobby and the exercise room  As a female travelling alone I felt comfortable and safe the entire time  This was not the case during a previous trip at a different hotel The service was impeccable  I have never been so impressed with service  From check in to the concierge   the staff was amazing  I dont think I will be able to stay anywhere else when visiting the Chicago area I very highly recommend this hotel  
N => Complete disappointment I made reservations for me and my  girls through the W s central reservations number  I asked for an early check in and was told that we could check in at   We arrived at  and I was told that the room was not ready  I mentioned that my reservation was for early check in  I was told that I should have never been told that I could check in early because their rooms are never ready early and their check in times are only guaranteed at   The clerk then offered to downgrade my room from a Mega to a standard  I refused and said that I would rather wait because I wanted a Mega  They offered to request a rush for  and asked if they could store our luggage  Hoping to some kill time by doing something fun we went to the concierge to ask about the bus tours  He was not very helpful and didn t seem very knowledgeable about what is offered  I told him that I was interested in the Double ker bus but he kept insisting that the free trolley would be better for us  I really wanted a narrative tour and told him so  I asked him where to catch the bus and he said  out there in front of the Sears Tower   Well directions and street names would have been more helpful since I was not at all familiar with the area  We ended up asking people on the street for help in finding the Tour s payment center and bus stop  I spent  on the not so good tour in order to kill time waiting for our room to be cleaned  The tour company over sells their tickets so we waited in the hot sun  minutes for the rd bus to come by before there was enough room on the extremely over crowded bus for us to get on We returned to the hotel at   The lobby was completely crowded and reminded me of a campus on the first day of college  I waited and waited to get to the front desk  While waiting the concierge noticed me standing there and came over to ask if he could assist me with anything  I told him I was still trying to check in  He was a little surprised because he thought we had already checked in  He brought  bottles of cold water for us while we waited we were a group of   Finally I made it to check in  minutes waiting and again I was told my room was not ready  I complained and said that this was unacceptable  The clerk left and returned a minute later and told me the room would be ready in  minutes they were doing a final walk through to make sure the room was clean  He said that several people checked out late and the housekeepers were not able to get in to clean  I went to the business center to check my email and then we sat and sat and sat out in the busy lobby  Finally I stood in the line again to check the status of my room that was promised in  minutes  By now it is   It was apparent from the conversation with the couple in front of me that they were experiencing the same problem  Finally a rd person was helping me again I am asked my name  I was furious  His apology did not seem genuine  I mentioned that I was paying  for essentially what is supposed to be  hours and that my room was not available for more than  of those hours not counting the promised early check in and told him that I spent  on the tour to give them time to clean the room by   He offered to reduce my bill by   I told him to not bother  He then said he could take of  and that was the best he could do  I again told him not to bother  That if all that the W could do for this kind of snafu is to reduce my bill by  than forget it I d rather pay full price but I would never be back  He said  okay that is your choice   I was really wanting to hear a sincere apology more than anything  Okay finally we get a room key  We enter the room and   Wow The floors were not vacuumed  There was obvious dirt everywhere  I called the whateverwhenever number and demanded that someone come with a vacuum  The  Head Stylist  housekeeper came to the room and looked around  She insisted that she was there when the housekeeper vacuumed so she knew that it had been vacuumed  I told her that I would not dispute her but that the floor is clearly very dirty  I asked if they vacuumed in the dark and she said no  She pointed to an area behind the front door to show the vacuum cleaner k as proof that the floor had been cleaned  I said to her that we would just pickup the dirt ourselves because we were tired and I was already upset  She finally acknowledged that the floors were very dirty and said that they were rushed so be they didn t do a good job  They finally vacuumed the floor  The Head Stylist offered to send us on a complimentary boat ride  I lined because we already had plans  She then offered us a complimentary meal at the We Ristorante and offered to still take off the  that I had refused earlier  Other complaints There was a dirty towel in the bathroom A huge brown streak down the folded side of a white towel  Yuck The dark purple blanket was dirty and hairy  The very small closet was almost impossible to open  The knob would not turn so we had to yank the door open with all might  The   internet web TV like service was a total waste of money  It was very slow and extremely limited  Phone calls were   local and   for using the   for the calling card  There was no liner for the ice bucket  The view was horrible  Nothing but the L tracks the top of the roof next door and construction work down below  The L train was very loud  The entire hotel was very dark  The location was not very good for a leisure trip because it is too far away from Michigan Ave  They don t offer a shuttle service it takes  to  minutes to get your car from the valet and parking is  per day  Even the common areas were dirty during our entire stay  It appears that they are severely short on cleaning staff  By the way the same vacuum cleaner k that the Head Stylist pointed to when we checked in was still there undisturbed when we checked out  No one walks in the corner wall behind the door DuhThis is the worst stay that I ve ever had and I would have to say that I am most disappointed by the lack of professionalism and training from the staff  They are not customer focused they never remembered or called me by my name their apologies were insincere appeasements and being a Starwood Preferred Guest meant absolutely nothing to the outcome of the situation  I will never stay at a W Hotel again and would definitely discourage anyone I know from staying at a W  I will pay more attention to hotel reviews from now on  I will be traveling to Chicago again on Labor Day weekend and we plan to stay at the Swissotel  
N => Ditto to  yuck  reviewer The st room they sent me to was so small I couldnt get my lugguge thru the entranceway into the bedroom  Dark Purple walls with a view of nothing but an office buildings windows no matter how you cranned your neck denied even the thinnest ray of sunlight  Tons of hair on the blankets  Strange stains in weird places  Dirty towel in the bathroom  Thin walls that let thru the neighbors voices even when they were speaking in a normal tone  When they began to lh and scream I asked for another room  The nd room was better than the st by far but it was also very small situated directly over the L tracks remember the scene from even with Pitt Paltrow amp Freeman with a view of the next buildings roof top which was under construction and contained debris  I wouldnt walk barefoot in either of the rooms  You probably dont want to stay here for more than  a night  Instead try the W Lakeshore  It was fabulous  years ago anyway  
N => Very nice hotel I was pleased  
N => Have to check it out  
N => Incredible hotel Incredible experience  
N => Watch out  
N => Close to the  L      not a plus  
N => GREAT Experience  
N => Enjoyed but concerned with some of the bad reviews I had a great trip with family and teenrestaurant was goodyes it is a quotbar scenequot lower level but no one was out of controlrestaurant was a little slow sometimes but overall good and food was goodI get concerned with the bad reviews as when I read that customer service doesnt care I equate that with dirty bathroomsI would go backyes elevators are slow but come on its not that bad imo 
N => Completely underwhelmed The W Lakeshore hotel was a large disappointment from the moment we arrived  The hotel entrance was a mess with cars parked in every direction while we waited  minutes on the street  Check in agents were unpleasant and did not provide us with any information on the hotel including where to find the elevators  Elevators were slow  Walls were thin and we heard everything going on in the halls until all hours of the morning  The bathroom was tiny and had to step over the toilet to enjoy the weak shower  The only bright spot the Bliss toiletries  
N => Kudos to Claudia from the concierge services Overall our stay was very pleasant  We encountered one hiccup and that was immediately addresses by Claudia at the concierge  I cant say enpugh of her  She even came up to our room and brought our delivery that was hung up at the security  Good service and personnel made this stay memorable  Keep investing on the best people  
N => Very Hip Place to say with Positive attitudes I wanted to give a review since I almost canceled our stay due to the many negative ones listed on this site We were here to celebrate a th birthday  In total we had  rooms  We requested to stay in the same vicinity and we were all on the same floor  Requested the  complimentary Acura car rides which were prompt and pleasant  Requested coffee make and brought up in a timely manner  In other words quotthe anythingquot requests were granted and we were very pleased with our experience The rooms were very contemporary  A bit worn but clean and comfortable Love the bed I am a quotWestinquot girl and prefer the more traditional but I loved the quothip vibequot of the hotel lobby and atmoshere  My husband and I had a velous suite with a great view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  It was also excellent to entertain the group before going out  Michigan Ave four blocks away so the location was pretty convenient Dont be frightened to give this place a try  We will certainly go back sometime 
N => A Unique and enjoyable stay A very interesting hotel  Service was great Be sure to arrange for a free ride to local attractions in the hotels Acura MDX  The only problem was the bed was so high we needed a stool to get in Dont miss the unusual lobby restrooms 
N => Great Style Loved the design of the rooms Small but not to crowded  
N => stay away Good location   horrible service  Had bikes stolen from property hotel could have cared less  Room was nicely orated but soundproofing must be poor   could hear everything in the hallway  Really not worth the money  
N => Nice Hotel good location We thought this hotel was in a great location and it was pretty easy to get to from the airport  love public transportation It is situated right across from the water just the road in between so it was lovely  We didnt have any issues with noise or anything either which was nice  we didnt try the restaurant so have no opinion on that  we got a good deal from priceline com too so that was a bonus The rooms were nicely orated too kind of a swanky type place with being really modern and quotshinyquot  I wouldnt call it a  star hotel but it was nice  The only downside if there must be one is the staff is mediocre at best but we got done what needed to be done they just arent overly enthusiastic about anything  One of the valet guys was really awesome though but he was the only one that stood out as great  So if you dont need to a lot of attention this is a great place  Were pretty easy going so it doesnt matter to us  Oh and only free internet in the lobby not in your room  U have to pay to get it in your room We also did the near north walking food tour which was alot of fun and not to expensive then we hit the free zoo after that  That took up a whole day and was great for sight seeing and learning more about the city i recommend this tour And it was only pp 
N => Unimpressed We stayed at the W on our anniversary because we live in the suburbs and didnt want the long drive home after a late evening dinner  We arrived at about ten to four and we were told they we running  minuets behind  Considering check in is at three this was pretty poor  An hour and a half past the listed check in time really Thats pathetic for a large hotel chain   Our room was ok dark and pretty small  After dinner we went to Whiskey Sky which was a tiny joke and then back to the room when I ided to take a shower  I turned on the water and it was so loud I thought the pipes were going to break Im positive our neighbors could hear it because I heard the same sound coming from another room the next morning   Finally we had breakfast the next day at the restaurant in the lobby  for an orange juice give me a break And the stupid benches that the waiters have to slide out and slide in for you to sit down ridiculous  This place is trying too hard and falling short  I was glad to leave  
N => Management does not care about their customers Check in time was at   We did not get our room till  and my parents could not get into their still   We were told we could get in our rooms at   When talking to management she had a oh well attiitude and did nothing  The rooms were nice but the service was absolutely horrible  Do not plan on going anywhere in a hurry because it will take a while to get on and off the elevators  It cost  to get on the interent also  We will not stay here again 
N => Dark Dismal Stay away We stayed because it was close to Navy Pier and we heard the W was a quottrendyquot place to stay  quotTrendyquot in this case means particle board furniture with shoe polish touchups accented with non functional window blinds blaring elevator music cough drop and moth ball smelling hallways dusty glasses and   bottles of water  Room service never showed so we left to get breakfast  
N => Over Rated My husband and I stayed at the W on his birthday and I have to say it wasnt even worth the price I paid thru hotels com I got it for almost  dollars less than the advertised price from the hotel  Even then it wasnt worth it I checked in early and they DID have a room ready which was nice  However I paid for a king room and still got  doubles  The view was nice but I could hear the jackhammering even up on the th floor  I called the front desk when I got to my room and saw it was a  doubles I called the quotWhateverWheneverquot and reminded them that I had reserved a king room  They told me theyd get right back to me     minutes later I called and it still wasnt taken care of  So I said forget it  So quotWhatever Wheneverquot I guess is only if they feel like it  The room had an odd smell  I know it was supposed to be retro but it was just really kind of cheap trailer looking  Not impressed at all  On the up side valet parking was free Other than that wouldnt recommend this one at all  Very disappointed  
N => Terrible Customer Service Front Desk and Management I just got back from my quotexperiencequot at the W Lakeshore and I am less than pleased  Upon checkin we were not able to receive our key  Our trip was pre paid for by my father in law as a birthday gift and our names were not on the reservation  His name was the only name on the reservation due to a hotel error  Due to quotsecurity reasonsquot we could not check in until he contacted the hotel to give approval  Understandable to an extent but again our names were not on the reservation due to a booking mistake  I was ok with this mistake when the lady at the desk bought us drinks while we waited to get a hold of my father in law who is a lawyer who happened to be stuck in court  After enjoying a few drinks at the bar I walked through the lobby to find a bathroom and all of our bags which had been unloaded out of my car by valet were sitting in the middle of the lobby completely unattended  It was check in time and there were at least  people in the lobby  Any number of things could have been stolen I alerted the front desk of this and they asked me what I wanted them to do  The girl at the desk talked to me like I was not a real guest and stomped over to her manager and clearly seemed like I was asking her to do something out of the question  Her manager also acted like I was being out of line for asking for my bags to be stored   hours later we were able to check into the room and waited over an hour to get our bags delivered to the room  At the end of our stay we ended up paying  a day for parking even though when we booked the room there was a promotion for free parking during our stay  The front desk asked me to quotprove itquot in exact words  Shouldnt they have record of their promotions that they advertise  Should the guest really need documentation Again our trip was a gift we did not have any confirmation information with us but the reason why we picked the hotel was because of the free parking promotion  On the website that we booked the room with it still lists the promotion which is still valid for a few more weeks Overall totally incompetent snobby front desk and management that think that since they work somewhere nice means they can be snobs  News flash our stay at their hotel cost more than their monthly paycheck Our waitress was nice and the man who delivered our bags to our room was also nice but they were the only exceptions There are MUCH better places in Chicago to stay I will never spend another penny at a W hotel 
N => Really nice great location A friend and I stayed here during Lollapalooza over the weekend  Id been worried about the bathroom situation the little shutters as opposed to a door but we didnt have any problems with that  We had booked through hotels com so I was pleasantly surprised to get a room on the th of  floor  I would have thought those would be given to more VIP guests  Obviously the location is wonderful there were telescopes by the elevators so you could look out over Navy Pier and the lake it was a quick walk to clubs restaurants and shopping and cabs were easy to come by  I was excited for the Acura car service but it only ran   so I never got to use that  I loved the Bliss bath products but there was only one robe in the bathroom which seemed odd  The staff was very helpful when we had questions and while the breakfast I ordered from room service arrived quickly it wasnt that great  definitely not worth all the surcharges tacked on to the already expensive price tag  We made use of the Starbucks and   down the block as well as the parking lot that was day cheaper than the hotel rate I am not a luxury hotel type person and Ill probably go back to my Hampton Inns after this but it was definitely a fun splurge thanks to the hotels com rate  
N => The worse W Hotel EVER   Horrible With the exception of the lake view from my roomwhich has nothing to do with the hotel I hated everything about this hotel  It is was noisy kids running around garbage bags and cleaning cart in the middle of the hallway on my floor all morning long     not to mention they start knocking doors to clean at am if you forget the Do Not Disturb sign  I did not dare to order food  It took  minutes to get some coffee bags not even a pot A few other things  I am over  and look   I went up to the whiskey bar roof top where there were only  people sitting and having a drink  I was asked for an ID before the hello The other place where you can have a drink is the lobby    it is a zoo  Vegas cheap hotel lobby You get the picture  I am used to W Hotels in New York  Chicago Lakshore or is OK    not even close but only grown ups should be allowed Horrible  The worse W ever  I will NEVER go back and I split my time between NYC and Chicago  
N => stink stank stunk We went to Chicago for my best friends dhters wedding  They reserved a block of  rooms  Now my understanding is a block is a group of rooms on the same floor or at least within a few floors of each other  Not in this case  NO ONE was on the same floor Not the bride amp her bridesmaids not the groom amp his groomsmen not the family nor friends Before our arrival the mother of the bride had requested coffee pots be in  of the rooms   ours the grandparents an uncle  This was confirmed in a email there would be coffee pots upon check in  NOT The morning after our first night there we called again to request a coffee pot  An hour later a gentleman arrived with a fresh pot of coffee stating he was sorry for the inconveniece and would get us a room coffeemaker ASAP  It finally arrived about dinner time  The bride had made quotwelcome giftsquot for her wedding party that were to be placed in their rooms upon check in  The hotel stated they would be happy to deliver but there would be a  charge per item  No problem  However while in the lobby the bride noticed a man checking out that had not one but two of her welcome gifts He was NOT a member of the wedding party But she was sure charged for delivery During booking the mother of the bride had booked  Acuras for transportation purposes to the wedding  This too was confirmed by the hotel in an email  The day of the wedding we called to confirm our Acura reservation and was told quotwe dont have you down and we cant help you at this time quot We then asked if they could call and get us  van taxis for  as the wedding was to start at   They stated they would call right away  We went downstairs   no van taxis  Upon questioning the front desk we were told quotuh well we called  Sorry    quot OH MY GOD The hotel is quite beautiful but the service STINKS They dont even try to fix what is quotbrokenquot  They act as though they could care less if you are happy or not  
N => The View Restaurant was terrible  The View restaurant served the most horrible wine for glass  I first tried the Pinor Noir but it was horrible so I switched to the equally disappointing Cab  Randy Gerber should be embarrassed to have his name associated with this place  I stayed at the hotel for  nights and there were glasses piled up outside the door adjacent to mine until the time I checked out It was difficult sleeping because of the continuous overnight noise from Lakeshore Dr  
N => Didnt disappoint Just got back from our seven day trip in Chicago it was our first time to visit and I wanted to share my review of this hotel some great eating and sight seeing places to go to and some mistakes that we made  First of this hotel did not disappoint whatsoever  We found a great deal online to stay here and lets just say we either got really lucky or there was a fluke in the system  Its our first time to stay at a W hotel and we would definitely stay here again  Im not sure if Id pay for the normal price because its a bit steep but if we find the same deal again or WHEN I become a multi millionaire then definitely I would pick this hotel and location again  Things I liked about this hotel Location   Youre right in front of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier which is about a  min walk from the hotel  Michigan ave or the Magnificent Mile is about  or  blocks from the hotel   Acura service   we didnt find out about this service until our th night there but Acura partnered with the W hotel to take guest from the hotel to anywhere within the city for FREE  You just have to fill in a keting survey once and you can pretty much reserve as many times for them to drop you off at any location  Only thing is they dont do pick ups so you either walk or take a cab back to your hotel  Great lobby   we got here on a Thursday and left on the following Thursday  The whole time we were there there was always something happening down at the lobby bar even on a Monday  It seems to be the place where guests and locals hang out  It was a fun place to sit and hang around   Staff and Concierge   The staff was very friendly and attentive  When we checked in the lady at the desk gave us a free upgrade th floor lakeview  The W truly lives by the Whatever Whenever motto  They brought us everything we asked for at whatever hour band aids at am delivery menus at am whatever and didnt expect a tip  At times they dropped it off so quickly that I didnt even have a chance to tip  When I did they were very appreciative Things I didnt like about this hotel Pricey cocktail drinks   its like ordering drinks in L A  granted their mojito is one of the best Ive ever tasted and theyre actually known for making good mojitos  I think it cost  for one  Whiskey Blue was fairly small and didnt have a DJ  More like a lounge Chicago by far has the best eating places that can be found in any one city  Every place we went to   granted there was a lot of research done in our part   was phenomenal  One thing I would definitely miss about Chicago is the food  And we didnt even have the chance to try them all  Well be next time Great eating places that is a must try Ginos East   definitely worth the   minute wait for your deep dish  We got the meaty legend  Love the New York style pizza and this one was pretty close  Ive seen that they have several locations   not really sure which one was the original but we went to the one on the corner of Ontario and Wells  Dont forget to bring a ker as they allow you to tag their walls  Als Italian beef   one of the best   if not the best Italian beef thats out there  Definitely need to get it w hot peppers and dipped in the sauce  They even deliver  Ditkas   Im pretty sure everything in the menu is good but the one we tried was the pork chop and NY strip steak  Perfectly cooked and seasoned  The Mac n cheese w bacon is an absolute must  Trust me   Silver Palm   we saw quotNo Reservationsquot w Anthony Bourdain  If youve seen the Chicago show then you know which one Im talking about  A little scared that it was all hype but the three little pigs sandwich was amazing  One piece of advice make sure to ask for the gruyere cheese our mindless waitress forgot to mention they offer it w gruyere and cheddar cheese so we got the cheddar thinking it only comes with one kind  Oh and the onion rings were awesome too   Le Bouchon   Located in Wicker ParkBucktown  If you love French food you definitely have to go to this place  It is a hidden gem in a somewhat residential neighborhood  The place is very tiny and was always packed We got there an hour before our reservation thinking we could be seated early but to no luck  So make sure to make reservations  Really good price  Three course menu is about  On Tues all items are available for the prix fixe  The boudin noir is excellent  Things to see Art Institute   Probably one of the best condensed collections of famous paintings weve seen so far  Weve been to Metropolitan Museum in NY Louvre Museum and Musee dOrsay in Paris and Getty Museum in L A  But the Art Institute in Chicago was astounding  You must try to get here early as we got here late in the afternoon and there was not enough time to browse around and really appreciate the art  Definitely a must see  The Signature Room Hancock Tower   we wanted to see the city landscape and this is one of the best places to see it  You can also see the city view up in the Sears tower but you have to pay a fee to go to the observation k I think its person not sure So instead of paying  to get a   min view why not put it towards food and cocktail where you can sit down and enjoy the view for  min  or more Women the view from the restrooms  be the best  Other tips when visiting Chicago Taxi cabs   before going to Chicago we read in one of the guide books that the cab fare cost about   from O Hare to downtown which we found reasonable since its a  min  drive there  We could have taken the El train but with our big luggage s during rush hour Not sure if it was a good idea  Our cab driver seemed nice and was telling us there were two ways to get there  The short route or the long route  Logically we chose the short route but he told us that even though it was shorter in route it will take longer because of traffic  So we opted for the best route he recommends  Well when we got to the hotel our bill ended up being  We were shock at the cost and he reasoned the additional cost was for toll charges and blah blah blah  Well we found later on that we pretty much had been duped  The concierge told us the cost shouldve been around  and there were no toll charges to be charge  He said that the cab drivers in Chicago own their cabs so whatever money they make goes entirely to them  And any additional charge is all up to their discretion  Best bet is to find out the cost for shuttles make sure its a flat rate coz you dont want to be stuck in a traffic w the meter running  Or better yet make sure to pick Midway as your airport as it s only  min  from downtown  We took the El train back to OHare around  in the morning  Definitely worth it coz the train was free and clear    Do take the El train to go around the city   it only cost  person for a one day unlimited ride pass  Its definitely great if you re planning to venture out of downtown  Things we didn t like about Chicago Poor transit layout  Not as effective as other cities like New York London and Paris  Very few trains run eastwest  People were not as friendly as we thought they would be  Hope this helps     
N => out of  isnt bad I set my parents up at W Lakeshore for their anniversary just as a surprise  W takes the whole quotWOWquot factor to a new level  My parents were upgraded and sent a great tini amenity at check in  I called to make sure all was okay and happened to talk to Jenny Silvestri and she totally surprised and delighted them  This made the experience from special to spectacular  Thanks to Jenny  
N => A Good Winter Retreat We stayed at the W Lakeshore on uary   for a one night romantic getaway  We were able to check in to our room at am when we arrived which was a nice surprise  Front desk staff was polite but not overly friendly or welcoming  Our quotSpectacularquot room looked out at frozen Lake Michigan and had great views of Navy Pier especially lit up at night  The room was clean and the size was adequate  The bed was comfortable and overall we had a pleasant stay  The fitness center was packed with guests using the equipment    Ive never had to stand in line to use a hotel fitness center before The pool was closed for repairs which I would have liked to know before my arrival but we were given passes to the fitness club next door to the hotel  I didnt really enjoy walking in the uary air with wet hair after swimming but I guess it was the best the hotel could do  We were awakened at am by loud conversations in the hallway so I guess room soundproofing isnt the greatest  We enjoyed lunch at Fox amp Obel Cafe nearby walked to Navy Pier to see quotMacbethquot at Chicago Shakespeare Theatre and walked to Michigan Ave for shopping  All were pleasant easy walks from the hotel although they would have been more pleasant in the summer  Location was the biggest selling feature for us  Overall a nice retreat but I dont think well be going back anytime soon  
N => Nice   not spectacular We stayed at the W Lakeshore for our anniversary and booked their version of a romance package champagnechocolatesgoody baglate check out Upon arriving at the hotel the valet who assisted us certainly did not make us aware of the  parking charge nor did the front desk agent who checked us in  I will admit that as a guest we have due diligence to make ourselves aware of that cost but as a former Front Office Manager of another hotel I certainly ensured that my staff would confirm guests had a vehicle parked and that the guest was aware of the charge  Regardless at check in we were handed our goody bag  Five minutes after we arrived to our room the chocolates arrived and five hours later we had to ask about our champagne  Whiskey Sky was overpriced  Wave was great for people watching   though we felt ignored in the afternoon  And then there was the afternoon manager I can only assume   as it was sometimes hard to determine who was an employee and who was not    who was flitting about the lobby smacking her gum certainly not saying hello to her guests  The room itself was very sexy   dark romantic comfortable  Bathroom needed some minor maintanence   one tile on the floor was very loose with broken grout  Wallpaper near the door starting to curl stand for the sink needs to be restained and sealed as it is starting to show some wear  Minor stuff but things that do need to be attended to  No coffee maker in the room so if you care to have the morning cup ojoe and dont want to pay the super high room service charge go down to the lobby   another thing that the front desk agent did not disclose  Bottom line   the stay was nice for us to just get away and celebrate our anniversary   however this probably would not be my first choice  I am indifferent about the experience mostly because of the indifference from the staff  
N => Rundown I have been to the W many times before and each time I was impressed by the cool interior and how sophisticated it was  WAS  It is so rundown peeling wallpaper dirty hallways not to mention how much you could hear the people next door  It was really awful  The lobby VERY loud in the evening and the clientelle has definitely changed from the yuppy  somethings to something else not so great  We wont be back  
N => What a Disaster Booked and prepaid for two nights through hotels com for  per night several days before my arrival  Arrived at pm and was promptly told that the hotel was oversold even though there were several people checking in who received rooms after I arrived they said there were no rooms available in downtown Chicago and they attempted to relocate me to the Westin OHare a night property  I told them that wasnt reasonable for several reasons I had a dinner that night downtown an early meeting the next day etc  Traveling back to OHare then back to the city multiple times was just not fair nor reasonable  I insisted they had an obligation to find me a comparable room in a comparable location  They said sorry there was nothing they could do  After two hours of sitting in the loud lobby I secured a room downtown with my effort and at my expense  The hotel should be embarrassed and ashamed to walk guests who have prepaid for rooms and if they do they should bend over backwards to find alternative accommodations  The W Lakeshore did nothing of the sort  I emailed the GM afterwards who was very apologetic and offered me two free nights at the hotel on another occasion which was generous  I have such a bad taste in my mouth about this place I probably will never attempt to stay there again  With so many terrific hotels in Chicago cant see why anyone would go out of their way to stay here  I did have colleagues at the hotel at the time saw their rooms and they were nothing special  This is an old Holiday Inn dressed up with furnishings from Target  
N => Spectacular  This property is beautiful  We stayed in a Spectacular King Room which meant we had a view of the lake The ONLY thing I did not like about the room was the instead of having a door to the bathroom it was more of a screen  Not as private as a bathroom should be EVERYTHING else about the room was amazing of course W Hotels are all amazingA few amenities of the hotel I have not seen at other W Hotels are the pool and the Spa  Unfortunately the pool was closed for maintenance while we were there  We didnt make it to the spa  The boutique on site is a must for shopping   i did my x mas shopping here  I was able to find plenty of unique gifts  Check out the bar on the rd floor  It has AMAZING views of Chicago  It is a beautiful space full of beautiful people ALSO Check out the Acura booth at thte hotel  Instead of taking a cab you can book an Acura to cruise you around town 
N => Great View so so Hotel We stayed  nights at the W lakeshore in    As big W fans we were really looking forward to staying here  We have stayed at at least a dozen W Hotels but put this one quite low on our list exept for the great view  The Lobby was so busy when we checked in we could not get near the desk  Front desk staff was not in a good mood that day  When I asked if I got my Platinum upgrade she snapped at me and said quotI got ya a good view and thats it we are busy OKquot  Nice start  The room was very small and the shower was so dark I felt I was in a closet with the lights off  Room run down a bit and the worst thing was the ancient air conditioner that sounded like a truck with no muffler  We loved Chicago and used www sneakysunday com to choose our dinners and bars  I have to tell you it was right on My trip would not have been near as good if I did not use sneakysunday  It is a non biast web site that chooses the coolest places to go   And Chicago has come of the coolest So I think next time in Chicago I would pick another Starwood Hotel  The W just didnt live up to W standards  
N => RUDE SERVICE What a nighte This place charges   plus tax for a room the size of a box  I chose this hotel because they boasted they were the only hotel in that area that was on the lake  We got a lake view room  I couldnt believe my eyes   the room was so small and there were  windows that started   feet up the wall  Unless you were right at the window the view was of the clouds  There arent any coffeetea machines in the room so if you want coffee you must go down to the lobby  The bathroom and bedroom and arated by shutters so if you are looking for privacy again this is not for you  We had a family issue on the way to the hotel  When we arrived right after checking in I informed them that we  have to leave the next day because we had a family situation  Later that evening I called down and told them that indeed we would have to go  They said that they would have to charge us  early departure fee  I was mad and went down to talk to someone  Downstairs a manager said that no it was not  but  plus tax for early departure  My husband got the manager and explained that we had to leave due to circumstances beyond our control  She was obnoxious stating their rules and that she could knock it down to   She did not even ask if all was okay but rudely said quotWell what is your emergencyquot There was not one ounce of sympathy for our situation  After he returned to the room I then called down and spoke to the same rude manager and she finally said we owe nothing for our early departure  I am sorry but that is not good service  We will never stay there again  We have been to many W hotels and NEVER have had this experience  
N => Average Hotel Experience We stayed at the W Lakeshore the second weekend in ust for three nights  All in all it was a pleasant  but relatively average  hotel experience Positives Cool or Great Bliss spa products in the room Staff was helpful  when someone cut in front of us in the check in line we complained to the staff and were given free drink coupons The quotWhenever Whateverquot Desk was helpful when we needed to know more about Chicago attractions Comfortable bedsNegatives Not enough elevators  expect a ent wait during peak times Bathroom was small and DARK  very hard to accurately apply makeup in this space Bathroom also had an odd shower configuration  the shower had a wall on one half of the open side with the other side COMPLETELY open  no curtain nothing  so stuff on the floor gets wetAll in all this was nicer than one of those chain hotels with ugly bedspreads and curtains in fact the purple bedspread in our room was one Id love to have at home  But if you are expecting an quotover the topquot experience this falls a little short  The hotel had been part of another less expensive chain before and it shows  The hotel would like to be quotrock starquot but comes across more as quotAmerican Idolquot than true star if that makes sense  
N => Nice place but not nice enough for the money My husband and I stayed at the W for one night and had a good stay  The room view was fair   not of the lakefront though which was disappointing  Although the bathroom setup has taken quite the beating on these reviews my husband and I loved it  It was different from any where else weve ever stayed  Overall the room was nice clean  However there was an adjoining door to another room and you could hear everything  very paper thin walls  We wanted to get room service but the charges were outrageous when we just spent   for one night  Great place for young singles friends romantic getaways but would definetly not recommend it for say my parents or grandparents  The lobby was a bit loud for thier taste but fine for us  
N => Great Place I was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews  The W was very nice we had a great lakeview room with loads to do within walking distance  The WheneverWhatever is a great feature of the hotel  The room had a DVD and there was a list of about  titles to choose from at no charge  This kept our kids busy while my husband amp I were out at night Chicago amp the Navy Pier were a great place to visit for a long weekend  
N => Not what we expected I had to be in Chicago for business so we ided to spend a romantic weekend and explore the city  We have been staying in a W hotel before kind of liked to concept and thought to give it a try in Chicago  Frankly it was a bit of a mistake  The check in was efficient but we did not end up getting the requested room no king size but two small queen size beds     Beside that the room was quite spacious and nicely designed loved the iPod interface The downside was that the place is VERY bad isolated  As we had a room with connecting doors we could here everything  Really bad  This hotel has also a Pet OK policy which is really a problem  On Saturday morning we woke up at  am from a barking dog  I gave a call to the whateverwhenever service and they promised security would do something about it  Well after min the dog was quiet  Unfortunately on Sunday morning we had to go through the same ritual again    When checking out I made a rek on this horrible experience and the answer was quotO I am sorryquot  The lady was totally not interested in the feedback nor ensuring that we would leave with a happy feeling The W chain has been enjoying a too long ride as quotThequot design hotel chain and must ensure to keep the quality up  While we liked the design part of the hotel the total package was ruined by horrible front desk experience the non isolated rooms and a barking dog for  days in a row starting at  am  
N => Awful front desk service The noise level in the lobby due to the thumping music was the first thing that struck me and the customer service was awful The lobby is very loud and compact with the bar and restaurant right there  Hotel is geared to the under  set which I left years ago  They did not honor my request for a king bed when we checked in  The room next to us had an adjoining door with our room and a very young child who cried quite a bit  We requested another room   with a king bed and no adjoining door   that afternoon but we were told they were sold out  The next morning we renewed the request   but they were not accommodating until I told them we would be checking out early  They informed me that we would have to pay for our entire stay because we used Quikbook com but they would try to get us a new room  I called Quikbooks customer service which was excellent  I did not repay and they did not require full payment  Their representative called the hotel and  minutes later we were given a new room The concierge desk was very helpful Overall I will never stay at a quotWquot again  
N => Not what i expected When i first got to the hotel i was happy because i was extremely tired from my flight   While checking in the front desk staff was so warm and helpfull  The room was trendy but not that comfortable  The restaurants managers were petty and fake  I sat at the bar and the bartender would not stop hitting on me  I know the difference between being firendly and inappropriate Uncomfortable Not sure if i would stay there again to be honest  i was stuck there for a weekend and the restuarant had good food but lousy service and the bar     Forget about it 
N => Service Problems I stayed at the W for three nights on business  My room was nice and the location is great  However the service was terrible  I travel quite a bit for business and am trying to stay at Starwood hotels to get points  I like W hotels because they tend to be hipper and offer more amenities that I like  I can almost universally say that the service at W hotels ranges from terrible to mediocre  The service at the W Lakeshore was no different  The doorman got into a fight with the taxi that brought me from the airport and it was downhill from there  They forgot to deliver my breakfast despite the fact that I ordered it which meant I spent the morning in business meetings with nothing to eat  They forgot to give me a wake up call  When confronted about these issues the staff was aloof  I like W hotels but they have got to do something about their service 
N => Lousy Service Typical of W Hotels I stayed at the W hotel and was disappointed right at check in  I booked the room through their own website and listed quotquot as the number of guests  I put in my husbands credit card info with regards to the billing information  I arrived at the hotel before my husband as he was to meet me the next day and thinking ahead I had him give me his credit card in case there were any issues  Unfortunately the lady at the front desk wouldnt let me check because she said his name was listed on the reservation and not mine despite the fact that we share the same last name and are ried and I had his credit card as well as my license  Plus the confirmation email was my email address but she could care less  Luckily I got a hold of him on the phone but often when he is working it could have taken several hours  The fact that did not use common sense was very frusterating especially since I pointed out that their own website only asked for the number of guests not the second guests last name  Secondly the rooms are nice and clean but the safe was broken  We had a great lakeview but the windows are not big so you cant really see the lake from bed  I ordered room service and underlined that I wanted quotsugarquot and of course they forgot despite my underlines  Finally upon checkout I had to ask  times for the final bill yes  times and they couldnt get it for me as all the room charges werent up to date  They said they would email it to me the same day but never got it despite  phone calls later  Upon the fifth phone call I demanded they fax me the whole bill and they gave me push back because I was the wife and not my husband calling  Finally they said they would fax it to me because I was enraged at their incompitence  I finally got the final bill by fax thank goodness  I think they try to hire pretty but stupid people there  
N => Great in Every Way We just returned from a  night weekend stay at the W which was fantastic  I booked the room with Starwood points and as a Platinum member was upgraded to a velous Suite without having to ask  This was the first time in many visits to a Starwood hotel that I didnt have to ask for an upgrade  The room was great and our  year old dhter loved the incredible views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier  The room was clean spacious and had  plasmalcd tvs   each with their own DVD player  The bed was very comfortable and the extra half bath was wonderful  Everyone on the staff was very accomodating  The location was great and we were able to quickly walk to Navy Pier  The museum campus with the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum was only several minutes away  We had a chance to visit the hotel pool which was the perfect temperature and very clean  On Sunday we also enjoyed the complimentary hot tea and dessert in the lobby  Valet parking is  per night but the service was quick and we didnt have any issues  If I had to pay for my next stay while a bit more expensive than other options in the area the W is worth it  
N => Stylish hotel poor service This is a very stylish hotel  The beds were very comfortable and the location was good  It was also a very expensive hotel and along with that there is an expectation of good service  My room was not ready when I arrived although I was a little early  I had to wait over an hour and a half in the lobby  My dhter was also staying in the hotel with her team who had a two day long competition at Navy Pier  Only one of the teams  rooms was ready  That meant  girls their coaches and all their luggage crammed into the one room and one tiny bathroom trying to change into uniforms and get hair and makeup ready for competition on a tight schedule  The teams rooms were not together  My dhter and her teenage teammates were given a smoking room which smelled terrible  We were also not told the parking was an additional   The desk staff valets and bellhops all seemed overwhelmed  We ended up taking our luggage off the cart and wheeling it up to our room ourselves when the room was finally ready because there was a wait to get anyone to wheel the cart and we were not allowed to take it ourselves  Overall it was a pretty disappointing stay  
N => most comfortable room ever Let me say up front that the swanky loud disco lobby was way not for us  Much to much going on there Lobby restaurant was average at the very best  BUT BUT  we got a great rate and our room bed and bathroom were among the very finest that we have ever stayed in  The bed was supercomfortable the bathroom was spa like  In general the room had a feeling of relaxed elegance  We would stay here again despite the disco lobby  housekeeping satff was awesome  
N => Horrible Experience We reserved two rooms  We were given one confirmation number  We cancelled two rooms  We were given one cancellation number  Cancellation was after we viewed photos from previous guests and found the hotel VERY lacking for the price  We cancelled a week in advance  We were then charged two weeks later for  quotno Showquot  We are Starwood Preferred members  When the hotel staff could not seem to issue the credit I called the Preferred Club and was assured that they had spoken to the hotel and all was taken care of and they even gave me the name of the manager in accounting they spoke to  Two days later no credit yet  I called this hotel accounting manager He claims he never spoke to anyone and even claimed he never got the  minute message I left him two days prior on his voicemail  After three hours and arguing over these past two days they finally said they would fax confirmation of the credit  I am still waiting  I am appalled that the Starwood Club would outright lie to a member just to get us off the phone  I will never stay at their hotels again  The manager claimed he could not find our reservation because I used my first name instead of my husbands  We have a VERY unique last name  Kinda hard to not find  I have never been so frustrated with a cast of people  
N => Not worth it unless youre there for a party atmosphere I stayed here with a friend to enjoy a night in Chicago before I flew out of Ohare  I honestly would not recommend this hotel  For what we paid its just not worth it UNLESS you are in Chicago have some money to blow and want to feel like a hot shot and party  When we arrived later on a Friday night it felt like we were entering a techno club  We couldnt even figure out where to check in  Dont get me wrong the design is cool and thats why we booked it  But the room was small and lacked a good view  I will confirm what other reviews say about the strange bathroom  The lighting sucks for girls trying to do makeup   Ive never seen such bad lighting   and I have never complained about the lighting in a bathroom but somehow it was just really bad There was a weird shuttered window in the bathroom which you could open from either side   be nice for couples definately not for anyone else sharing a room together  There was no fan in the bathroom either   a bit uncomfortable  The water in the shower overflowed several times into the rest of the bathroom also  Had to keep stopping the water and soaking it up     and alas we couldnt watch tv without having to pay  As far as location it is a quick cab ride to Michigan avenue but not a walk you would want to do in the cold  Honestly this place isnt all its cracked up to be  I wouldnt stay here again  
N => Over Rated W Hotel I recently stayed here   with friends amp found the hotel nice but highly over rated  The hotels homepage spg com rates this as a Category  hotel amp other websites rate it as      I found this hotel to be no more than     at best  It used to be a Days Inn amp that shows through out the complex with broken everything in the rooms including mirrors hanging with  screw airconditioning constantly breaking amp loud door handles fridge all required repair we had  adjoining rooms amp neither room was quotmaintenance freequot The windows are old amp many were broken   some even missing glass I have a real issue too when the hotel advertizes amp promotes free coffee amp danishbagels in the morning which being an early riser amp a smoker was welcome while I read the paper outside on a cute little terrace off the lobby but when I came for a refill was charged   for a coffee Turns out quotfree coffeequot is only until  amThe restaurant in the lobby has excellent food though it is loud being right in the lobby with no walls erating it One thing that peeved us was the advertizing of the hotels bar which upon arrival was found extrordinarily lacking amp appeared to be built as an after thought without any effort in orating  Also they dont have a food licence  so its all drinking without even a peanut let alone being able to order appetizers for that matter we couldnt even have room service bring us something  The hotels brochure could use a radical editingOn the PLUS side however the concierge was wonderful amp was able to get my  girlfriends into the Oprah Show on standby tickets which really made their trip Also the beds were extremely comfortable amp the Bliss Spa on premises was lovely with a wonderful staff The view of the lake was beautiful but with such a wonderful location you would think this quothigh end chainquot would have spent a little more on or amp quality  
N => Never again We booked a quotvelous suitequot with the business plan printer and fax in the room due to requirement to work while this hotel Check in was abominable reception desk is adjacent to the WAVE bar needed to shout all communication  At  PM on a Saturday the lobby was packed with people spilling over from the bar All hallways are very dark the suite had seen better days much of the furniture was nicked and scratched the CD player did not work no one at reception and concierge desks knew how to use the Sirius radio no printer or fax the bathroom was FILTHY   months of scum around the outside of the glass shower enclosure the plastic flange on the bottom of the glass shower door was dark brown with scum After unpacking I started to flip through the quotcoffee table bookquot    a single edged razor blade was inside the cover along with its brown cover arated and a little white dust  TWO requests in person at the reception desk to have it removed were ignored  We left the book open all day Sunday housekeeping did nothing Monday room service took breakfast tray but ignored to razor no housekeeping service that day either I called the manager on Tuesday morning  She apologized and sent a clerk up     razor was removed that day day   FOUR of the stay bathroom was cleaned  Printer and fax engineer left a message that the hotel would purchase and install the printer and fax BUT I WOULD NEED TO PAY FOR THE PRINTER AND FAX UNIT  I explained to the manager that the confirmation email from the hotel FIVE DAYS before my arrival mentioned the printer and fax as we paid for the business plan   she said that the email was a quotglitchquot and the hotel no longer offered the plan for which I had paidConcierge suggested that I use the wifi in the hotel and quotrelaxquot as I did business or use the business center All in all a very disappointing stay especially since this suite cost    per night  At this rate no one should have to ask to have the bathroom cleaned of scum repeatedly ask for drug paraphenalia to be removed etc  The furniture was in poor shape reading in the rooms was very difficult as the lamps are of unusual design  On the good side the bed was extremely comfortable wide screen TV in living area worked fine but the bedroom TV could not recieve many station signals  Bedroom curtain quotblack out type could not be rolled up two days in a row    made for a dark environment in which to try to work Room service and restaurant food was very good no coffee makers in the rooms however concierge stated that quotour guests do not mind paying for room service coffeequot  I needed a Chicago telephone directory none are placed in the rooms as concierge again quotour guests do not seem to use themquot    they sent up a local directory of the area around the hotel   not helpful for my business needs We will never stay here again nor at another W hotel  The attitude of the staff was very condescending as well as abrupt Starwood hotels should review this property very closely  I have NEVER complained at or after ANY hotel stay in more than  years I consider the stay at this hotel well below acceptable  
N => Wonderful Experience We Stayed at the W for  nights  Pretty neat hotel  Yes the walls were a little thin but we were there St Pattys night amp slept greatBeds were very comfortable Pool was average  Very Hip alot of  somethings having a good time  We had our  Boys with us  amp They thought it was verycool The Bellman even gave them some waterbottlesgames amp a yoyo on check out  I parked at Millenium garage on advice from the forum here to save on the  night valet  The going rate is about  we paid only  because of Hotwire so it in my opinion was terrific value  My advice If you can get a great rate it is more than worth it We found Chicago to be very friendly to tourists  It really is a great city with GREAT People 
N => Obvious this hotel used to be a Holiday Inn This was my first time staying at a W Hotel and I certainly hope the Lakeshore is not indicative of all W Hotels  When we arrived to check in at night we had to yell to be heard over the people partying in the lobby  I know W is a quothipquot chain but putting the check in area in a quieter spot would not be too much to ask  The rooms were nice but not soundproof at all  We awoke one morning to very amorous sounds from our neighbors and we also heard everyone coming home late at night as they traipsed through the hallway The or was pleasing but nothing special  I expected more for  a night and my room had no view at all  Its obvious from the layout and ugly exterior that this used to be a Holiday Inn  The bathroom was small and had a window opening between it and the main room  The opening closed with shutters i e  no soundproofing at all  I love my SO very much but there are times when privacy is nice On the plus side the staff was very helpful and friendly the rooms lobby and hall were very clean and the mojitos in the bar were excellent The location was ideal for a weekend in Chicago close to the lake Michigan Ave etc With all the hotels that Chicago has to offer though I would not stay here again unless the price were less than  a night  
N => out of  hotels is about Right W lakeshore is very very average hotel th is about ranking i would give too  All other reviews are about on   Negatives   Most W Hotels are hipcool this one is loud    very loud   Registration deskconceirge desk are in middle of disco so impossible for kids and they are kids to hearWe had horrible staff experiences to very good ones with front desk mgr daniel security guard damionand evening doorman  room service waiters were excellent   Negatives  There are alot    besides noise in hallways guestroomsno quiet place anywhere   Housekeeping comes into room regardless of signs to do otherwise very intrusive We had to have  keys YES TEN KEYS made before we were able to get them to change locks   one desk clerk told us it was obviously our fault   even though their security staff twice had to let us into our room and couldnt get us in with keys provided     finally i took front desk mgr to room and after he couldnt get it to work   lock was changed   Would i stay there again NO    rooms are in need rehab but told they are doing it    but just not good enough for   we paid   Extra charges above bill were substantial City bed taxes   so expect   tax  NOT their fault but when added to     for internet most chains now freemovies   instead    phone call cost us   and   bottle water      for drycleaning suit You are paying  star hotel prices for Hip Days Inn quality room experience  Im in hotel business own hotels and recognize stuff happens nanywhere   How you correct it is what matters   W stands for WAcky    there are probably  better hotels in chicago    go somewhere else  Location might be good in summer but winter not good choice either    
N => Poor service poor quality poor experience overall From the outset the W Chicago Lakeshore was lacking the appeal that Starwoods W Hotels have everywhere else  The staff is incredibly curt  They make it visibly obvious that any request you  have    be it as simple as a wake up call    is an inconvenience for them The communication between the hotels front end and its other staff is poor as well  I asked not to be disturbed when I checked in as I had just gotten in from a long flight and wanted to nap a little bit  To my surprise and disgust a housekeeper walked right into my room without so much as a knock at the door  She claimed not to have been told that there was a guest in the room  The hotel insisted on buying me dinner at their restaurant    Wave    that evening which was WONDERFUL actually The design of the hotel is poor  As another reviewer mentions this was formerly a Days Inn or some other such lesser quality hotel  As such the infrastructure is thin and in need of repair  Entire conversations can be heard from adjacent rooms  The management is all too concerned with themselves to be of any assistance to the guests in this regard  In fact when I mentioned it to them the manager said quotWell you got an adjustment yesterday what more do you want from usquot I was appalled to have been spoken to in that way  I wanted my reservation to have been carried out just as it was planned I was looking for nothing special at all  It was audacious and overly obnoxious for the manager to have behaved that way  quotWhateverWheneverquot at this hotel is more like quotNothingNever quotAfter three nights of the same types of experiences plumbing not working correctly housekeepers ignoring the quotdo not disturbquot sign on the door entering the room when the guests are present noise from adjacent rooms and the audacity of the management we relocated to the W Chicago City Centre  Our experience there was highly enjoyable and made up for all of the inconveniences at Lakeshore  When we return well head straight to the City Centre hotel or to the Intercontinental on Michigan Ave  which seemed incredible Last thing to mention is the oration of the room I was not expecting to have a window    with shudders    leading from the bathroom into the main part of the room  It was an awkward design to say the least  
N => disappointed My dhter made reservation through hotwire so not sure of the exact total but was around  I would have been very very upset if we had paid their usual room charge  Reading the reviews I was sure that the hotel would be great a little different but good  This used to be a days inn and that is what it looked like a cheaper hotel that they had tried to make look elegant and hip but failed  The good was their bar didnt go there but it did look inviting with a view  Location was very good if you wanted to go to Navy Pier Indoor pool on the small side no hot tub  Comfortable beds plazma tv  The bad Small rooms city view of roof tops black ceilings in rooms drab colorsnot even enclosed closet just a rod such as you would find in Days inn  Bathroomnot enough water pressure not enough hot water color was grey with one wall red not enough lighting a pocket door that did save some space but then they added a wood shuttered window opening from bathroom to bed area that you could open from both sides some might think that is trendy but I did not  The hallways were on the dark side with small rocks placed on both sides the entire length of the hall  very different I havent saw that done in any other hotel  But I doubt if anyone would say they wanted to stay here because they had rocks in the hallway  I get really ticked off about bottled water in the rooms I feel that if hotels place water in the room it should be complimentary the W charges  for a small bottle and  for the larger version  I was hesitant to make the coffee in the room not sure if they were going to charge a fee for that also  Coffee in the morning downstairs was over  that is not a good thing  We have stayed at numerous hotels in Chicago for the money this one was very disappointing  There are lots of better looking hotels in this city with more services offered for the money  I would have to say I wont be staying here a second time  
N => Fantastic Hotel I have to admit that after reading the reviews I was slightly hesitant about staying at The W Lakeshore  But it lived up to the hype that usually surrounds W hotels   it was awesome  The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating  They helped us with cabs and suggested which places to visit over others  When it came to go out at night the bartenders made some wise suggestions  When we got back at around  AM it wasnt that crazy like some people have suggested in earlier reviews  Yes there were people in the lobby but it did not prevent us from making it up to the room  The rooms were beautiful   save the black ceilings   which does indeed make it difficult to apply your make up  They supply make up mirrors so you can see up close  The Bliss products were incredible  My friend actually bought the travel kit they sell in the gift shop Love the facial scrub  The beds were comfy and were so cozy to get in after a night out on the town  Overall it was a great experience and when I go back to Chicago I definitely intend on staying there again  
N => Better than expected Just returned from a two night stay at the W and based on the previous reviews we werent sure what to expect  We can say that we were pleasantly surprised  There was no check in line and the bellmen were courteous and prompt  Our room was small but tastefully orated and very clean  Would have preferred a queen or king bed but none were available  There was plenty of lighting in the room and bathroom as needed and my wife and I both felt the bathroom privacy was more than adequate  Perhaps we were fortunate but upon turning in for the night we heard no noise at all other than the somewhat noisy but not terrible air conditioner We did feel somewhat quotoldquot at the hotel we are both  but it is only intimidating if you let it get that way  Thought the see thru walls in the public quotw cquot at the Wave was a scream  This is the only W we have ever stayed in so we cant offer a comparison to others but if youre looking for a different hotelexperience the W is the place  We would definately stay here again as well as give other Ws a try  
N => Paper thin walls Every W Hotel is cool  Although there were a couple things that made this particular stay just average  The front desk guy was somewhat useless  I blame it on hiring young people who dont have an ingrained sense of sophistication  Im used to more professional individuals  The room was cute except the walls were paper thin  Thats my biggest complaint  I could hear a phone ringing   at first I thought it was the one in my room  Then on the other side of my room I could hear a couple talking just regulary  That made me nervous since its not like they were speaking loudly  I was promptly moved to another room after my request  I probably wont stay there again  Come to find out the next day from my clients that this hotel was an old Holiday Inn It all makes sense now  
N => Only for  and under We were so disappointed in our visit and will not return to any W hotels  This is NOT value at all There was NO TURNDOWN SERVICENO SHOWER CAPS IN THE ROOMNO INFORMATION ABOUT THE CITY IN THE ROOMTINY BATHROOMcaraffes of coffee in the lobby each morning but it turns out each cup paper cup was  No bar to have a drink  unless you dont mind waiting over  minutes when its empty and dont mind the LOUD LOUD MUSIC  IN OTHER WORDS FORGET CONVERSATIONThe place is such a scene there was a line wbouncers just to enter the hotel at night  we had to fight through the line and could only enter once we showed our room card  Expect to fight to get an elevator too I guess if you want a quotscenequot this is the place  
N => Better Than I Expected for Kids We booked our hotel on Hotwire and as a result had no idea where we were staying until we finalized our reservations  We were travelling with our two boys ages  and  and I was a little nervous about our stay after reading several of the reviews  Namely that the hotel was high on attitude and not a good place for kids Overall we were very pleased with our visit  Not only did we NOT encounter attitude from the staff when we walked in with our kids in tow they could not have been more accomodating  Everyone on staff without exception was as friendly and helpful as I have ever encountered in a hotel  We enjoyed the hotels proximity to Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile both about a   minute walk The or in the lobby was very modern and appealing and always hopping with lots of people hanging out and enjoying a cocktail  I would have enjoyed the lobby quotscenequot more without the kids  I found our room however to be dark and showing wear and not as appealing as the lobby  The pool was very nice and I was relieved to find other kids playing in it as kids do  No shushing or dirty looks from other patrons as one might expect in a hotel with quotattitudequot Probably would not be my first choice for a family vacation as it is truly geared towards adults  But if you happen to get a great rate as we did dont shy away just because youll have the kids with you  You wont be alone  
N => Nice but soulless This was my first time staying at a W and it was adequate but not rekable  The or is fashionable and modern but also bland and unimaginative  The service was great for the most part except for Saturday night when a doorman demanded to see our IDs or hotel keys before letting us enter  This seemed like a consequence of the Ws burdensome and contrived hipness  On the practical side the walls were too thin and and air conditioning unit was very noisy  But the beds were very comfortable room service food was delicious and the Bliss bath products were a nice surprise  And the location was wonderful Its not hard to stay at the W but I will try the Hotel Burnham on my next trip to Chicago  Its in the same price range and seems to have more character without being so desperately cool  
N => Worst Hotel I Have Ever Been In Terrible Hotel Loud Dirty Rude employees waited and hour to have our luggage sent up then after finally calling to find out where it was it came another half hour later No phone books in the rooms which really stinks if you need to find a local number  Called to have one sent up never cameWe went down to borrow one and it took  people at the front desk to come up with one Could not wait to get out of this place it was awful  It was just an unorganized mess  Walls are paper thin chairs in bar are plastic  Extrememly loud music is playing   Definitely not for the  something crowd  be the  somethings if they dont care about where they are staying want to pay   for a drink and sit on plastic chairs  There was not rhyme or reason to this place it was just a mess We had an awful stay  Very dissapointed  
N => really cool vibe at this hotel This place is very nice  The staff all the way from the valet attendant to the front desk to the bellhop to the room service attendant   top notch helpful and friendly The room was a bit small for my taste and the bathroom had limited privacy  My room had this pacific island theme and there was a window with shutters that arated the living area from the bathroom   weird But it was kinda cool  The quotheavenlyquot beds were very comfy and the view was great looking out across Lake Michigan  Id have to say the only downside to this hotel is the fact that they were in the middle of reations during my stay and we had to quotpardon the dustquot    I understood  Hey they have to upgrade at some point right And the weirdest thing would have to be when we came back at about  AM after the wedding we attended was over we pulled up and to find the lobby has been transformed into a nightclub  I thought this was very interesting except for the fact that there was about  people laying down outside and they were clearly inebriated and ready to puke  I mentioned to my brother that if we were just arriving for the first time right then I wouldve been very turned off that such a high class hotel turns into a pukefest nightclub  Dont get me wrong I think the whole nightclub thing in the lobby was cool   just not the puking guests laying all over the place outside the front entrance  All in all this is a fantastic place to stay in a tremendous location just  blocks from the magnificent mile 
N => Not quite wowing I booked a room at the W Chicago Lake shore for a girls Friday night out on the town  Since I work for another Starwood property I get a hefty discount on rooms and the price was definetly a steal  We used the valet parking which was  a night with unlimited  hour re entry  A little pricey but better that trying to find a parking spot  Upon arrival the check in was swift and easy and the staff was polite  The gal who checked us in put us on the th floor so that we would have a nice view of the city and was it ever We had a great view of the John Hancock Building  The room was clean there were two double Heavenly beds that were awesome as always and a plasma TV to enjoy  The Bliss toiletries were amazing but the bathroom was a bit strange  The door consisted of a wicker moving panel that slid over the entry way opening  There was also a cutout in the wall with wooden shutters that closed to cover it  The bathroom was nicely orated but all in all not a lot of privacy The conceriege was knowledgeable about the city and was very helpful  He provided maps of the city and showed us where to go  After a late night out we ordered room service which is open  hours which was good but a bit pricey  We ordered the Sirloin Cheeseburger  and the Chicken Wings   The delivery gentleman was prompt and courteous We asked for an extended check out so that we could do some shopping and it was granted for  pm  The staff was polite at check out and the bill was correct All in all it was a good stay but I have two things to complain about  I purposely booked this hotel because it had an indoor pool  Upon check in the gal told me the pool was on the th floor and that I should check it out  When we went to go for a swim we found out the pool was closed for maintenance  That was very dissapointing as it was not noted anywhere on their website  I would have booked elsewhere like the Sheraton Towers if I had known this  The second thing is that after heading off to bed at  am bars are open until  we were awoken at  by a banging on the wall  When I called down to the front desk I was told they would check into it   minutes later I heard it again and called the desk  I was then told that they were laying carpet in the room above us  I asked if they had to do it at  in the morning and they said that they were under contract and had to do it then  This was unacceptable  They knew that they would be laying carpet so why were put on the floor directly below I was offered no apology or compensation  I hate to believe that they treat their guests so poorly and hope this was a one time bad experience especially for the money most people pay to stay at the W Lake shore Like I said it was a good experience but with other Starwood properties to stay at in Chicago these oversights and lack of being able to deliver a wowing experience have made me think about staying elsewhere next time  
N => NOISY Aside from the ubiquitous modern W vibe the hotel has little to offer  We book a package through the W website that was to come with welcome amenities  Two hours after our arrival nothing had come  We had to call the front desk multiple times to even get a confirmation that this was included in our package  The wine and apps finally showed about  minutes before we were to leave for dinner  Bad serviceAlso our first room was adjacent to some partiers this was clear immediately  We request a change which was granted no problem only to realize this hotel has NO sound proofing  We could hear our neighbors entire conversation Too LoudUnless you cant live with out the Ws chic styling pass this one up 
N => NEEDS REATION Not a place for a romantic weekend  Hotel geared for singles like a dorm atmosphere  Noisy cold and dirty  Water in bathroom was warm not hot Bathrobe was stained and old  
N => Not up to W standards In tember  I stayed at the W Lakeshore in Chicago  There were several things that I found completely unsatisfactory especially for a W Hotel  We stayed in Room number  from t      The window shades were tattered and torn right side   The bathroom wallpaper was peeling   The soap holder in the shower was broken Non Room Specific Related Items   No one not once opened the front door for us    There was no turn down service either night   While in the lobby we asked the WhateverWhenever attendant how we arranged a wake up call and instead of taking care of himself he curtly replied quotoh you can just call  and ask for WhateverWhenever and they will arrange itquot isnt he quotwhateverwhenever  As an SPG Gold Preferred we were given quotupgraded roomquot the room was shabby and the view was terrible and overlooked a parking lot not the lake  Not what I consider and upgrade    The service and appetizer food at the living room bar was awful and slow   When we left on Friday morning at am there was no one outside or anywhere to be seen to assist us with getting a cab to the airport  I stay at the W in San Diego quite often  This W should take a lesson in staff training from them where I consistently find the service to be outstanding  There was nothing quotwarm or wonderfulquot about the hotel nor was there quotexceptional service and staffquot that the W hotel promotes  It was quite the contrary and I was thoroughly disappointed  I will not stay at this hotel again nor will I recommend it to my business associates  I was there on business meeting with two of my top clients and I was unimpressed as were they  
N => Nothing impressive but ok I recently stayed for about  week for my first time in W Chicago Lakeshore Well after reading all the latest reviews gotta admit that after all my experience was not so bad Two years ago I ve stayed in the other W Hotel the City Center and I was really impressed with the service and stuff  So this year I ided to book the Lakeshore because it was nearer to North Michingan Avenue just about   minutes by walk and to experience this hotel The room was located on the th floor and unfortunately with NO lake view I could see just a part of the John Hancock Center  I was placed into a double room instead of a singular but at least the room was big and clean The room service was not always impectable sometimes the orange juice or toast was missing   but the quality of the food was good but not excellent considerating the expensive prices  The hotel staff was anyway friendly and helpful they took great care of you if you give nice tips   I appreciated the express check out My experience was nothing impressive but it was ok  If I will have a chance to be back in Chicago I m not sure I will stay in W Lakeshore  
N => A disappointment   Would not return Just returned from a  day weekend get away at the W Lakeshore Chicago   and was thoroughly disapointed with our Whatever Whenever experience The music was so loud in the lobby I could not hear the front desk staff and had to shout during check in  Not a great first impression If you a are a light sleeper this hotel is not for you  Rooms are very loud amp noisy   traffic sounds from the street below can be clearly heard on the th floor  Walls amp doors are very thin   noise from the neighboring rooms amp corridor woke us up more than once Furnishings are showing wear amp tear   rooms looking rather tired beat up and uncared for  The shower was useless   very weak water pressure no tub either Next time Id stay at the Sofitel Water Tower or Hyatt  
N => nice but missing the finish I like most quotWquots but rarely are they up to the standard of their older sisters the Westin When we checked in they had electrical outages at the front desk the staff was squinting to read reservation and credit card  s using small candles not sure what would have been wrong with a flashlight other than it wouldnt have matched the or  When my colleague checked in they asked to see his picture ID and then told him it was too dark to read  N C drivers license  and did he have anything elseThe room was nice and cosy but the coffee maker didnt work and the plug in the bathtub was non functional Ive stayed in  Ws in the last  months they work hard on their style but consistently seem to stumble on the delivery 
N => Nice view  but bad hotel We stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary but the hotel is really for singles only  I would not bring kids  The hotel staff were o k  nothing impressive not very friendly  The hallways to the rooms were smelly and dirty  We stayed on the st floor the view was amazing and the bed was very comfortable  Our door to the room was all banged up and scratched  The hotel bouncers were everywhere at night because the hotel lobby turns into a club at night  Bottom line You cant get the Days Inn out of the W Chicago Lakeshore  
N => Work in progress Ive read a lot of reviews on here and I was a little nervous  First the Air conditioners are ok  They informed me that by next summer they will have all new ones  Which didnt help with this stay  It seems like there a work inprogress  There building a Bliss spa which I hear are newyorks it spot right now  Theyve remodeled there gym and its fantastic  Checkin was quick and smooth  I had booked a city view room with two beds  I was upgraded to a lake view  I still cant get over how nice every one was  I think with any hotel you are going to have small problems  Like in room dining was cold  I voiced my complaint and it was comp  I think if you give them a chance to recover they will exceed your expectations  I already booked my next stay I have to see how consistant they can be If any one staying there needs anything Daniel is the man to call  He took great care of me and my wife 
N => sexy hotel I highly enjoyed my stay at this hotel on a Saturday night  Though the hotel was full and the elevators were slow everyone was so nice and friendly  Having read the reviews here I knew what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised how nice the room was not run down at all  First thing I did was start playing the CD they provided and mixing cocktails  Then off to the pool which is just OK but I do like the chaise lounges nearly fell asleep in them  Then back to the room to use that awesome shower while looking out on the lake  Dressed and went to Whiskey Sky for cocktails woops it was closed for a private party  Only disappointment of my stay  Went to Navy Pier for dinner at Rivas which was excellent then to the Shakespeare Theater for Second Cities Romeo and iet  What a hoot Back to the hotel to watch the fireworks from our room  See photo  Great bed  Good breakfast at Wave  Quick valet  
N => Eccletic Night Club Feel The W is now one of my favorite hotels to stay at  As soon as you pull up there are bellman which all look like bouncers with ear pieces there to greet you  When you walk inside it is a very upscale trendy night club feel  Half of our group were able to get into the room before check in time which was great  The hall ways to the rooms even have stones on the side  The rooms were beautiful and very trendy a little small but who cares we were in Chicago  The view I would have to say was the worse of the whole trip  We were on the th floor and we staring out onto the side of another building not attractive  Breakfast was a little expensive but had fresh squeezed OJ it was a delight  I would highly reccommend anyone to stay there  It is also just a few blocks away from Michigan avenue and Navy Pier  
N => Good but not great Having stayed at a quotWquot hotel before my expectations were high  Once in our superior lake view room we realized we had a city building view room Upon speaking to the manager who was not exactly sympathetic to our situation we ided to keep the room but at the lesser rate  We also had booked a pet friendly room  We didnt receive any amenities until we asked  Twice  Although it was a nice enough hotel we were monumentally spoiled at another W hotel last year so perhaps we expected too much  
N => W Lakeshore was great We stayed at the W Lakeshore this last weekend  The room was beautiful  We had a lake view which was truly a terrific site  Everyone at the W was extremely attentive and willing to help us in anyway they could  My next visit to Chicago I will definitely be staying at the W  
N => Funky yet accessible We went to visit some friends and brought my  year old They were very kind to us and the pool was great  Right across the street we had the ferris wheel and lots of fun activities  The stores and restaurants were close by as well  We thought it was perfect experience  
N => W wanna be important but get used to hearing no stayed w my family on valantines weekend Room was cramped and very dusty   all  of us had problems from the dust when we woke up the next morning Only one restaraunt   only serving a  course meal   ONLY    they told us to take our kid  amp  to the BAR for dinnerWho are they kiddingCalled room service   asked for a hamburger   they said quotcant do thatquot asked for MacCheese for kids   they said quotcant do that eitherquotwe ordered a steak to split and a chicken ceasar salad   gt it cost     no drinks we ordered either What a RIP food was fair    for that price it should have been outstanding for the level of hotel and cost they should have bent over backwards Went to breakfast the next morning w continental free breakfast coupons   we have to make sure our son has protein and special food due to food allergies  They told us we couldnt apply a dollar value to the coupon to get him a different meal    we just continually heard quotNOquot to everything Strangely the following night we went to the Ritz Carlton for dinner   and they bent over backwards for us   taking our coats showing to the restrooms table etc extremely polite clean beautiful place   worth the money    but NOT at the W LakesideHuge disappointmentThey even wanted US to call HQ to make sure my husbands unused hotel points were redeposited into his account after we ided to switch hotels  They made NO attempt to make things right or do what any other hotel would do  
N => Watch out your credit card statement EXTRA EXTRA chrages show up I took my staff to a conference in Chicago and we stayed at W Hotel from  to   We had  rooms all together  During check out our bill showed up additional   for telephone which we did not use  Everyone has cell phones and who would use hotel phone to call home After verifying it with all my staff we contacted the front desk and they removed it  When I received my credit card bill Yes they did remove the   charge but a   charge showed up on my credit card bill I contacted W Hotel Lakeshore Chicago billing department to ask them what happened they never return my calls  I contacted Citibank and I am disputing the charges  I stay with Starwood hotels all the time when we travel and I even own a timeshare with Starwood  This is by far the worst experience I had with any starwood hotels  I would avoid W Hotel Chicago 
N => Great hotel and staff My family and I just got back from this hotel and I did not want to leave I have stayed at many other quotWquot but I have to say that the staff here was wonderful  From the moment that I arrived it was geat  Dainel check us in early and even offered a free upgrade  He gave us a nice lakeview room awsome view for free  The bellman Dave Thompson was also very nice  He call us by name and when we went to get a cab he offered us a complentary ride to our destination in a  Chrysler water and snaks provide When it was time to leave they also give us a late check out with out any problems  I travel a lot and this by far was the best hotel staff Ive ever delt with  And last but not least that the rooms are very nice too  
N => The worst in the W chain not worth the price I had been warned that this used to be a Days Inn by the locals in Chicago but I didnt listen because it does have an incomparable view of the lake  But for nearly  a night this location has failed miserably in not reating the rooms from the hotels earlier incarnations  They have basically taken your standard rectangular no frills low end hotel chain box and thrown in some fancy linens and a little shuttered window in the bathroom wall  Then they threw a hip bar in the lobby and a big glittery quotWquot out on the curb and voila now the rooms are  a night  Puhleease 
N => Can you say DAYS INN Its still a Days Inn with paper thin walls and noisy elevator  Stay away Stay far far away from this so called hip hotel   be great for juvenile college type  I dont understand all the hype of this hotel  Its not worth the money  I found a MUCH nicer hotel in the area at about  the price but Im keeping that secret to myself 
N => Absolutely wrong for families I have to absolutely agree with the reviews that say this is not a hotel for families  Even though my  year old loved it it was sort of quotcreepy quot The black pseudo asian or is pretentious  There are no vending machines in the entire place  If you want a pop you have to go to the bar or order room service  We wanted to spend a weekend downtown without having to go back on the train each night  Next time we go it would be better to stay right on N  Michigan Ave Part of our package was to have a quotspectacularquot lake view  They put us on the eighth floor and all we could see was the building  We had to schlepp down to the lobby and change rooms  Of course no other rooms were available at that time I guess this would be a fine hotel for quothipster doofusesquot If you are a regular person or have a family avoid it  
N => Great Hotel but avoid the rooms by the elevator  I came here to celebrate my dhters th birthday  She was dying to stay at a W The hotel was great except   we were located in the room right next to the elevators and all night long it sounded like there were airplanes flying close overhead  There was also a sorority party going on at the hotel and so we were awoken at midnight and again at  am by the young party goers  Needless to say rooms seem to lack a good sound proofing system  or was sleek and trendy and service was good  I wondered if I was given the not so prime room because I was there with  twelve year olds rather than a sophisticated partner Who knows be Im just being paranoid I would stay here again but request a room very far from the elevator shaft  
N => Very cool hotel Just came back from a  night stay at the W Hotel Lakeshore  What a classy place but hip enough that I didnt feel out of place being  years old  The lobby has really neat chairs and quite a bar scene in the evenings  The room was nicely appointed lots of pillows and a neat couch  They were very accomodating to changing all the linens from down to synthetic  We were able to go to our room immediately even though it was only  am of course it was a Thursday so this could have been an anomaly  My only beef was that the concierge service was a little too into themselves they didnt seem all that interested in helping us find a place to eat for a special night  I dont expect a lot from staff but I felt that were bothering the concierge taking him away from his personal phone call  All in all I would so recommend a stay there  Very nice hotel  
N => too much  too less Well i checked in  and to my suprise the rooms were too small  I thought it was gonna be bigger  They stated online that i could get a rollaway bed or the room came with a chiase lounge but they lied  I had a double room occupancy with  people sharing it the sink was stopped up when we arrived and I honestly believe that the comforter werent changed daily  I had a  night stay there and wont be back  the charge was reg   a night luckily I used my govt  discount wich made the room  a night  I still wont be back 
N => Cold showers only Recently had a very unpleasant three night stay at the W  On the first morning we noticed that we had no hot water in the shower or sink and almost no water pressure  After a cold shower and shave I complained to front desk who apologized and promised to have the problem corrected  The next morning the water was still as freezing as the day before  This time I spoke to both a supervisor and manager both of whom apologized and again assured me that the problem would be fixed  Needless to say the water was again cold the next morning  When I asked for a refund the Hotel informed me that this was not possible because I had prepaid for my stay   I was given enough quotpreferred guestquot points for a free nights stay but I still believe that I should not have to pay over  a night for a hotel that cannot even provide hot water  
N => Stay some where eles  
N => Not for ChildrenFamilies  
N => Simply   wild  not your regular Holiday Inn  
N => nice rooms comfortable beds We stayed at the Swissotel on   nd It was extremely busy when we got there and yet check in moved along quickly  Front desk was very pleasant  It was a bitter cold day and they had mulled cider in the loby which we thought was a nice touch  Our room was clean and spacious  TV remote didnt work so we called the front desk and they had one up to us within   minutes  We had a great night sleep because the bed was so comfortable  We spent just one night but all in all it was a great stay  Would recommend it and would definitely stay again  
N => Loved the Swissotel We just returned from a trip to Chicago and after staying in the Swissotel have nothing but the best things to say about this hotel We arrived at about  am and were told that the room wouldnt be available until about  pm which you could expect  The bell staff was happy to hold my bags till I returned  Returning to the hotel about  pm I was then able to check into my room  To my surprise I had a great king bed room looking over Lake Michigan the Chicago river and Navy pier  It was a million dollar view  We found everything in the room to be fine  Then headed to the th floor to use the pool amp whirlpool  Once again the view was to die for  The pool and whirlpool were a great way to relax after spending the day shopping  Didnt use the workout area but looked like they had plenty of equipment for guest to use After checking out on Sunday we checked our bags so we could do some more walking and shopping  Returning about  pm and found the fireplace located off the lobby a great place to warm up and relax having a cocktail  All I can say is that I found nothing but good things about this hotel and their employees  I will be staying here on my next trip back to chicago 
N => Dull and outdated This Swissotel feels dated and although there was no major problem during our stay we didnt leave the hotel feeling satisfied  The property was under the standards we would expect from a property at this price level  Beds should be more comfortable and the room and hotel in general were rather dull and feel more like a  than a  star hotel  Front desk staff was not pleasant at all and did not bother to satisfy our room preferences  Next time in Chicago I would skip the Swissotel and stay elsewhere  
N => OK but bid low Won this Swissotel priceline for  Stayed last night in order to be downtown for the thanksgiving parade  Hotel is VERY hard to find  it is at the END of upper wacker  and if youre not familiar with upperlower wacker you can get very mixed up we spent  minutes just driving around all the wackers  I did not want to spend the  for hotel valet parking since the public parking next door was  but after  minutes of driving around I just wanted to be at the hotel So I paid the big bucks to drop the car at the door  My initial impressions were positive  Very classy entrance nice staff  Very kid friendly have a little desk with crayons and coloring books while you check in and give you a kids pack with things for the kids to do Pool is nice whirlpool very nice  BUT    there were definitely some low class trashy people in the hotel who felt they deserved the entire pool to themselves doing cannonballs etc Room was nice but more like   Hyatt than a    Beds very small  luckily we brought our inflatable bed  Bathroom was nice arate shower and bathtub lots of toiletries  But the hairdryer was hanging in the closet didnt find it till my hair was dry  They also short you on pillows   per bed instead of the usual  per bed Location is not great  a good walk from any sights  And there is not direct route to anything  you have to walk up down to this side and that side  And with priceline we got the cheap view not the navy pier view even though the hotel was pretty empty Valet service is a joke  takes forever to get the car and then they stand right next to you until you tip them  I understand they work hard and all  but for  I should have the right not to tip someone for just driving my car up to the door Anyway I would not be terribly disappointed if I won it again but next time I would bid lower  
N => Great experience One of the most pleasant stays I have had in Chicago  From checking to checking out I loved the room and the staff  The view we had from our room of Navy Pier was outstanding  
N => Dont let the fancy European name fool you     Believe me It was just OK  Great fancy hotel name   but ultimately disappointing  Uneventful dated s room oration hot water faucet in bathroom leaked constantly   tried reaching front desk to have them fix it and there was nobody ever available to help  Room phone gave out after a day front desk management quottoo busyquot to attend this very simple request   fix the faucet  OK Dreadfully slow laptop connection and yes   NO Wi FI available  Air conditioning got me sick do they ever change the filter guess not since my sinuses were literally killing me  I was truly disappointed with this hotel  frankly I went for the FANCY name wo first reviewing it on this site   learned my lesson  Please stay elsewhere in Chicago   there are plenty of options know what Im talking about  
N => Disliked the Chicago Swissotel Trouble in this hotel began when I entered the room and found it to be a room designed for disabled people and next to the elevator bank  I went straight back to reception and got a new room so up I went again  It turned out to be one of the odd shaped but ok corner rooms the design being a result of the triangular she of the building  Again elevators could be heard  From talking to other guests I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx xx xxx and xx should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and downThe worst experience during my five night stay was breakfast  The lower level restaurant called Geneva is run down both the carpet and the chairs need cleaning not to mention the color design dating back approx   years  The worst were the clorox like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff  One morning the order of scrambled egg and bacon turned out to be fried eggs and sausage one other morning the french toast showed up as two slices of french toast on a bare dish all the extras were just missing  What a sight The staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple English sentence Back in the room the cleaning staff never made it there before pm in the afternoon not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city And due to the lack of a sign you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready Upon checkout I was told that the printer was offline and no receipt could be printed but was promised to get a pdf file per email asap  As one could expect nothing happened and only after writing to the GM could I finally get the invoice I needed for the expense reporting Alltogether this seems to be a somewhat run down place far from its old glory and catering to a two  to three star crowd of tourists conference attendees and at least over the weekend the wedding croud  No reason to return to this place there are better places more or less just around the corner  Sad to write this as a previous key customer of Swissotel a chain which seems to be at the end of its lifecycle  
N => Dont stay here when a convention is in town which is all the time I stayed at this property during the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons  I made the reservation well in advance  When I arrived they stuck me in a conference room with a Murphy bed because they were overbooked  A TV had been rolled in on a stand and a little circular table placed in the middle of the floor to serve as a quotdesk quot Their quotcompensationquot for this inconvenience was half off the nightly rate  They should have given me the room for free I spoke with the manager who did not even apologize and would offer nothing more not even a free meal or a discount the next time I stayed there  It was a horrible experience  I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms  Still nothing  It was like he wanted to say quot     youquot without actually saying it  
N => Generally good value We stayed at the Swiss in t  during the week  The hotel was not very full so that was nice  Generally considering the location it is a good value hotel  There are a few issues that I think need to be addressed  FIrst at check in the desk staff individuals were a bit rude and almost seemed to be looking down at people who are not business travelers  The hotel definitely caters to business travelers and so perhaps regular tourists are not important to them  The room was nice basic and clean  The bathroom was also alright except for the need to be cleaned on the edges by the walls seemed to have lots of dust  Little touches like putting the toilet paper roll into a triangle each day were nice but they failed to replenish the supply of toilet paper and tissues  These are not huge problems as not hotel is perfect but I think pointing them out is beneficial to some travellers  In general the place was nice and worth its money given its proximity to major landks in downtown Chicago  It is your avergave clean comfortable hotel but dont expect to be blown away  
N => overrated but what a great view I have stayed at  different Chicago hotels over the years and was really looking forward to finally checking out the Swissotel  The reputation for pampering was not in evidence during our stay  The general feel was not what I would expect from a hotel with the reputation of the Swissotel  The room overall was a bit stale and tired  I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way with the exception of the lovely concierge I was impressed with the soft beds and quietness considering a major convention was in town  The location is three long blocks east of the Michigan Ave bridge   some  find this inconvenient particularly when coffee is needed However walking directly over to Millenium Park was a plus  I would not choose to stay here again for my next trip to Chicago  
N => If you get a great deal    It took me a while to get down to writing reviews but this was the second time we stayed at the Swissotel  We got an amazing deal on travelocity where we got a deluxe riverlake view for an incredibly good price  When we arrived they had a King bed reserved but instead we got stuck with two doubles so they moved us to a higher floor  Front desk staff were not super easy to work with but it wasnt too bad  Not as central to everything as we would have liked   not convienent to walk to Navy Pier but convienent to bus stops and everything else we wanted to see  Honestly I would rate the service and location a three the rooms a four and the view a five The view of where the river meets the lake is what makes this hotel magnificent Although they seem to have plopped up some apartment buildings so the view seems a bit obstructed now  We love Chicago and will return as often as we can   if we get a good deal well stay at the Swissotel again 
N => Great deal for a great location  My husband and I recently stayed two nights at the Swissotel  We booked our room after finding a   rate through travelzoo  To save money on parking fees we parked at the Millennium parking garage and walked to the hotel  We arrived early Friday evening and were able to check in very quickly  Less than  minutes after walking in the front door we were in our room  The room itself was exactly as we expected  It was a non smoking room with a king size bed desk area with two chairs a reading chair with ottoman and lamp and other standard room ammenities  We were on the th floor and had a view which included some of the Chicago skyline and water  When we returned to our room on Saturday night it had been nicely cleaned  On Sunday we used the express check out option which was very easy  When we returned home we had a receipt waiting in our email inbox  Overall the hotel was great  However if you want the picky details here you go     The toilet paper was horribly thin  Its a small detail but could easily be improved  Also on Saturday morning we woke up and there wasnt any hot water  We had to wait about an hour before we could shower and leave  It didnt really bother us but if we had been on a tight schedule it really would have been a problem  Also the scale in the bathroom didnt work   but who wants to weight themselves on a weekend away from home Again overall the hotel is a great place to stay   especially if you can find a discount  The location is great for walking up MI Ave  And if the weather is good and you love walking you could even manage to walk to the museum campus   we made the long walk on one occasion because the weather was nice and we werent in a hurry  To give you an idea of the location we walked to Bistro  Heaven on Seven Shaws Crab House Mill  Park Grant Park the Hancock Building and many other places  
N => Nice Hotel poor follow through We went to go see the Toulouse Lautrec exhibit  Got a package through the hotel which was nice of them to offer on the club level  The club level was nice but some of the guests of the club level appeared not to be the same calibre as most   it was weird  Nice hotel but not spectacular  View from room was okay not great  I also called the concierge in advance and bought expensive tickets to a Cubs game through the hotels suggested broker  We got the tickets just fine with a nice typed letter etc  But when we went to the game we were told that the game time had been moved and that we completely missed the game  I tried to approach the management about this since being from out of town not sure how we would have known this and I got back a typed note with misspelled words in it   and nothing else   basically just   its not our fault  Poor customer service  
N => Awful place When I arrived after midnight having confirmed my reservation twice including just a few hours before when Ill called from the airport upon finding that my flight had been delayed they told me that they had overbooked and that I now had no room so they were sending me to a comparable hotel nearby  They sent me across town to an awful noisy foul place  The next morning they refused my request for a written record to use in regard to related charges they also lied to me to the group that had organized the meeting etc  about what had happened  Folks attending the meeting who had stayed there reported various problems so Im not sure I missed out on anything other than sleep  
N => Overrated My husband and I travel quite a bit and just returned home from a Chicago vacation  We loved the city but were not impressed with the Swissotel at all  The employees were very rude to us and did not care if we were treated with respect or not  Upon arrival to our room we found that our TV was not properly working and would begin making an awful noise after being on a channel for   minutes  I called to request someone look at the TV and replace it or allow us to move to another room  I was told an quotengineerquot would be up to look at it but no one ever showed up  Needless to say we spent  days with a bad TV that was annoying to say the least  The room was okay but I have stayed in much nicer for much less money  The package advertised free internet access and we found they offer internet access for  day I also read in the welcome book that local calls were free and we were charged for the  LOCAL calls we made when we checked out All in all I think this hotel is HIGHLY overrated and there were much nicer hotels with more to offer for less money all over downtown Chicago  If youre looking for a nice plush place to stay keep looking and spend your money elsewhere  
N => Swissotel   A Great place to stay  After reading alot of hotel reviews on Tripsaver my wife and I liked what most people had to say about the Swissotel  So we booked a three night stay for the first week in t  We were not disappointed  From the beautiful lobby to the freindly staff to the spacious room we were impressed  The view from our room was spectacular  It overlooked the river the lake and Navy Pier  We were in walking distance of most everything we wanted to see  Millenium park  loved the bean  Mag mile Rush and State streets and Navy Pier  you have to have lunch at Bubba Gumps   We also had dinner one night at the Palms in the Swissotel  The food was excellent  We plan on coming back to Chicago during the Christmas season to do some shopping and see all the orations and yes we will stay at the Swissotel  What a GREAT city 
N => Very Satisfied With Our Stay My wife and I recently spent a night at this hotel after booking a room through Priceline  We were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews regarding the attitude of the staff especially since we booked the room through a discount site  Our worries were put to rest the minute we pulled up to the front of the hotel and turned our car over to the valet  The service we experienced was top notch and everyone was extremely pleasant  Check in and check out were both very quick and painless  We had a room on the th floor and had partial view of the lake  The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable  After the initial booking through Priceline I called and requested a king non smoking room and they were more than willing to give that to us The location of this hotel was very close to shopping on Michigan Ave and was a short walk to Navy Pier  We will definately stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others  
N => Great hotel wonderful experience While reading other reviews I see that which room you stay in makes all the difference  Unfortunately I cannot remember the room I stayed in though I think it was around the th floor and overlooked the water I had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby to the quality of the room to the view to the room service to the food  The restaurant we ate from was the Palm in the hotel and is very well known for its high quality  I was not disappointed  There was some delay in receiving our order but they made up for it by delivering a dessert for free  I thought the bathroom particularly well appointed clean and roomy  It was worth the money  
N => Very Nice Hotel We booked our hotelairfare package with United Airlines  We got a great price on our hotel and airfare so this left me suspicious of our hotel accommodations  We were very pleased with the hotel Our room had a nice view not the best but it was nice The only real complaint was that we had a room by the elevator but that even was NOT loud Our room was clean and well kept I was concerned that the hotel staff would not be KID friendly but they were all great They brought up an extra robe for our child upon request and when the ice machine was broke on the surrounding floors around us the hotel staff went and got our ice for us The night prior to our departure my husband called to find the business center to print our boarding passes but they were closed for the day  The staff who answered the phone was happy to hang around so that he could complete his business  Overall our stay was pleasant and I would consider staying there again  
N => Swissotel Chicago   A Big Disappointment With the exception of the hotels location it was otherwise a huge disappointment  I booked through Alpharooms as it was less expensive than booking with the hotel directly although it was by no means cheap   around  per nights for a twin room but what I didn t realise is that I would be treated as an inferior guest  I felt like a second class citizen I e mailed the hotel about  weeks before I was due to arrive   requesting that they confirm the reservation and asking them to note my request for a room on as high a floor as possible  the hotel has over  floors  They didn t bother to reply to my e mail  When I checked in on arrival a rather frosty faced receptionist whose English seemed limited although this  just have been due to her extremely formal manner told me that the highest floor she could offer was the th  There was no mention that they had received my e mail requesting a high floor  but regretted that non were available  nor was there an explanation of their policy as I later found out that the higher floors were reserved for their frequent guests or for those who had paid a higher room rate The room I had been allocated had been adequately made up but was far from clean   I could write my name in the dust on the shelf above the bed  I phoned down and explained this to the reception and told them the room was unacceptable as it was  They didn t seem particularly interested in my complaint but merely sent a key up for another room which was on an even lower floor Two evenings later I had to get dressed to go down to the bar as they had not bothered to restock my minibar   again when I mentioned it to reception they didn t seem interested The final straw was that the day before leaving I returned to my room one afternoon to find that someone had been in and left a part used packet of cigarettes there  I mentioned this to the reception by phone and again as I was going out later that evening but again they didn t seem interested  The cigarettes I assume and hope were left by the maid although it was a non smoking floor  The worst senario is that an unknown person had been in my room whilst I was out  The hotel didn t seem interested so I will never know I certainly would not recommend this hotel and if this is the typical standard of Swissotels then I would not consider staying in one again  
N => The BEST hotel yet This was our third trip to Chicago this year we LOVE the city   every time we stay at a different downtown hotel  Swissotel was definitely our favourite  When we come back in y to see the play quot Wickedquot for the second time we will be again at Swissotel  No more need to try other hotels The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile  The room was spotless and quiet the view amazing and those elevators were so fast  Comfortable beds friendly service not as many noisy sirens We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed This was the best anniversary ever  We would recommend Swissotel to everyone 
N => Unexpected snotty service While the rooms are quite nice I was dised by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago  I was there for five nights attending a conference and was staying at a different hotel than my boss who had the business credit card  When I attempted to check in I stated that I wished to drop off my luggage in the room and to freshen up and that I could provide the credit card used to reserve the room in an hour when my boss would be there for us to go to dinner  I didnt want a hold placed on one of my personal cards At first they were not going to allow me to check in  They didnt give me any option either  I persisted and ended up having to give the front desk one of my personal checks in order to receive the room key  I then realized they were going to place a hold on my account anyway which was fine as I had the funds and was simply wanting to get checked in Even though I had about  in my account there was an error with the hotels communication with my bank  I was told that my check wasnt any good  As far as the hotel clerk was concerned I could just walk away have a seat with all my luggage and wait  I asked if I could use her phone to call my bank  When my bank informed me that I had the funds I asked my bank representative to give this information to the clerk  She did so  When they ended their conversation however this clerk asked her manager right in front of me  how they could trust that it was indeed my bank that Id called  She said I could have just called some friend  I was flabbergasted  Thankfully the manager permitted me to check in and they held my check An hour later when my boss arrived for dinner I produced the credit card and asked for my check back  I was told that the clerk who had assisted me was on dinner break and that Id have to come back later  My boss took over the conversation and asked why that should matter  Ten minutes later I had my check  So while the rooms are very nice I will never stay at a Swissotel again in any city  
N => Great corner room view but parkingexecutive lounge prices a rip off This was our rd or th stay at the Swissotel and we always stay in a deluxe king corner room for the wonderful panoramic views of the river Navy Pier and the lake  The skyline is gorgeous  The location does require a little bit more walking to get to the Mag Mile etc  but we didnt mind the exercise at all   As a VISA platinum member I qualified for a room upgrade but we didnt need it since a king corner room is lovely enough free breakfast each day and late check out at  p m  I had to show the desk clerk a print out of their own website in order to get the free breakfast and late check out  He seemed confused about the hotels own offers  I was hoping that since we didnt get a room upgrade that wed be allowed access to the executive lounge but no go   they wanted an additional   per night  for that  We felt it absurd to pay that much to have a glass of wine or two and a few cheese cubes so we lined that lovely offer  We have used the executive lounge in past stays but it was built into our room rate deal  I guess the  charge is to weed out the riff raff out or something  The staff up there does tend to treat guests like recent parolees who might be about to commit new crimes or somehow misbehave  Chilly   The room was beautiful spacious and very quiet  The brunch was average  We also ate dinner in the Palm Restaurant and it was fine but nothing to write home about   We foolishly paid the rapacious day parking charges  If we return we will park in the Millennium parking garage  But I think were ready to try someplace new and use the  we save on shopping and dining 
N => pretty great Got an unbelievably great rate on this hotel on Hotwire com  Cost me more to park my car in their garage overnight than to stay there  Room was terrifically comfortable quiet and spacious  Great view of Lake Michigan  Terrific towels toiletries bathroom  Highly recommended  
N => Excellent room I loved the room we had  th floor   very comfortable bed beautiful bathroom and spotlessly clean  It was also extremely quiet despite full capacity  And because of this check out was between noon and pm so it was great to be able to relax and take our time My only disappointment was with the person who checked us in  He was extremely rude  We misunderstood one of his questions and he came just short of rolling his eyes  I could not believe it  Left me speechless to be honest  He is the reason I am rating the stay average  Otherwise everything else was excellent  
N => NOT BAD I was somewhat nervous about this selection for lodging after Hotwire    night handed it to me because I was not familar with this hotel  Guess what VERY GOOD AND BETTER YET FOR THIS PRICE IT IS A STEAL  A great view no hassle checkinout  Excellent housekeeping  
N => Noisy Swissotel rooms A  star hotel with  star aspirations  I booked through Hotels com and got a nice view room on the st floor  Problem was from  am until  am whenever an adjacent room turned on their plumbing I heard loud knocking read quotwake you upquot loud  When I complained to the front desk manager he condescendingly explained that all hotels had noisy plumbing  WTFGot moved to another room  Wont be coming back here  Also a longer walk to the Mag Mile shops than I had thought  
N => Nice hotel Ive stayed here in    and my first impression of the hotel was that it had a nice lobby  When we went into our rooms everything was cozy  We had a great view of Lake Erie  The front desk was very helpful in getting whatever we needed  The cleaning staff was superb and everything was accessible  The hotel is located near the Loop even though you would have to walk about  blocks to get to that area  But aside from that i would defly come back to the hotel  
N => Horrible experience I had heard of Swissotel and had the impression that it was a high quality hotel  Unfortunately for my family and I that just was not the case  My family and I recently stayed in the Chicago hotel     and I was so completely disappointed in both the room and the service that not only will I never stay in one of their facilities again but I will certainly encourage all of my friends and family to do the same  I was lucky to have come across a wonderful promotion through QuikBook that offered both a discounted rate as well as a Breakfast Buffet for any attendees between ust and the end of tember  So I booked our trip and my family and I were very excited about our trip  When we arrived the person who checked us in said that he had no record of our complimentary Breakfast Buffet and after showing him my confirmation from QuikBook he said that he would have someone bring the certificates to our room later  I also inquired about the possibility of a corner room and a view of the water which I had requested with my reservation  The gentleman explained to me that since I had requested two double beds no corner room offered that accommodation they only offered a single king size bed  I told him no problem and since he didnt mention the water view I assumed he had assigned that to me  When my family and I got to our room we were extremely disappointed to find that our view was over a very large dirt lot I believe the building next door had been torn down and no water in sight  I called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms  Basically I was told that because I had booked through QuikBook I was getting the best room I could expect for the rate that I paid  I asked to speak to the manager on duty John Murdock who told me that he could do nothing to help me he reiterated again because I had booked through QuikBook that they would not accommodate me and if I didnt like it I could leave and he would not charge me a cancellation fee  I was shocked and scared At this point it was close to  pm and my first fear was that my family and I would be stranded in Chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel  I called QuikBook and was relieved to have been able to speak with a live person who immediately called the hotel to work everything out  Thank goodness someone was available at QuikBook but again had the manager been the least bit sympathetic or helpful he could have accomplished the same thing Anyway they ended up moving us to another room that did have a water view but after we got settled in the room we realized that they had just pawned us off on a room with a view yes but with a multitude of other problems  Due to the location of our room we heard the elevator go up and down all hours of the day  There was no lid over the water reservoir on our coffee maker  The telephone on the desk did not work  The clock did not work  They locked us out of our room on the second day and did not clean our room until we got back at  pm  We requested additional towels and pillows and it was only after the third request that we got them  Honestly I felt that because I had complained the manager was going out of his way to irritate us  You  be thinking that I am a difficult person because you dont know me or anything about me  But I can tell you that this is the first time I have ever written a complaint letter and I have stayed in a variety of different hotels and have experienced all kinds of situations  We travel extensively and I can tell you that the scenario in Chicago could have been avoided had the manager taken any amount of time to use some form of customer service  The fact that another person out of the building could affect our situation shows that arrangements could have been made had the manager been so inclined  Our trip to Chicago was fabulous with the exception of our accommodations  
N => Not as sharp as other Swissotels    We were disappointed by the averageness of this Swissotel especially in relation to its cost per night  Granted our room had a KILLER VIEW of Lake Michigan and a very comfortable bed but aside from that we werent happy that each morning our quotDo Not Disturbquot sign was slipped under our door between  to  a m  followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasnt out the hotels extremely limited cable service only  channels our housekeeper didnt refillreplace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time our room service on two occasions brought us coldsoggy  and very late  food the lobby bar closes at  p m  on Sunday theres no weekend newspaper  Oh well  at least we had fun outside of the hotel 
N => Great Stay w Kids We had a great stay at the Swissotel in ust   We took the kids and loved the location  We were able to easily walk to Navy Pier  We could also get to Michigan Ave  quickly where we could hop on a trolley to get to our shopping destinations  The room was very nice  The view was absolutely incredible  I had gotten a great deal on hotwire com and was nervous after reading other reviews about the hotel overbooking  We had no problems  The staff was friendly and helpful  Would definately stay again  
N => Disappointing We did not have a very good experience at the swissotel  Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a  star hotel  They couldnt honor our early check in request did not give us a lakeview as requested several leaks in the bathroom requested extra pillows amp towels only  in room and it took over  hours and  phone calls one phone not working etc  All in all we were disappointed in this hotel I know we will stay elsewhere next time  Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel amp I felt the service and hotel were much better  
N => Worth it Got a deal on Hotwire and was initially sceptical given the reviews where people who booked through Hotwire got bumped  However we didnt have one single problem  Room was great clean nice view of the river  Walking distance to Miracle Mile Navy Pier Institute of Art  You do end up getting taxis to certain areas esp at night but it was worth it  and i think this is this case no matter where you stay in Chicago  Staff were very helpful   when there was a problem with the bill it was immediately cleared up with no arguing or hassle  
N =>   The hotel was nice we got a corner room on the  floor  It was a bit pricey night  I have only a few complaints the bathroom counter was not cleaned there were coffee spots and beard trimmings which is really gross and my complementary moisturizer was already opened  Besides that it was nice  Chicago is REALLY expensive we wont be coming back to stay the weekend again cant afford it  
N => Great location  Fantastic view  Exceptional rooms and service I took my fiance to chicago durring our christmas trip to see my family  We stayed one night in the Swissotel Chicago It was fantastic the room was amazing we stayed on the nd floor and the view was amazing  They treated us like royalty the staff assisted us with information on some wonderful resturants and after hours entertainment  The kingsize bed had a down comforter and feather pillows  We had robes to wear  Swissotel gave me the oppertunity to really impress my future spouse not just by the stay but by the great price I paid as well I can only repay them by letting others know just how fantastic they made our trip Thanks Swissotel We will be staying with you from now on 
N => Awesome New Years Eve Although I live in Chicago my friends and I felt that we should rent a room for NYE  From the moment we parked the car with valet I knew we were in for a treat The hotels lobby is small but its a nice change from overwhelming large lobbies of other hotels  The front desk person was very polite when we checked in Security was tight at the hotel as we had to present a room key to go to the guest elevators  This was nice as we were  young ladies traveling alone The room very very spacious and the washroom was beautiful ble everywhere a large soaking tub and a erate shower Also in room coffee maker was complimentry Check out was very fast as was getting our car from valet  As we were driving off a valet person chased after us  We pulled over and he told us that our tire looked rather low  He gave us detailed directions to the nearest gas station  I just thought that he went above and beyond by making sure we knew about the tire I would stay here again especially for a weekend shopping trip 
N => One Good One Bad I stayed at the Swissotel this past summer and found it very nice  I booked a room through hotwire for the Chicago athon weekend  Yes I paid for the room in advance When athon weekend came though I was bumped out due to overbooking by the Swissotel  I had reconfirmed my reservation a week earlier then at the last moment I was bumped and left scrambling  They offered a room  miles out in the suburbs as compensation which was not acceptable  I booked the room for the location I was able to find another room in the city and the Swissotel has promised to reimbuse me the difference in my stay  I am still waiting for my check from them  
N => Beautiful Hotel   Service Slightly Lacking We made reservations for the Swissotel at Quickbook for a CONCEIRGE LEVEL ROOM the upper floors of the Swissotel  When we went they had a special deal where if you showed a different hotels rewards card you would get free airline miles for staying at the Swissotel  We showed them our Wyndham By Request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a complimentary upgrade to a conceirge level room   not both rooms but one room  Strange we thought since we had booked conceirge level rooms  So this would not be an upgrade but simply giving us what we booked and payed more for  We later about  minutes later   after seeing the lower level room asked for a conceirge level room and they told us that there was a conference and people were checking out late and they apologized   and then went ahead and moved us to the conceirge level It seems to me IF THEY ONLY HAD ONE CONCEIRGE ROOM READY they would give us the one conceirge room and ask us if we would like to wait for the second room to be ready instead of moving us to a lower level room since we were paying more for the conceirge level room  And dont tell us were getting an upgrade when thats what we booked  I guess perhaps they figure many people who use discount hotel sites on the web dont really know what they are getting room wise and so they didnt really have to give us a conceirge level room  Who knows but it was not professional The rooms with the Navy Pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level Currents was an excellent dining experience  Its a nice hotel but we felt patronized because we did not book directly through the Swissotel  
N => Disappointing this time Ive stayed here twice before and completely loved it but it was over  years ago  Alot of the common areas that I enjoyed so much a lower level promenade with shops such as a swiss bakery have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms  Now nothing much seems to be going on here and the hotel offered me nothing more than an expensive room and an expensive place to park my car  You also have to pay an extra  a day for using the exercise facility which is nice enough but at that extra cost I was amazed to find they didnt provide bottled water    there was a bottle machine Come on     nothing like nickle and diming you  To be fair the room was very nice with a beautiful view of Navy Pier at night  For the price I think I could do much much better next time  I wont be staying here again  
N => Was almost a pleasure  
N => I Want To Go Back  
N => Pricey But Perfect  
N => Room and service was horrible When we arrived at the hotel we were properly greeted and taken up to our rooms  When we got into our room the furniture inside was stained and really beat up  The worst part of the room was the bathroom door  The bathroom was fitted with a sliding door that did not go into the wall but alongside it  The door had no lock and left about a   inch gap where if you walked by it you could see someone on the toilet  The concierge was not helpful on suggestions of restraunts or nightlife  The concierge told us that we were better off staying in our rooms since there was quotnothing to do in chicago after  pmquot  Our last night we ordered a movie and the quality of the movie was horrid movie was pixelating and blurry so we called down and I had to argue with the person at the front desk to have them credit us the money back for the movie after we had stopped it less than  minutes in  This is not a full service hotel we had to pay about  bucks for anything and everything  We had to pay about  dollars to have them bring us up extra glasses since the old ones were dirty and the maid did not switch them out  The only redeeming thing about my trip was the fun I had with my friends not the hotel  
N => Enjoyable stay  I stayed at the Blackstone for  nights during ober Overall I was pleased with the hotel  The staff are friendly and the facilities still look fairly new  The d cor did not bowl me over not to my taste but it was clean and thats the main thingThe room faced the park and lake so it was nice to wake up to a view each morning  I did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants but did have room service  Service was prompt but what gets to me is the automatic   service charge  I realise its a standard at all the riotts I have stayed in but I dont have to like it  The room was a good size but some things left me puzzled  I assumed it was a room kitted out for people with a disabilitymobility issues given the size of the bathroom and low hanging hooks and rails but some things like having a bathtub did not make sense  I did not like the low hanging rail in my room as I could not hang anything long up  I also thought the light switches were a pain  Instead of one switch each light had  dials to fiddle with and it wasnt obvious at least to me how to control them  I just kept pressing until something happened  The room was also furnished with a low chairhigh desk combo  It might look good but I did not find it practical for either eating or working The only thing not acceptable was the cleanliness of the towels  Everyday I was given new towels and without fail there was always at least one in the pile that was stained  The hotel is within walking distance from a number of attractions and transport options  In honesty I would probable stay at a more centrally located hotel on a future visit  
N => Solid Service This is an older hotel that has been refurbished  Staff works hard to provide outstanding service  Rooms were nice but small compared to more modern hotels  Very close to Field Museum Shed Aquarium etc  Good for couples Glad my kids stayed at home  
N => Totally Disappointed The reception was terrible the valet   thats why service is not a part of their title the bees not the best addition in a room with an infant  We stayed there almost a week when my wife was at a training at the Hilton  I am a riot Rewards member but surely that did not do much in their eyes  From the start we were treated as though we did not belong there  There was no formal welcome except from the Valet service  We wanted to park ourselves big mistake  We traveled with an infant and had many things but the Valet told the bellboy to take our luggage off his cart  The Valet wouldt even budge to open the door in the absence of a greeter  You have to climb stairs to get to the lobby from the outside  Even with all the luggage that comes with traveling with an infant the Valet didnt even think to tell us that there was an elevator  We had to discover this on our own  We were in line but the front desk served someone else better dressed than us first  Then we got the quotroom with the viewquot that also came with wasps  We complained to the front desk but we had to again ask this time with the housekeeping staff  They caulked up the hole with no guarantees  We asked to be moved and no help was offered in moving the crib and everything else we had to lug ourselves  We talked to the manager and got a plate of stinking cheese  We complained after getting back and got an email for more information  We responded  It is now a month and a half later and yet not a response  We should have stayed at the Hilton across the street  We will use up all points and cut the rewards card  Thanks Blackstone for ruining a good relationship The best thing about the stay were the nice housekeeping folks  Management could learn alot from them  For those that are wheelchair bound go somewhere else because you have to open the doors yourself and the elevator is too small  
N => Blown away by the service and accomodations We stayed at the Blackstone in early ust to go to the Lollapalooza Music Festival and to visit area colleges  We were really blown away by all aspects of the hotel except for reservations but I will get to that later  The service in the hotel was really topnotch and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful  Room service went out of their way to accommodate us when we arrived after  p m  and required vegan choices for my dhter  The food was excellent in both the Mercat Restaurant and room service which I often try to avoid  The staff did an incredible job as the hotel was completely booked and it was very hectic for the first three days we were here  Even our housekeeping service was friendly and accommodating  It did appear that everyone that worked here really enjoyed their job and was interested in making sure you were happy  The rooms were very comfortable  Plenty of space and well laid out  The beds were extremely comfortable  The bathrooms were spacious and we loved the walk in shower no bathtub  We were also surprised that the rooms were pretty quiet  No noise from the street but we could definitely hear the music festival although this didnt bother us as it ended at  p m  every night  The weather was brutally hot   high s but our room and the rest of the hotel was always nice and cool The location is good if you are interested in going to the museums and aquarium as well as spending time in the parks  The restaurants within walking distance were somewhat limited  The one area that we had a problem was with reservations  I requested a double room two beds connected to a king room  I was later sent an email letting me know that my request was not available although I did not realize this at first as I thought it was just a confirmation  Once I realized this I called the hotel back and was told that I should call two weeks before arrival and was led to believe that this would be possible  I called two weeks out and was told to call back a few days before arrival  When I did this I was told to call back two days before arrival and when I did this I was told to call the day before and then the day of  During this time not once was I told that there are very few rooms in the hotel that have doubles I think it is one per floor and that the likelihood was not good that one would be available  In addition to that these are also the only rooms that connect  We ended up with two rooms each with a king that did not connect  This definitely effected our trip as my husband and I each had to share a room and a bed with one of our children  In the end the accommodations and service made us glad that we stayed here  
N => In A Word   Spectacular My wife and I were celebrating our nd Wedding Anniversary and ided on The Blackstone Hotel on Michigan Ave  in Chicago  Before our stay we were contacted via email with a personal note regarding our arrival  This was a very nice touch  I informed them of our anniversary and when we arrived at our room we had been upgraded to a lake view room the view was spectacular on a beautiful tember Chicago day and we had a bottle of wine and appetizer awaiting us  It was truely a surprise  Molly in the sales department should be commended for taking such good care of us on our special day The room was very ecclectic and comfortable  I was blown away by how nice the hotel had been redone  It was orated in dark rich colors and there was attention paid to every detail  The room was spacious with a king bed and comfortable  Even though our room lacked a tub the shower was very nice and the quotrainshowerquot head was out of this world relaxing  Our room overlooked the lake and the city and was the best part of the room  If given the choice in the future I would definately pay extra to upgrade to this type of room again   it was that special  About the only bad thing I can say about the room  was that the noise was a little noticable from the city  floors below which was a surprise  We only noticied it in the morning and only when there was an ambulance or morning train whistle  Otherwise we never noticed anything during the night  We requested early chcek in and late check out and it was not a problem and the staff could not have been more accomodating to us  We had drinks at the Mercat Bar and they were fantastic  I really have never felt so quottaken care ofquot while staying at a hotel  Only one person knew it was our anniversary but it seemed as though everyone knew and applied the special touch  Again The Blacksone Hotel in Chicago is now my favorite quotHome away from homequot when I visit the city  
N => We Loved It I have to say this is one of the better hotels we have stayed in in awile  I am started to think custoner service and proper cleaning was a thing of the past but the Blackstone met all of my expectations  We reserved a King size room so we had no problem like the previous posters with bed size  The room was very nice  Nice oration white duvet cover not a comforter which skeeves me  The bathroom was very roomy although it does not have a tub so if you like a tub this is not the place for you  The lighting was also very nice in the room almost all lights had dimmers  There were also several mirrors so if someone was in the bathroom you could have an alternate place to get ready  I also liked that there were roman shades which blocked out the light at night  Nice soaps etc We did not know Lollapalooza was going to be going on so when we saw the lobby filled with teenagers and their parents we were a bit worried we would hear noise all night long but we didnt  The workout room was great  It was very large  rooms with just about every weight machine any mid size gym would have plus free weights  There were also several nice new treadmills ellipticles and a couple of bikes  All had TVs attatched to them which was nice My one recommendation would be that if you do want a pop or water dont get it from the little gift shop in the hotel it costs   Go the the CVS around the corner We would stay here again  
N => Nice hotel The hotel was really nice  My room was orated really nicely  The bed was comfortable  Nice toiletries  The location was great  Easy walk to restaurants and the museum area  The staff was very friendly  The room service was over priced but otherwise I really liked this hotel  
N => Re born but not yet mature The good bits first   friendly check in staff modern rooms with a boutique hotel feel superbly comfortable bed shower no bath small rooms even though we apparently had a slightly larger one  To be honest taken at face value this hotel is fine   the problems occur when you scratch the surface  Its apparently a  star hotel sadly the girl on reception didnt know this  We requested and paid for a lake view room and sure enough our room faced the lake but   when the room was re designed the TV was put bang slap in the middle of the window   completely obscuring the wonderful view   even the staff were bemused by this and no neither the desk nor TV could be moved   both firmly screwed down  Apparently some rooms have TVs on the wall   well I never There were none of the things you would expect to find in a  star hotel   no one offered to help with our bags saved on the tip I guess no writing paper or sewing kit cheap toiletries thankfully we had our own  I believe this is a riott   it certainly feels like a fairly typical US riott albeit wearing a nice frock  There is a very small rather dingy bar which smelled rather damp and a Tapas bar with an award winning chef but sadly it just didnt seem appetising fortunately Chicago is awash with great eateries So with no view to admire we ided to indulge in a cup of coffee in the bar   oh no we couldnt not in the bar not even in the lobby even though it was only pm on a Saturday  The on sight Starbucks   allegedly open till pm closes at pm staff know this but havent changed room info  We were told we could only have coffee via room service or The Hilton opposite   and you know what   if youre planning on a trip to Chicago we suggest thats where you go   we could have got a better rate for Hilton   we will go back to Chicago its a truly amazing city but not to Blackstone there are simply too many better hotels for the same or less dosh  
N => Great hotel but    We stayed at the Blackstone over Memorial Day weekend  Paid  a night through a Travelzoo promotion  Without a doubt one of the great bargains in Chicago  While the hotel itself was  star the maid service was  star  In spite of generous tips each morning the only sign a maid had been in the room was a made bed and clean towels  Everything else was basically the same  We even called for a re clean one night while we were out for dinner and the only thing we noticed was the radio on playing soothing music and chocolates on our bed  The floor still had not been vacuumed  Had we been paying nearly  a night like our friends I would have been very disappointed in the experience but at  even with ginal cleaning the Blackstone is a great deal  
N => Great Physical Plant Staff Needs Help We love Renaissance hotels but had some serious service issues at the Blackstone  Here is a part of the letter we sent them describing the problems we encountered Although our flight was delayed in San Francisco I phoned the Blackstone from the tarmac   SFO and advised the front desk that we would be arriving on the date reserved but without the early check in as previously arranged months ago They said that would be fine  When our plane touched down   OHare I called the Blackstone and was put on hold  My call was not picked up so I called again from the taxi en route to the Blackstone to be told our room had been sold and there was no room of any kind available in the hotel  I requested assisted in seeking a room at a comparable hotel and was told by the front desk manager that this was not possible Our reservation had been made as I mentioned months earlier and comfirmed prior to our departure from San Francisco We were instructed by the front desk manager to proceed to the downtown riott not the same hotel class as the Renaissance where a room would be waiting for us   when we arrived at the riott they had never heard of us and werent very friendly about it  Finally after much ado they gave us a room  We were told by the Blackstone that a room would be ready for us at the Blackstone the next morning    it wasnt  After the riott staff came to our door and told us we had exceeded check out time we took a taxi to the Blackstone never reimbursed by the Blackstone  They held our lugggage and we went out to kill time       when we returned a room was finally available  We were told we were given an upgrade  I dont think it was an upgrade as the room had no bath tub and looked like the picture of the one we had reserved months ago  When I called after seeing there was no bath tub we were told no room with a lake view and two beds and a bathtub existed in the entire hotel     its a  room hotel There were problems with getting the room cleaned in a timely manner at one point I found myself carrying out room service trays you will find room service to be slow and trying to straighten out the room before my husband got back from his business meeting in the late afternoon    something I have never had to do previously regardless of hotel class We are not demanding people but in my opinion we were rather badly and patronizingly handled by hotel staff  I was a little fearful that issues like this might occur when I saw on tripadvisor that someone else had to find their own parking at the Hilton without much help from Blackstone staff shortly after grand opening following the reation We have stayed at the Renaissance Chancery Court in London and have always had a flawless stay there which is why we selected the Blackston when we were on business in Chicago  
N => Beautiful but small I booked a special quotanniversary ratequot on the club level of the restored Blackstone Renaissance Hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday  The information given me by reservations was incorrect especially about the club level details complimentary cocktails   NOT and I specifically requested to know the size of the room and was quoted  sqft  Upon checking in we were given a corner lake view room as requested on the club level  We we arrived at the room about  of the square footage was a long hallway  The or resembles a W rather than a Renaissance but it was new beautiful and clean  There was a very comfortable king sized bed and a desk under the flat screen TV  There was a chair stuck in next to the desk but there was no place to read or watch the TV other than the bed  We were there to enjoy our stay at the hotel and since it was raining and we live in Chicago we were there more for the hotel than the sights  It was very disappointing  Another non view room had been prepared for us with our riott preferences and when the desk clerk changed the room to the requested lake view he set someone up with the additional pillows  Someone from housekeeping arrived with a refrigerator no room for that   we sent it away and one king sized pillow in a dirty standard pillowcase  I called the front desk to ask for the rest of our down pillows and the housekeeping manager showed up and said that the king sized pillow wasnt even from their hotel   Very Strange  When speaking to the front desk about a room change we were informed that the historic landking prevented changes on the inside of the hotel and they were not even allowed to put in a pool  So although it is a beautiful restoration we felt there was more room in the rain showered bath than the room itself  Needless to say we checked out a day early  
N => Lakeview rooms are fantastic I surprised my stressed hubby with a trip to Chicago and we stayed at the Blackstone  I wasnt sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hotel    and then our room  Fantastic hotel very clean great location convenient to many attractions great price We will definitely be staying there on future visits  
N => A hotel to make you smile My husband and I traveled to the Blackstone during the week while he attended a show at the conference center  What an amazing experience it was at the Blackstone  From the moment we arrived the valet and bellboy staff were so friendly    to the check in desk who certainly had their hands full with so many people checking in at one time  They were extremely efficient to get us in quickly The lobby had such a unique vibe to it that carried throughout the hotel    upscale classy yet in a truly funky way Our room was really nice    not a terrific view but that wasnt a concern  The room we had was pretty narrow but long  The room was furnished in highly contemporary and modern furnishings  The bed was amazingly comfortable I loved the books that they had on the bookshelves to read while I was there  The bathroom was pretty unique with a shower stall which was just a clear glass wall  The best part of the hotel was the elevators    one thing Ill never forget  You couldnt help but smile in the morning when you went in them with not your typical elevator music    rather upbeat dance music Well definitely stay here again Great location too within walking distance of an incredible breakfast place Yolk and a corner cafedeli  
N => Some of the staff was nicer than the others Ive noticed that Im big on service  So when I check in I want good service  Someone to welcome you after a long journey and give you a ent room upon arrival  I was quite unimpressed with this gentlemans service  We arrived around pm check in time per their terms to find that there were no double queen rooms remaining  Now I know that when you book via their site you merely make certain requests and they do their best to accommodate you  But when you check in on time neither early or late and they give you a room on the lowest floor th right above the gym when you requested high floors and a king bed when you requested two queens   would you be impressed All the while emphasizing that we got a  rate as if they could get more in this economy which is why we could not guarantee the double queens  I just feel that you should charge what you think you deserve for your hotel  For example if you think you are better than  and do not need the boost in traffic from people you consider less than your ideal clientele then feel free to do so  That way you weed out those you find less than worthy and you can charge the night you believe your hotel is worth  I just ask you this    how do you fit  people onto one king bed The  people we stated upon reservation I might add  Anyhow he did not make a very good effort to make us happy    The next morning the lady was also unpleasant when I asked to change rooms since the guy at check in had said it would not be a problem   but again I had difficulty communicating with her Diana  Im not sure what their problem is  But luckily we were not in the room too much and I finally got over the room situation  Other than that the staff was really nice  I particularly liked the doormen and the rest of the conciergefront desk was pleasant  They were helpful with restaurant recommendations and transportation options  The room itself was pretty nice  You can tell that it has been recently reated with comfortable bed and LG flat screen  The bathroom was fairly spacious but I will say that you should probably share a room with close family amp friends because the way the sliding door closes leaves little to the imagination  The shower did not really have a door and was all glass  so again little to the imagination  This is just in our room   I am certain that there are better rooms  The business center was great   two computers hooked up with all the internet you will need and printers as well  This is one of the best features of the hotel given that they do not provide free wireless Other fine qualities include the proximity to Grant Park though if you try to walk to certain attractions such as the Sears Tower or John Hancock it will be quite a trek  Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago are within walking distance  One downside is the lack of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel starbucks closes at  so you should probably eat before you go back to the hotel although room service was not too bad  The selection was ent and the people were nice  Other than that you have to walk to State Street under the El and the street not particularly well lit to feed yourself particularly later at night All in all it was a great value for our money despite the less than helpful guy at check in though we did not encounter him again  I would probably not go back because its a bit further south than I would have liked but definitely a beautiful hotel with nice rooms on the museum campus  Would recommend at the rate we got but I am not sure how much I more I would pay though you probably get better service with a higher rate  
N => fantastic remodeled choice This hotel was perfect for us  We were attending a convention at McCormick Place  While the Hilton next door was a convention hotel we booked a fantastic room for a fraction of the price  Travelzoo was running a promotion for  and we still got the amenities of the free shuttle with restaurants and a bar were all just next door Our room was fantastic very well furnished lit it was laid out wonderfully and the bed was unbelievably comfortable We will definitely stay again for that priceWould have given a  rating if just for a few important things The woman at the front seemed overworked the hotel was obviously understaffed We called down and explained the honor bar would not open we were simply told quotyes it does openquot well two of us are not wrong and isnt the guest supposed to be right Someone should have come up to check it  If we could not open it there is a problem  Whatever we went next door to Kitty OSheas instead Also we got a wake up call early in the morning we were up but when we informed the woman at the front that WE had NOT asked for a wake up call instead of an apology I was told that  Yes we did  Huh Even my colleague was flabbergasted what if we were sleeping inSorry we were very polite and to be told WE were the problem not once but twice really needs to be addressed by management  
N => Great View Ever since this hotel was remodeled I have wanted to spend the night  The rates have always been a little steep for me so it wasnt until the economy hit hard was I able to swing the rate  I was on cloud quotquot for my opportunity to stay here during Valentines Day weekend  Everything met or exceeded my expectations  The room was ready early as we checked in around noon  The room was well designed and the view was just the best I have ever had in Chicago  I could see all the way from Navy Pier to Soldiers field  I love the size of the hotel big enough to offer services Starbucks Spanish restaurant nice bar etc yet small enough to feel like any request would be met with good results  I cant really comment on the service as we never really needed anything  It was all right there  It was a great stay  It is my new favorite hotel in Chicago 
N => Better than expected We stayed at the Blackstone instead of the Hilton for the Cubs Convention and could not have been happier  For the view we got the lake Navy Pier Grant Park the museum campus the price was outta this world night book direct on riotts web site for best rates I found  The staff was more than accomodating   showing us all the historical points of the hotel  Neil was the best We felt like we were staying at a real expensive hotel for the service we received  The restaurant was not really for kids at least our kids said quotblahquot but a taxi can take you to lots of good places to eat  If we go back downtown and need to stay in that area we will DEFINITELY stay at the Blackstone again  
N => Chic Stay Nicely appointed property Huge bathrooms and comfy beds  The service was excellent 
N => Amazing Wow  We were very impressed with this hotel  This was our first trip to Chicago  We stayed the first two nights at The Tremont on Chestnut Street  No complaints at that hotel either but this was a pleasant change  Renaissance are always amazing but this was the best yet  All service was spectacular too  Let me continue by saying what an amazing deal this was  We booked a special of  a night which included breakfast for    the Mercat our bill was  each day What a deal  Due to our riott status we were upgraded to the club level Room  lake view king room The room was perfect  Very large lots of windows perfect view terrific bathroom with a tv in the mirror  I couldn t have been happier  The hotel was very nice otherwise  We ate at the Mercat one evening for dinner  We found it to be quite expensive for the amount of food you get tapas is the name of a wide variety of appetizers in Spanish cuisines but it was the perfect amount to have before going out and it was all delicious  We were even awarded a free dessert from the super nice server There is a lot of history with this hotel which made it extra interesting  As I said before we were spoiled with the location of The Tremont but this location was fantastic for certain things too  Museum campus was less than  minute walk away you could see the Planetarium Aquarium and Field Museum from our room actually  The L runs about two blocks behind the hotel as well so that is walking distance too  We inadvertently walked from our hotel to the Sears Tower too but that was quite a haul in the freezing temperatures but possible  There were not too many entertainment options super close at night  We were able to walk to Bar Louie a couple blocks away but there is a Bar Louie in Newport KY near Cincinnati so that wasn t new for us  There were a couple other bars nearby but we were just playing it safe considering it was so late  Otherwise terrific experience  I cant say we would pay the typical  for this hotel although it is worth it I would rather pay half that and be in a more walkable area  We spend so little time in our hotel room when traveling  
N => Great stay This reated hotel does not disappoint  Fireplace in the lobby was very appealing on a cold Chicago day  Have never enjoyed a better room or been treated better   Rate was excellent value for what we got  Recommend without reservation 
N => Unbelievable I have never been treated so well  I cant believe how friendly everyone was  We got an unbelievable room  Very big and beautifully orated  The bathroom was awesome There was even a tv in the mirror We will definately go back  
N => Cost me extra to stay here I stayed here as the media guest of a large company and though Im happy to report that the rooms are very nicely updated they are also quite small and youre going to pay extra  for DSL internet access  The beds are great and the door staff are very friendly  The only problem is that the desk staff are kids and barely know what theyre doing  I had given them my credit card for incidentals and reminded them when I checked out quotNow youre going to charge the room to THAT card my sponsors and not THIS card rightquot Confused  year old called over the  year old manager who pointed out the card the room was supposed to be charged to and I was assured there would be no problem  Sure nuff I get home and find theyve charged  to the wrong card and my checking account is now overdrawn   in overdraft fees and hours of attempts to fix it Im still waiting for my money to be refunded a week later and theyve already charged the other card  Does that sound like a  Star hotel Not to me I wont be back  
N => Furnishings and location were nice service was not They screwed up our reservation  Instead of a quotdeluxe lakeview roomquot we got a view of a brick wall on the street  The front desk clerk blamed it on Expedia  Ive never had any hotel complain about Expedia before  WHen I called Expedia they tried to take control of the situation but the hotel was uncooperative even though the hotel had faxed Expedia a signed confirmation of the room type according to Expedia  Manager Kate was a cold fish  She said that the Blackstone did not guarantee the room type  I pointed out that I had paid  more to get the view  She didnt offer any solution  I said I d take the lesser room for the usual price  She emitted heavy sighs and said she d call Expedia  I called Expedia  minutes later but Kate had not called them  I ided not to ruin the day and gave up  Upon checkout the manager nice black guy didnt catch his name called Expedia and confirmed that the charges had been reduced  Other problems a clerk took our wakeup call request but someone called at  instead of  on Sunday  I never got back to sleep because of all the sirens and street noise  The shower door was clear and the bathroom door was semi opaque glass so you might not want to share this room with someone unless you are good friends  Beds were comfy for one but not for  people  or was pretty posh but more contemporary corporate than homey  Parking was   The valet guys were very nice  The location was perfect for Taste of Chicago  
N => Trying to be a Kimpton hotel I was there for a conference from     I would give it a   because of some issues but some issues were probably specific to our situation  The Good  newly refurbished modern furniture etc   very clean room  very nice staff  cute bar although a little small  nonsmoking  Starbucks in front  good lunch restaurant  great locationThe Bad  Even though this was a conference and there were  of us in the room we had a difficult time getting them to guaranteee  beds   Beds were soft and there were too many pillows    Too much cuteness without practicalities   e g  the shower stall door went from floor to ceiling but opening it produced a lot of noise in the bedroom lots of metal bathroom fixtures soap dish garbage can which also made noise if touched only one towel rack in bathroom so we couldnt conserve our towels  Housekeeping continually left us only af coffee  They quickly brought us more when we called but this happened reapeatedly   We were overcharged for internet use and for parking we didnt have a car  It took a long time for them to sort this out when we departed   Bar closed early on Memorial Day   we were told it was last call but then people apparently bartenders friends came in and were served Special IssueWe asked for a fridge and microwave because of a medical condition requiring preparing own food  They provided a fridge but the only outlet in which it coudl be plugged was controlled by a hall switch by the door  Even though we put a sign over the switch housekeeping kept turning it off  Hotel couldnt provide a microwave and told us that the Executive Floor was still under construction which it wasnt  My husband had to call them to come get his food and take it downstairs to be microwaved  Bit of a pain but in the future we know to find a hotel with a kitchette  
N => Live up to my expectations When I booked this hotel I had very high expectations I have already seen the pics on their web page and it simply looked fabulous  I have to say that The Blackstone didnt let me down  The rooms are cozy you feel at home  They really have made a good job of the reation  During our stay not everything went smoothly we had to move to another room because of some piping works  However we never felt something wrong with our room  Despite this little hitch my evaluation is  out of  I highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it  
N => Just OK You can tell they are cutting back  I know times are hard but when you charge  you expect fast service  Room service took way too long and I was late for my meeting  
N => Good if you like twin beds The hotel is beautiful  We were impressed until we got to the room and found out that the two beds we had requested were TWIN beds  I did not know any hotels had twin beds anymore  We should of been told that on the phone   We had three people in our party so we went down to desk and talked to quotLorenzoquot but he would not help us at all  
N => Lots of incredible history but overrated This hotel has incredible history and beautiful architecture but once youve seen all the magnificant common rooms lobby ballroom Palm Court old style elevators it isnt any different than any other overpriced  star historical hotel  Our friends were getting ried in the ballroom so we thought that we would take this opportunity to stay at The Drake since Im pregnant and it would be an easy escape for me to my room in the wee hours  Check in was at  and we were there on time as the wedding trolley was leaving at  and we needed time to get ready  At check in we were offered a deluxe upgrade on our king room but the hitch was that it wouldnt be ready for over an hour  Talk about dangling the carrot and yanking it away We couldnt wait an hour and considering check in wasnt until  I cant imagine why the room wasnt ready  We settled for our existing king reservation at  and found the room to be fine but of course our view was of the air conditioning units and we were next door to the Fitness area  So much for wedding party group booking bonus I cant imagine how much money our friends spent for their wedding at The Drake but Im sure they would have been mortified to hear about the rooms that their guests were given especially since they were quotpromisedquot that everyone under the group booking would be nicely taken care of  Pros   or was ent slightly dated but clean  room was ent size noise between roomsfloors was negligible  Bathroom was ok in size but only suitable for one person at a time  Cons   heating system was horribly loud had to turn it off at night to sleep no exhaust fan in bathroom wireless access was not free bottled water was   for a small bottle split of wine was over  breakfast was over  per person with another   kup for room service  There was coffee in the room but I wasnt sure if it was free and the room service menu said it was  so we popped over to Starbucks instead  Parking was ok at  a night if you use the public parking lot two doors down   you can even charge it to your room tab  We ended arriving a day early and didnt have a room booked  On Hotwire we found a  star hotel for  a night in the magnificant mile area  We werent getting in until  p m  so we werent that picky  The hotel ended up being the Holiday Inn Express  Of course for  our room overlooked the air conditioning units here as well but we had a very comfortable king bed huge plasma tv wonderfully orated room free breakfast free wireless and a great location  The room was super small   basically just enough room for the king bed and a really small bathroom but for the money it was so much more worth it than The Drake  The building was beautiful location was great personnel were very friendly self parking was around the corner  Ok theres no ballroom no Palm Court and Queen Elizabeth didnt stay here but does that really matter Save your money skip The Drake walk through it if you want to check it out but there are plenty of beautiful hotels in the magnificant mile area for alot less money 
N => Beautiful Hotel We had a good experience at the Drake  We got a good deal on Priceline but still got a newly updated room with  beds as we wanted  The place is still old doors carpet but all have character  The lobby is gorgeous We did not eatdrink there but there was a beautiful bar  Our only really bad experience was the concierge service they were not at all helpful or even pay attention to what you are asking  Expensive internet also Tips Take the river architecture tour wonderful  
N => Where theres smoke    For another  we splurged for the larger room when we checked in  We dropped our things and went to eatshop  After a long walk and fighting the crowds on Michigan Ave  we returned to the room just wanting to nap  No kids for the weekend so just pure quiet and personal freedom  Unfortunately when we returned to the room it stank of cigarette smoke  I pushed the call button for the front desk no answer  I called again impatient because of the exhaustion no answer  The third time was answered after a number of rings  I explained to the individual that the room smelled like smoke and that it was pretty nauseating  She told me to hold while she transferred me to the front desk  I must have rolled to another department  After explaining the predicament again the front desk asked what they could do  Not wanting to be a burden I asked for air freshener  They said they would send someone up  About  minutes later the smoke and the waiting was too much so I called again and asked for another room  They didnt have anything available until possibly  so they suggested we wait  hours until a room opened up  We couldnt bear the room so we sat in the lobby on quotgrandmas couchquot for about  minutes before realizing we wouldnt find any comfort there  We walked out of the hotel and saw a Bentley out front  It occurred to me perhaps why we were seemingly being ignored by the hotel  We gave the desk a cell   before we left and actually believed they would call it  But after miserably propping our heads up on a bar until  we still hadnt heard from them  There didnt seem to be much interest in making things right  When we returned to the front desk they apparently had a room available but had not called us no surprise  It was smaller than the previous room though must have still been worth the extra  since it was never refunded  We could hear people in the next room but they werent very loud so it wasnt an issue  Priily where the hotel erred was on the most basic elements  the things you take for granted  The things you would expect even from a Motel   The Homewood Suites we stayed at a few months before wasnt as fancy but it was much more reliable  
N => Huge Disappointment I was so excited about staying at The Drake you hear all of these wonderful things about it  The hotel itself is elegant and nice but our overall experience there was such a disappointment and definitely not worth night  Before even checking into our room they had already charged our credit card once for the entire bill without us even knowing  They charged us again when we checked in and AGAIN a week later after our stay  When we first walked into our room there was a roll out cot that we did not request standing in the middle of the entrance we could barely walk around it The room itself was tiny old and had a view of what looked like a dumpster  The toilet in the bathroom randomly made loud noises throughout the night  We could hear everything in the room next door to us  The hotel was quotbookedquot so we couldnt change rooms even if we wanted to  I also believe that because they were full they stuck a young couple like us in one of their shabbier rooms  There are PLENTY of other hotels in Chicago that are ten times nicer for the same price  Stay in one of them  
N => Fab Lake View This place does not dissapoint upgraded to a room with a view of the lake   amazing   Seems like there has been some refurbishment since the last time I was here   All and all   great 
N => Okay     The hotel was nice and very elegant  We booked a room on priceline and when we got there they had no standard rooms with two beds even though we requested so we had to upgrade  Not a great start but okay  The room was nice and spacious two closets and two bathrooms and two beds couch table etc  The location was pretty good being at the end of the Magnificent mile  We were two short blocks from Rush street great dining and close to State for Shopping  We also could walk down to the river in approximately  minutes  The barlounge was extremely over priced and the atmospher was that of a cheesy cruise ship lounge  We did not spend any time there  a tang  tonic was  I probably would not stay here again because you could just as easly stay in a holiday inn express with a better location and a good breakfast included  You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere  Not a disappointment exept that they didnt have a pool but not a great review either  I would recommend staying somewhere in the loop its still really nice but a little bit more centralized  
N => Never again    completely let down This was my second stay at the Drake  My husband and I had such a geat experience last year that we booked it again this year for a girls weekend  We booked a family suite through travelocity  We checked in at am but were told our room was not ready but they would call if it became available early they never called  We stored our luggage and went about our day  We officially got our room at pm  We stayed in room   Avoid this room at all costs First the room was musty and damp   very apparent when we entered the room  The carpet was constanty damp  There was mold on the shower curtains and the bathroom walls  The wallpaper and bed linens were stained and ripped  One of the lamps was broken  My friend got shocked when she attempted to turn it on not reallizing it was broken  The showers never worked right  The water came out hot from the faucet and cold from the showerhead   at the same time  Housekeeping NEVER came to our room  We had to call for towels  We called for a third time pm for towels and toilet paper the night before we left   this is when they ided to clean our room  We lined bc we were getting ready for bed dt an early flight The lady at the reception desk was very unfriendly ad refused to give me a receipt for the room bc we had a zero balance and had booked through travelocity  I did call management to express my dissatisfaction with the hotel and the service  I was told that they were quotsorryquot and we got and old room  We had previously loved the Drake but were left with such a sour taste for it  I will book somewhere else next time  
N => Typical grande dame hotel Gracious lovely semi restored grand hotel in a spectacular location near where Michigan Ave becomes Lake Shore Dr  Lobby is elegant Elevators are fast but small and there is no indicating light to indicate which of the  has arrived at ones floor until the door opens  My guest room door did not properly close and I had to pull or shove it closed  Room was spacious and the window even opened a few inches   velous The bed was wonderful but there was a small refrigerator plopped in the room   useful  and appreciated but rather unsightly  I n a hotel of this caliber it should appear to be quotbuilt inquot rather than freestanding  Staff was pleasant and helpful for my  day visit  
N => Pleasantly surprised Just returned from a   day convention at The Drake amp was pleasantly surprised by its classic elegance  Our th floor room was spacious amp comfortable  The bathroom location provided lots of privacy  The banquet food served to several hundred of us Friday night through Sunday brunch was some of the tastiest Ive enjoyed in some time  Our servers did an excellent job The place was very quiet considering the Air amp Water Show was just outside  The elevators were somewhat small but prompt  Their narrow doors werent very forgiving if you got in their way  Built in  there are lots of stairs in some areas  Expression by Lavazza on the ground level serves great Italian coffee sandwiches amp ice cream Oak Street beach is a short walk away  I hope to be able to stay at the Drake again  
N => Its Nice and Famous and has a Fantastic location but otherwise just ok I was excited to stay at the Drake because Id heard so much about it  And true it has an amazing location and it is very nice  Its just not qutie as nice as I expected  The reservation process was annoying  First the hotel made an error on my reservation and then the hotel did absolutely nothing to correct the mistake  Then I requested early check in and wasnt told that Id have to pay a  fee to check in at noon and so I booked a flight to arrive at the hotel at noon and then was told about the fee  I would have liked to have known that when I requested early check in   just good info to be aware of and in general I felt that the hotel was very unresponsive to problems My room was a bit old  It was a good sized room although I did hear there were some tiny rooms  The bathroom had been updated but Im thinking it  have happened in the late s or early s  So it had granite and was a ecnt size but the bathtub was no nicer than any economy hotel and the flush on the toilet was on the wall and looked like a public restroom flush  The bed was qutie nice   nothing blew me away but it was nice No robes no slippers  Nothing else to signify quotluxury hotel quotRoom service seemed even pricier than one could expect and mediocre  Ditto for the bar where I went to lunch one day There is a business center but it cost me  to spend  minutes on the computer to print  pages  Just ridiculous to charge that kind of money considering how much guests spend to stay and dine at the Drake  I know many hotels that arent specifically for business travelers charge fees at the business center but it just comes across as petty  My view of the lake and the city was phenomenal though and the location really is spectacular I wouldnt recommend the Drake to a friend because I think there are betternicercheaper hotels in Chicago but if my friend was intent on staying at the Drake I certainly wouldnt discourage himher  
N => great historic hotel in a great location This was a wonderful hotel The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable The location at the beginning of the magnificent mile was perfect  We were able to walk everywhere  This hotel was everything we hoped it to be We ate at Gibsons and it was the best steak we ever had 
N => Avoid The Chicago Drake Dont spend money at the Drake  The place is classic   but nothing rekable  Just a rickety old building held together by the thick layers of paint  But that is not the warning   it is the staff  They will charge you a lot for anything they can and will not budge on anything in return  Read the other reviews here  In our case out of   persons there for a meeting along with rented ballroom two had reservations accidentally made for  days instead of two  Immediately the desk staff pointed to the fine print on the form stating it was a quotcontractquot and they had to charge full day rate as an early departure fee  One person was able to get this retracted by the second day  The other was lied to by Assistant Director Tom shall and told nobody was given a break  Tom refused to talk to the compd person and threatened to call security  Ill make sure my corporation is aware of this place  
N => Disappointing I was so excited when i knew that our bid landed on The Drake  My expectations went through the roof given its reputation  When we first arrived I was impressed with the nice lobby and grande ambiance in the lounge  But once we stepped inside the rooms our feelings turned into disappointment  The room was very small  The twin beds were comfortable but also very small  The bathroom was outdated  Cleanliness level was subpar  The minibar was dirty  No wireless connection in rooms Given its pricey rooms one would expect more of this hotel  I had to extend my trip in Chicago but looked for another hotel to stay in  
N => worst hotel service My husband and I dined in their cocktail room Coq dOr  Beware of the bar tender he will slip in more drinks in the check without you noticed and the manager just think you are an idiot and lied to your face  
N => Couldve been okay but turned out terribly  Ill start with the good things The bed was very comfortable  The room was very clean  The bathtub was outdated but large  The lobby was beautiful and the bar was good And now the bad The room was a shoebox and based on the floorplan stuck to the bathroom wall fire routes it was easy to see we had the smallest room on the floor  We asked for  King bed and got  Queen bed  The bed had only a fitted sheet and a duvet   no top sheet no blanket  Fortunately we managed to find a bag in the closet containing the missing sheet and blanket  Unfortunately we really didnt need it as the thermostat seemed to be broken and the room was sweltering all night  After supposedly having it fixed for our second night I once again woke up in the middle of the night and had to go sit in the hallway to cool down  We also requested early check in if available and while I didnt mind the  fee for this it would have been nice to know in advanced when I requested it instead of being notified upon check in  
N => It pains me to write this review We dont usually stay in the Gold Coast area when we are in Chicago and it has been many years since I have been to the Drake to stay  I had such fond memories and I guess I should have kept it that way  The hotel still has bits of its former glory that you can see through the slow ay  All the beautiful crown molding is still there and the lobby is as impressive as ever the rooms are where the age becomes evident  Hilton has done work to the hotel and continues to do so but they are not going to win the battle with out a major overhaul  Our room was a Gold coast suite with  rooms the average nightly cost for this room is   Amenities in that room include quite a few things we never had some simple some pretty major no bolster pillow no complimentary beverage no large arm chair with Ottoman no turndown service at night and no newspaper  There is a work area in the suites as well however there are no light bulbs anywhere in the rooms over  watts so its hard to read anything  The hotel was also noisy the doors are heavy and close hard so every time someone came or left we heard doors slamming  The staff used to be very accommodating but now they are all rather aloof with the exceptions of the maids that stand and chat in the hallways they always said hello  Our suite had a bathroom with or out of the s and shower mold that appears to have started in the s it was so thick  There was also a pop spill all down the wall by our mini fridge that was there when we checked in and was not cleaned up during our whole week stay  The bedroom of the suite and the bathroom also had the distinct smell of vomit which made me have to go buy a strong candle to keep in the room  I was so very disappointed we will not be back to stay in the hotel again  I would recommend the restaurants however they are wonderful  
N => Never again First the hotel gladly booked my room at a discounted rate and billed my credit card for   of the stay prior to our arrival  Btw our discounted rate was  per night I now know why they do this  When you arrive and chose to leave due to problems you lose all of your money  Their rate of early departures has to be very high given all the problems we experienced  What problems you  ask Our bathroom had black mold on the ceiling  The ceiling in the main room was cracked from the ceiling light fixture all the back to the frame of the wallceiling  Every time we open or shut the door to our room plaster fell on our bed  The carpet was GROSS to the point that we asked for another room due to the mold smell  We were refused another room  There were no coffee mugs  I called at AM for a mug and it did not arrive til afternoon the handle was broken  At PM I asked for a CLEAN robe to no avail  I called the front desk at midnight to advise that I had yet to receive a clean robe  Boy they were quick They brought a roll away bed  HUH We were in the gym and asked for extra head sets since there were none on the rack  Again to no avail  They later explained that they no longer provide head sets due to sanitary concerns  Gee if they applied the same concern toward their hotel rooms they would not have a black mold problem  If you want to eat breakfast via room service be prepared to wait all morning  We placed our breakfast order for early delivery AM  When it finally arrived at  AM nothing on our plates resembled anything we had ordered  Two bagels on a plate and a bowl of fruit    Huh We spoke with the weekend general manager who stated that there was nothing he could do to adjust our bill because we had pre paid  He gave us four complimentary meal vouchers good for use in their fine dining facility  This was on our last day What were we going to do with complementary meal vouchers on our last day  They are invalid the day you depart  If you valet your car they tell you to call   minutes prior to pick up in the event they are busy  They were We waited  minutes and barely cht our flight out of Chicago  For all those folks who rated this hotel a quotquot  I can only assume you are accustomed to staying at  star hotels  The hotel is filthy and is in need of a MAJOR face lift  Also I am fluent in spanish while teaching foreign languages for  years and I still had a difficult time communicating with their spanish speaking staff  
N => Family time at the Drake We checked in at around noon on a Sunday and our room was not available it was  queen and two Murphy twin beds I asked the women at check in if she could find us another room since we were only in Chicago for  hours and we had touring plans and wanted to get into a room  They put us into an upgraded roomsuite with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa and two bathrooms for the same price  It was wonderful ore is a bit dated but very clean and old world elegant  The Concierge was wonderful  She recommeneded a wonderful Architectural boat cruise very worthwhile and an amazing Itialian restaurant Volare a few blocks off of Michigan Ave  Overall our stay was memorable  However we found it rediculous and even hard to believe that we could not get wirleless access for our laptop at the Drake wout paying a fee even in the public areas  Two and three star hotels offer it for free  The Drake is a slpurge if not on a business account and extra fees are insulting The other thing that was not favoraable was that the heat in our room could not be regulated and we roasted all night    very uncomfortable and a total waste of energy and money by the hotel  
N => Classic but needs an update I stayed at the Drake recently because it was very close to a customer account  I have heard great things about the Drake in the past and the fact that it was priced within my companys frugal allowance sealed the deal  I arrived late at night but the lobby was very elegant and well appointed  Check in was a breeze and I board the old elevator to my rd floor room  Upon walking in two things crossed my mind it was a generously sized room and I have not seen a  inch TV outside of a yard sale in some time The details are rough around the edges  Wallpaper was peeling paint was chipped tile grout was loose sink stopper floating around  The bed was new and the shower was a big walk in type  The Drake Bros restaurant serves breakfast and my Hilton Gold membership comped the normally   buffet  It was good but not  good I find that these things are overpriced to begin with and downtown Chicago is obviously no exception  Overall its a ent hotel for what my company paid  There are better hotels in the area for only slightly more money however  
N => Save your money We found The Drake Hotel a huge disappointment  We reserved the executive floor  We were given another  After going back down to the desk   they gave us our reserved room  It was very noisy inside and out  Our second night we had to call down and ask for shampoo and soap  The next morning we had to call down and ask for coffee cups which were there for us the first night  We waited  minutes for the cups  Actually the housekeepers wanted to clean our room and we told them that we were not ready and were still waiting for our cups  They brought them within a couple of minutes  Twenty minutes later as we were leaving the coffee cups became available from another unit of the hotel  The bed was nice but there was no sheet between the comforter  We found this odd as others have shown  The staff at the downstairs bar seemed extremely rude  We will not be going back to The Drake  There are too many other Grand Hotels in Chicago  
N => another disappointing stay at the Drake I wanted to like the hotel but the condition of the room doesnt match the cost of staying here  Sofa had holes lampshade had burn ks torn wallpaper worn carpet  unfriendly and uncooperative and unprofessional appearance from the staff  would not even consider a late check out  the bathroom was not clean when we checked in  and during our visit the bathroom was not clean  
N => Uninspriring view from window but what a bed D I was in Chicago on business so had to book a hotel that was on the approved list  I was advised to book The Drake by a colleague   the tripadvisor reviews were largely good so I wasnt too bothered My room was a good size but there was no upgrade to a suite oh well My only negative comments would be that the room is fairly dark even with all curtains open during the day or all lights on at night the wardrobe is quite small and I did notice noise from the room next door talking on telephone alarm clock in the moring etc On the plus side the bed has got to be the best I have ever slept in and was so comfortable  The coffee machine in the room makes very acceptable coffee and the shower worked fine Old fashioned or was not to my taste but was in good order Good location and I even had oblique views of the lake from my room 
N => Interesting hotel lack of attention to detail This hotel was booked by Hilton Honors  I am a Diamond Member  The lakeview room with twin beds and sitting area was delivered as promised  It was a nice room with excellent view  Good location adjacent to the Magnificent Mile and not too far from Navy Pier The hotel clerk booking us in appeared not to understand the reservation which for some reason was made for two nights on arate certificates  This was subsequently confirmed when I received a whopping bill after my first nights stay  This was reviewed by the hotel desk and I was assured that charges had been reversed and balance was quotquot  On checkout the following day I again asked and was assured there were no charges  I today discovered the charges on my credit card  The Drake promised to remove them but it would take a week  They could not print out a receipt on checkout as I had quotquot charges  Newspaper was not delivered to room in morning  The Executive lounge requires agility to climb approximately  stairs  When I asked about disabled guests I was informed by a staff member that he had asked the same thing when he arrived at the hotel  No real answerThis hotel is expensive and has magnificent lobby elevators and good rooms  However it lacks enthusiasm towards guests and does not seem to care if you are pleased or rankled  I liked the location but not the attitude  I would not stay here if I had to pay  a night  
N => Disappointing Last month  high school friends and I met in Chicago for a brief mini reunion  We arrived before the  check in time and were told our room wasnt ready yet but would be soon  We waited and waited and still our room wasnt ready  After an hour I requested that the hotel treat us to tea while we waited  We were told we could have cups of tea no extras  Finally at  we were given keys to our room and told that our bags had been sent up  We went up to the room only to discover that our keys did not work  When we returned to the desk the woman said one of our cell phones had probably demagnetized the keys  The keys had never been near our cell phones  We went back up to our room and discovered our bags had not been sent up and we had to call to have them sent up  That night I called to check that I could get my car at  the following morning  I was told to call   minutes before I needed the car  The next morning I called and no one answered and I had to leave a voice mail  I called a little bit later and still no one answered  When I went down to get my car it was not there and clearly the man in charge of the cars had not received my message  I ended up leaving The Drake about  minutes after my intended departure  After our stay I filled out a customer survey and described the events of our stay  Ive waited a month and have not heard anything back from The Drake  Admittedly no one problem was awful but when you add them all up it makes for less than a perfect stay  Errors happen but a truly fine hotel apologizes and takes responsibility for their mistakes  The Drake  once have been a  diamond hotel but today only their rates make you think  diamonds  
N => Perfect Weekend Getaway We chose this hotel because there was an online special from hotels com  What a surprise to find such a fabulous hotel with character and elegance for such a small price  Our room was on the th floor which we were told had been recently reated  It was very nicely furnished and had a large flat screen television  There was a walk in closet with a safe and thick bathrobes inside  The bathroom was spotless with ble floors and a large bathshower  All the staff we encountered could not have been more helpful or friendly  The only thing we could possibly find fault with was the bed  It was really hard  Of course if you like a firm mattress that would be a plus 
N => If you want to splurge    What a gorgeous hotel We love places with a story amp try to stay at member hotels of the Historic Hotels of America  The Drake lives up to its reputation  From the building itself the linens the service to the couch in the elevator everything was beautiful  The hotel thankfully was up to our cleanliness standards  Weve found sometimes the older hotels need to be updated but the Drake is not one of them  The only negative was the price  Our room was almost  per night including taxes  If we hadnt had a free night with our Hilton reward we would not have stayed there  Hopefully well be able to stay there again  
N => A Grande Dame that needs to get with the times I stayed at the Drake last week for a conference  I went there with certain expectations as I had stayed at a modern near by property a few weeks earlier  Although I had confirmed by Hilton preferences in advance the first room they tried to stick me in was on a low floor  The second room was a smoking room that was the size of a closet  The last room I finally got was perfectly adequate but needed some updating  The bed was not very comfortable especially compared to the hotel down the street  The bathroom was small  The TV was old and only had a small selection of stations  I am a federal government employee and I checked in with a tax exempt form  Not only did they not know what to do with it when they finally figured it out I was still billed incorrectly and had to get it straightened out  Hey I wanted to save the taxpayers some money but what a painAs for the conference facilities themselves the rooms were tiny and hot even though outside it was in the s while we were there  After the sessions ended the wait for the elevators was ridiculous  The other ridiculous wait was for the ladies room when the sessions broke  With all the choices of hotels in Chicago I would definitely look at other options when I return  There was nothing compelling   the room the staff or the location    that would make me want to stay there again  
N => Was disappointed  but loved the city  Just returned from a weekend stay  Place is beautiful but they dont give much care about housekeeping in the rooms  I was so surprised when I first went into the bathroom it looked like someone just put clean towels but left everything else  There was a USED bar of soap I picked up the rubber mat to take a shower and there was someone elses hair  yuk      There housekeeping is really bad  I have traveled and stayed in many places management should inspect the room before giving it to someone  I think a clean room is basic  A lot of small things also         we spoke to head of reservations to RESERVE a lake view reservation was done awhile before our visit  We get to the Hotel at  noon and they did not have  rooms as we requested and booked  They did not even give a reason it was like we never reserved a room so it doesnt even pay to talk to reservation manager to insure your booking is what you need      Something that bothered me was after the first morning we used the coffee pot and that day they supposedly cleaned room but did not refill coffee bagssugar creamers etc  for following day  It must be a management problem next time I will spend a little more money and go to another hotel  Great things was location and buffet in morning  Loved the food  
N => Nice but somehow disappointing Stayed at the Drake    cant quite put my finger on it but I was disappointed  Perhaps its because we didnt stay in a night room but I was expecting quotmorequot from my night room  It was clean and comfortable but small  Nothing I can complain about after all it did have a view of Oak Street Beach and the lake  And it snowed while we were there so it was quite picturesque  
N => Wonderful Hotel My husband amp I stayed at the Drake hotel for an anniversary get away this past weekend  We booked and paid for a king room two weeks before our arrival  We received a free upgrade to an executive suite upon checkin  Our room number  the Churchill Suite was enormous with great views of both the lake and the city  The room was clean amp the bed was comfortable  The bathroom was spacious with an ok bathtub amp a nice erate shower  We had no complaints with the room amp would highly recommend spending the extra  to get a suite at this hotel  The hotel itself is beautiful  The hotel staff was courteous amp helpful from check in to check out  Valet was very prompt upon check in but a little unorganized when we checked out  Things to definitly do at this hotel Sunday brunch at the Drake Bros  restaurant  Pricey but well worth the   Entertainment in the Palm Court on Saturday evening  They had a jazz group there the night we stayed amp they were very good  Check out the shops on the lower level of the hotel before heading out to Michigan Ave  Things to skipIf you dont like tight crowded spaces   skip dining in the Cape Cod restaurant The Saturday night lines can be long waiting for the hotel staff to get a cab for you  Take the  minute walk to the end of the block amp you will be in a cab much quicker than waiting in front of the hotel  If you do have access to the Executive Lounge dont bother  This was the only thing we were dissapointed with  It had the exact same view that we had in our suite  There was a very small bar with a bartender that was not as friendly as the bartenders in other parts of the hotel  They have a free breakfast in the lounge but we opted for room service after our experience in there the evening before  
N => Never again We stayed at the Drake hotel over Thanksgiving and we did not like it at all  Not only did we have a smelly room the smell   from a room deodorant made us sick but the room rate   for a standard room on the first floor with no view at all was outrageous compared to other hotels in the same category where we stayed before  And for breakfast we had to pay extraThank you never again  
N => Very nice but wouldnt pay the advertised price My husband and I spent two nights at the Drake at the end of our Chicago stay  We were fortunate to receive an employee rate which brought the room under  which is excellent for any Chicago area property let alone a landk  The hotel is attractive  Our check in was easy and we were treated well despite paying less for our room  Yes the hotel is old but it is by no means falling apart  Our room was well appointed and well orated  Our bathroom door did not shut perfectly due to age but who cares  We were greeted with a variety of fresh berries and a berry tart presented attractively in our room  The hotel has a good location close to the lake and close to shopping  It is not close to a Metro station  We made the mistake of schlepping our luggage down MI avenue to the hotel and it was a long walkThe beds were comfortable and I thought the bathrooms were beautiful  We did not eat at the hotel  Our carpet showed some signs of wear  All in all I was very happy to have stayed at such a famous hotel and there were no problems at all with our stay  To be honest we spent very little time in the room  We took the Architecural Societys boat tour which was wonderful  I wouldnt recommend wasting to much time with Navy Pier  very touristy and crowded with no place to eat  The Shakespeare company was good though  We enjoyed Millenium Park  I had been there for the grand opening and it was just as good and less crowded than I had remembered  We stayed outside of the city for a week as my husband had business and I was able to visit the botannical gardens which are not to be missed  This is a huge garden and it is magnificent  There is an excellent outdoor train portion as well  
N => Pay full price and you will be treated well The Drake is a nice location in Chicago though needs some work inside  We booked through Priceline and thank the Lord we did  I cant imagine paying anymore than  a night for that dump  However when you book through a discount hotelier be prepared to be treated like crap The valet guys were great   but then again they didnt know we didnt pay to full  full price a night  We asked to get  double beds and not a King because we had  small children and they refused to do that even though most hotels will do that simple change with Priceline patrons  They claimed none of the rooms in our group would accomodate more than  people even with an airbed but my sister got a large corner unit that would havealso booked on Priceline for   They lied    We booked  rooms there for the weekend because we had a wedding in town  I ended up quotsellingquot my unit to a relative and got an even better room via Priceline at the Westin River Northsee that review  Dont waste your time or your money at The Drake 
N => Old and Unsatisfactory We checked in very late at night we had called ahead to tell them and when we got up to our room it was a very smelly smoking room with dirty carpet and paint peeling on the walls  The front desk did not let us know when we arrived it was smoking and then told us it was the only room available when we called down to change it  They did move us in the morning we had to request again ourselves but the room they moved us to also had dirty carpeting and paint peeling off the walls  You can tell what this hotel was once but it is really worn out now  badly needs a face lift  On the positive the bed was nice and fluffy  
N => Hilton Honors members treated llike nd class citizens We just returned from a  night stay at the Drake   nights were using Hilton Honors rewards points and we added  night at our own expense  If you think the Drake loves their Hilton Honors member you will be sadly disappointed  Judging by the reviews and photos posted on this site we know that the Drake treats their Priceline customers better Read on Upon check in we learned we would have to move after the first  nights because we had booked our extra night in a different category of room than the room booked using our Hilton Honors points we politely asked if we might be assigned to one room for our entire stay but were told no  Our st room was on the th floor off a very small corridor next to a fire escape  In fact the fire escape platform was literally attached to our window  We also had a view of the mechanical system but nothing else  The room itself was very tiny and the carpet in the room was badly stained and soiled  There was mold growing around the shower bar and soap dish and the tile grout looked like it needed some scrubbing  There was some fresh fruit and chocolate in the room to welcome us and since we knew the hotel was fully booked for the evening we settled in  The first evening I hardly slept at all due to the air conditioner  It was a warm evening and every time the air conditioner fan turned off there was a loud Bang It literally made me jump out of bed a couple of times during the night  I finally turned off the fan altogether and slept awhile  At am I called the front desk and asked for a new room or to have the maintenance people fix the AC  No offer for a new room but maintenance did arrive within minutes and fixed the banging AC  We also asked for a morning paper theres a note in the room saying one can be requested but never received one once while we stayed in the st room  Fresh towels arrived one evening long after we had requested them and long after I had wandered the halls to find them myself  Believe me we felt pretty invisible and ignored Kind of Harry Potter ish  On the rd day we were required to pack up all our belongings so that we could be moved to the room we had booked for our final evening  When we returned to the hotel that evening our bags had been moved to a large and lovely lakeview room  The carpet was clean the bathroom was clean  There was no comparison between the rooms in fact at the moment we walked in to the nd room we realized how truly awful the first room was  And to think that we used a bundle of Honors points on a room that should not have been given to anyone On the third day we were also told about the amenities available to Hiltons Honors members although that information had not been shared previously  It was like all of a sudden they realized we were Diamond members  Too little too late  On a better note we had breakfast in the hotel and it was wonderful  The maintenance people were prompt and efficient in fixing the AC problem when they were notified  The maids were friendly and polite  The concierge was helpful and gave good directions and suggestions  But if you want to feel pampered and safe and valued as a customer find another hotel  
N => Everything a hotel should be  From start to finish this hotel exceeded all my expectations  Having stayed here previously I knew that I was getting a good deal The Drake is elegant and has one of the most professional staffs out there  From the GM down to the doorman this hotel will take care of you Upon arriving I was upgraded to the executive floor  The room had a great view of the lake shore and was extremely well appointed and comfortable  From the fine carpeting to the digital bathroom scale the room was well thought out After going for a stroll I came back to the room to find a small surprise  The ice bucket had been filled by the staff and a refreshment had been chilled for me while I was out  They had even set out some fresh fruit and berries for me to munch on  The GMs card was left as well with a note to give him a call for any issue that might arise  This hotel was greatness  
N => Good but unfortunately not great We got the room on Priceline as part of a romantic getaway weekend and was happy we got the Drake but were weary that the hotel  have been past its prime  It  be  We were given a room facing the HVAC system and which featured a size quotfullquot bed or something smaller than our bedroom at home  We think the room could have fita king size  The room was clean and the bathroom was well appointed though the shower head hit we at the shoulders I am quot and was difficult to manipulate  The room did seem stuffy and the thermostat never seemed to get to the temperature we were set at The service we encountered was all good and the common areas are beautiful  Room service though pricey was quick and when they brought the wrong thing corrected their mistake even quicker  
N => Nice    We stayed in a single room with king size bed on the back side of the building facing another building  However if you looked out the window to the left you can see Lake MichiganThe bed was very comfortable and the shower was very nice  However I was a little disappointed that for  a night   I had shell out  for bottle water if I wanted it I have been to other hotels that give complementary water when at this price range  As elegant as the room was it was stuffy and little warm  We had our own thermostat and had it set to  but it did not feel as it was set on  Location of this hotel is great Near the shopping and the beach with plenty of activities to do in the area  Would I return to the hotel Yes Recommend it to friends Yes  
N => Dont Pass This One Up if you like the Ambiance of Years Gone By We spent  nights at the Drake in room  partial lake viewvia Priceline  If I could be sure that every Priceline Bid wouldbe at a place like the Drake I wouldnt hesitate to do it everytime  Since this was my first Priceline experience Illstill be cautious  Anyway The Drake was superb  Our roomwas spacious check in was expeditious room service wasprompt with good food but expensive as you might expect The room was made up promptly each day  We did not optfor the evening turn down which you must request  Gettingback to the room even comparing to more modern hotels itwas quite large and in great shape  The bed was extremelycomfortable The bathrooom was large and we had a foyerwith a very large closet   My wife opted to have High Tea inthe Palm room  I opted to have a very good tini  It was anexperience that every couple should share   An excellent Harpplayer all the opulence of days gone by  very good serviceand the finger sandwiches were not all bad particularyly with a good tinii  Since we rented a car on our last day inChicago we had the pleasure of using Valet Parking at thetune of   per day but I must say they were prompt inpicking up and retrieving our car  All in all The Drake is anexperience to enjoy in an excellent location on Michigan AVe at the beginning of the quotMiracle Milequot  We travel to Chicagoevery couple years and wed do The Drake again withouthesitation  
N => Not what I expected for the name Came for some Magnificent Mile time was a beautiful lobby of course location was ent my corporate discount was amazing and the views were gorgeous  Room was horribly small AC unit was too loud to sleep and staff was slow I think they cared too much about their name and not enough about today  I would have been really upset if I paid close to the regular rate  
N => VERY faded glory Old rooms bad service elevators that were so slow and antiquated that you practically aged standing waiting for them dirty bathroom and especially the toilet   asked  times to have it cleaned but to no avail  Noisy air con system dirty floors     generally just really bad and not a pleasure at all to be staying there   You need a face lift Drake 
N => Disappointment Saw reviews and was very excited to go to the Drake Positives Good Location Quick check in easy check out Negative   Very Expensive paid  for  nights  Thin walls   You can hear other peoples showers people in their bathrooms  Our room was next to the storage room   so we constantly heard a door open and shut  our room was very small  I have had a bigger room at a Best Western or a riott Misleading information on their website  Their website says they have the internet but when you log on you find out that they charge  to your room who charges for the internet  Can only use the gym for a fee  again who charges for a gym None of the hotel staff spoke to us 
N => What a treat What more could you want when waking up in Chicago than to look out your window at Oak Street Beach and Lake Michigan Our room a ior suite was wonderfully large and furnished nicely  The bed was heavenly to sleep on and I wanted to take the pillows home with me  The only complaint was a very slow draining bathtubshower  The Crabtree amp Evelyn toiletries were a nice amenity  Staying at The Drake is like stepping back in time to a grander more genteel way of life  While we were there we read where the hotel had been sold but would still be managed by Hilton properties  The ior suite entitled us to the Concierge floor where we enjoyed a nice continental breakfast each morning overlooking Lake Michigan  The service was excellent on all levels  They just dont make wonderful hotels like this one anymore  
N => Amazing The largest rooms of any hotel ever Amazing service perfect location   worth every penny 
N => Disappointing Drake My husband and I stayed here over Easter weekend also our anniversary using our Hilton Honors points    chose the hotel for the ambiance history and charm  Unfortunately our experience was not what we hoped or expected  When asked for suggestions for brunch the concierge produced a clipping from the Tribune I prefer personal recommendations anyone can read the Tribune the bathtub caulk was moldy our air conditioner broke twice and no turndown service was provided even though requested  Also the walls were so paper thin we heard our neighbors VERY clearly especially on Easter morning when the neighbor kids got up at  a m  to search for Easter Eggs in their room While not a horrible experience it certainly wasnt what I expected from a stay at the famed quotDrake quot 
N => Drake the snake Having worked in Chicago years ago I was really looking forward to returning  However my experience at the Drake was less than satisfactory  We arrived on th Valentines day to be greeted by a very unfriendly check in staff member    When I booked the website mentioned that there was a pool      there wasnt any pool in the hotel at all   instead one accross the road   We booked bounceback rate which included a buffet breakfast    guess what   there wasnt any buffet breakfast during the week at all   only at weekends   Overall the staff were aloof and unsympathetic to our concerns Will not be returning to the Drake  
N => Beautiful Historic  My fiancee and I stayed   the Drake Hotel back in ch of   It was beautiful and comfortable  We  have even conceived our son there We stayed in the executive suite so we had a rather large room  I believe we paid day and it was worth every penny  We will definitely return 
N => Bring earplugs What a disappointment for the price Our room was on the quotexecutivequot level had a great view but was very small  Like others have mentioned the bed has only a thick comforter    no sheets or other blankets    so youre either sweating under the comforter or freezing without it  The worst was the noise    every time someone came in or out of a room on our hall we could hear the door slam  Every time someone got ice the ice machine is stupidly located right in the hall not in an enclosed room to block the noise we could hear it  At about  p m  the people next to us started having a party  They were smoking even though it was a non smoking floor    we could smell the smoke in our room  We called the front desk to complain and were assured Security would come up to confront the partiers but no one ever came  We complained about the noise from the doors and ice machine at the same time and were told basically quotHey be glad youre not closer to the street because thats even noisier quot The partiers left around  we were up till midnight waiting for the assistant manager to call us back as he claimed he would he never did but they returned around  a m  and started their party again  We called to complain again and got nothing from the front desk except   off our room and an upgrade for the next time we stay next time    yeah right It seems like there are easy fixes they could make to reduce noise but they have not chosen to do that  The staff we complained to said all the right things but didnt follow through on doing what they said they would  Its ridiculous that they allow people to flaunt the quotno smokingquot rule Aside from that we had access to the executive club on the upper level with free hors doeuvres and open bar in the evenings and free buffet breakfast in the mornings  It got very crowded and very loud so it was not pleasant to sit there    we ended up taking food back to our room  They were not very good about replenishing food on the buffet either  We paid extra to have access to this amenity so it was disappointing to not be able to use it fully We ate at the Cape Cod Room in the hotel    the food was quite good but the or is very tacky and not consistent with the high prices  Its also very loud and the tables are rather close together  Its a seafood restaurant but you can order from the menu from the hotels steakhouse as well  They were very nice about letting us take our desserts up to our rooms giving us real utensils and dishes All in all this was an extremely disappointing experience  For the price you have to pay you should at least be able to get a comfortable nights sleep and be assured that a no smoking floor is truly non smoking  
N => Very good Great clean room  Disappointing breakfast in hotel restaraunt  Get a room up high or noise can be a bother  
N => Sad disappointment The Drake has such a venerable history that my husband and I didnt consider staying anywhere else for our first visit to Chicago  We paid  with taxes for a small room that looked at a wall  Whatever we werent planning on spending all our time in the room  However the doorknob came off when we closed the door  The light in closet wouldnt shut off shining into the room all night long  And there were no washclothes in the bathroom  When we asked for some we were given one as if they were being rationed  Oh and the TV had poor reception  The doorknob and closet light were eventually fixed The real problem occured when we came home near midnight to find our room flooded with water  The woman next door had fallen asleep while running a bath and that water seeped into our room soaking the carpet and many of our belongings  This isnt the hotels fault    I get that  However their response afterwards was pathetic  They told us theyd move us to a new room and send up a bellman right away to help  After a half hour no one had arrived and we were told he was too busy to help us  We went to the front desk to obtain the key to our new room dragged all of our bags there and then found the key didnt work  Back down to the front desk where we were told it would take at least a half hour to resolve the problem  It wasnt until I pointed out to the clerk that it was  am we were paying  a night and had nowhere to sleep and this was upsetting that she magically found another room for us  Its sad that a beautiful old hotel with the Drakes reputation could sink to such low standards  
N => Outstanding Service Plus a Wonderful Hotel   A My husband cousin and I stayed at the Drake in Chicago for a week  From the moment we arrived the staff was over the top The bell hop assisted us immediately  We checked in early so our room was not available but the staff graciously offered to hold our luggage if we wanted to get out to our shopping We arrived back and found our room to be something out of the s with moden day accessories  We were skeptical of the carpet since we had read all the reviews about the horrible carpet but it wasnt so bad  It could be replaced sometime but you really dont notice it  The room was orated nicely but because it is an old hotel and was very humid during our trip the doors sort of stuck because of the wood expanding  The beds were very comfortable even the roll away for my cousin  The service was outstanding We had turn down service every night and even got a chocolate chip cookie for my cousin who is   The room was always cleaned as promised  We only had to ask once for extra towels after that housekeeping made sure we had enough towels each day We did have to call maintenance once to get our refrigerator door shut  They were very prompt and attended to the problem ASAP  They were dressed in their uniforms and were very clean cut  We were impressed I cannot rave enough about the concierge service  You tell them your going somewhere and immediately they hand you a coupon book of deals and free bees They were very organized and helped us handle a few side trips while we were visiting  Last but not least my husband ordered me flowers from the floral shop in the hotel  They came just as we got to our room and were a beautiful assortment  I loved the colors and the size of the roses about  quot each rose I expected them to only live a few days but instead they lasted all week  What a wonderful surprise and a great deal since they didnt die the next dayOverall I would say our experience was top notch  We love staying downtown in Chicago and I think weve found our new home 
N => Nice hotel but dirty carpet My room was large and grand but the carpet was dirty in the room  The service was great and bed was comfortable  But bathroom and carpet could use some work  Wont stay here again  
N => old fashined elegance we visited from scotland over memorial weekend and stayed in the hotel for  nights  we had an executive room overlooking the lake on the th floor  room was a good size hubby loved the lay out of the mini bar more like a little cocktail bar disappointed the windows did not open as was advertised window screens made the windows appear to be dirty  carpet in room was well past its best and appreciated the bathroom slippers as i did not like the idea of walking barefoot on it lovely old hotel much better than a quotchainquot hotel  enjoyed the coq dor bar were lovely food is served  staff all very pleasant  access to executive lounge on the th floor well worth the extra cost they mixed a mean cocktail  staff there got to know you and were pleased to have you pop in for a pre dinner apperitif  amazing views over the lake give this hotel a big plus factor would certainly recommend this hotel for its old fashioned image and interesting history  
N => Classic Hotel We stayed at the Drake over Memorial Day weekend and thought it was a nice hotel  The location was excellent  The Oak Street Beach was just across the street and of course it was great being at the start of the Magnificent Mile shopping strip  The view was nice from our room   we had a lake view room on the th floor  The staff was friendly enough   especially the bell hops and valets  The concierge was very friendly and helpful also We felt the room size was much larger than most chain hotels but like other visitors we did notice chipped furniture wornout carpet and a worn bedspread  We also had a slight problem with room cleaniness   when we checked in we realized that someone had used the toilet and didnt even flush That was unpleasant but being so late we just didnt really have the strength to complain and change rooms   though we probably should have  The only other problem we had was strange noises in the hallway which we realized was due to a service elevator being across from our room  The noises did not happen during the night so its not like it kept us awake  Other than that the shower could use some updating   we started running out of hot water after only  showers  We didnt try any of the restaurants located at the Drake so can not comment on those  Obviously there is plenty of other restaurants in the area within walking distance I dont mean for this to sound like a terrible review   we really did have a pleasant stay  I think one has to realize that this is an older hotel and appreciate its historical value and classic beauty  
N => Major disappointment We checked into the Drake the last weekend of ch  It was one negative experience after another  Check in person was cold to say the least  Seemed very bored and unwelcoming When we got to our room we found that it had not been fully cleaned  The bed was made and surfaces were clean however when we went to the mini bar it was dirty and had to been restocked  There were black hand prints on all the doors and stains everywhere  The room was also freezing cold but the thermostat was not working so we called down to reception and asked for the room to be cleaned and the temperature to be adjusted  An hour later plus three phonecalls someone finally came up  Room was cleaned but apparently nothing could be done about the heating  It had just been switched on and we were told it would take approximately an hour for our room to heat up The final straw was when the people in the room next of us arrived  They  as well have been sitting in our room we could hear absolutely everything word for word Overall a very disappointing experience and definitely not worth the money  What you are paying for here is the prestige of the Drake and unfortunately they do not deem it necessary to invest in anything else 
N => What a trip I just came back from a week stay at the Drake for a business meeting  I came back to my room the second day to find my room flooded  The pipes had burst and everything in the closet was soaked in brownish type water This included my hanging clothes coat my suitcase shoes actually everything but the clothes I had on  I was told they would send my clothes to an express cleaners but I did not get them back until after  am the next morning with my suitcase and shoes still missing  I had to be at a meeting at  and had nothing to wear but what I had on the day before  I was moved to another room which was noisy because the room next to it had flooded Finally I was moved into a ent room  I had to go to the front desk numerous times and they insisted my suitcase was in my room and had to bring them up to the room to prove it was not I feel they were only somewhat sympathetic to what had happened and that I was really just a bother  They did compensate me with a dinner a breakfast and a movie  And that was only after I insisted because I was stuck in their hotel and could not leave to do anything  I had not coat and it was to cold to go out without out one  It was a very memorable visit  
N => Drake So So I was born and raised in Chicago and though out my life I was told The Drake was the best  I had the opportunity to stay there a few weeks ago  I was some what disappointed  The hotel services were great but the rundown nature of the rooms Soiled carpets chipped furniture and a general dismal appearance left me wondering why anyone would stay there  I took into consideration the age of the building  It really needs a remodeling not to change the character but just to clean it up  It s a shame this grand hotel isnt so grand anymore  
N => A well preserved treasure    Stayed at The Drake with a friend during a bitterly cold MLK weekend  The beautiful lobby was a welcome warm respite from our walking and shopping adventures  The service is quality   the employees seem happy and proud to work there  We received kind greetings from all   the doorman to the restaurant staff and especially the housekeeping staff outside our room  Yes our room was cozy   we shared a two double bed guest room  It was well presented and clean  The bathrooms are functional   not spacious but functional  I venture that some of the less flattering reviews on here are from some that expect early th century charm to be upgraded to st century glitz  Ill leave the glitz to Disney  If you stay at this hotel you can be assured that youre visiting a piece of American history  Cherish it  
N => Disappointment The lobby is gorgeous the location is great but our room left much to be desired  We had a ior suite overlooking Michigan Ave  The room wasnt big but it was adequate  The bathroom on the other hand was so small there wasnt room to put a makeup bag on the sink  The dryer was wimpy but the water pressure in the shower was great  The heater worked once durning our three day visit  The rest of the time our room was uncomfortably cool  The carpet was shabby which gave the room an overall rundown feel  Old world splendor leaves much to be desired  
N => Major disapppointment We were hugely disappointed with The Drake  We stayed  nights in a ior suite at The Peninsula but wanted to try the quotvenerablequot Drake Hotel with its SinatraPrincess DianaHeads of State history and were looking forward to old fashioned grace and luxury in place of the modern luxury of The Peninsula  Instead we just found the place old and tired  Our quotsuitequot was clean of course but a bit of a bowling alley long and sparsely furnished  Drapes on all six windows constantly fouled and wouldnt open properly light in mini bar closet was out and the carpet and mini bar itself was installed so poorly it was embarrassing  Worst of all however was the hot water  It took literally   minutes of running the shower on full hot before the water was slightly warm same with the bath  Someone appeared both times we complained but their answer was just that quotits an old hotel sir  Best to just let the water run and let the hotel pay for it till it gets warm quot Practical advice certainly but not helpful and a disgrace in a room for which they charge  per night plus  valet parking plus taxes etc  We commented more than once how our one night stay at a Hampton Suites on the road passing through Ann Arbor MI was superior to The Drake in every way for less than   of the cost Our quotlake viewquot suite was on the second floor   not much of a lake view from there through the trees  Save your money and take a city view room especially with the unco operative drapes The service was as good as you would expect no better no worse  Reservation staff was friendly and helpful two concierges were excellent one was just showing up  As this is written  a week later I have received no reply from the hotel to my comments which they invited  The Cape Cod Room restaurant was OK as well but only as a late night last minute choice in a city full of fine restaurants  The quotExecutive Loungequot on the top floor was OK as well but not even as big as our room Unfortunately The Drakes best days are long behind it kind of pathetic the fancy bound history of the hotel they leave in each room highlighting its past glory that it can only dream of now  Dont be fooled by the website photos of Princess Diana etc    now its just an old run down relic  The Drake could take lessons from The Royal York Hotel in Toronto on how to keep a grand old hotel grand  You want to stay in a first class Chicago hotel forget The Drake stay at The Peninsula  
N => our Anniversary My wife and I stayed here for our  th wedding anniversary  We were upgraded to a sweet upon our arrival  The staff was wonderful On our first night there wich was our anniversary we came back to our room to find a chocolate mousse cake that read happy anniversary This was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed at  We will definatley be back many years to come 
N => The Hilton sisters better focus on their hotel legacy instead of reality TV Shock and disappointment is all I have to say about our stay at the Drake  We made a reservation two months in advance for a suite and a king room we gave our credit card number at the time of our reservation so that they could immediately charge us for the rooms which they explained was a necessity so that we could receive their quotspecialquot rate    how many other luxury hotels do you know that resort to charging you up front for a discount In good faith we proceeded and were given a confirmation number  Trusting that the Drake was a reputable hotel with competent staff we felt assured that our reservation was complete  The evening of our arrival  in the evening we were informed by the desk staff that our reservation had been cancelled  By whom We had no idea nor did they  We gave them our confirmation number and it was not accepted  The management was consulted but refused to speak to us  The help was left to settle the situation  With few options at hand we were forced to ask for any rooms available  We were given x quotclosetsquot with views of the roof tops and pigeon poop  Not only were the rooms small they had bath drains that did not work complete with extra hair from the last guest to prove it less than adequate air conditioning that kept you up at night and sounded like the worst motel unit you have ever experienced and finally the towels were like rubbing yourself with dried parsley  We were never contacted by the management during our stay and at check out we were handed a bill that would have equalled ANY stay in the BEST room at a REAL hotel in Chicago  The end of my story is do yourself a favor and stay at the Ritz the Four Seasons or ANY other hotel that knows how to treat and respect their client  
N => Not so  drake  as Id dreamed    We were a party of  in  twin bed rooms from  th to e rd   rooms were quite OK but the rd was so small and facing a wall that we complained and after much begging were given a half lakeview one rd floor  It was unusually cold   less than normal but the heating was off and the best they did was giving us very old and not so efficient small heaters  The inroom TV hotel services account gave each day a different and wrong total so we spent every morning half an hour waiting anc complaining to a most untypical Assistant Manager    no french no spanish speaking  The public rooms are nice but not gorgeous  Best assets housekkeping maids and buffet breakfast  
N => Easter  It was everything I expected and more  The room was well organized the food was wonderful there were serveral staff members to assist with all of my needs the dessert room was impressive and the desserts were definately home made  I had a wonderful time in a beauftiful room and would highly recommend The Drake 
N => meet my standards This might be very opinionated type as i discussed  but the employees not the hotel itself met my standrads and should I sayquot offered me more than I expected   and I have to paved and recognized them by doing soIt will give me a comfort of acknowledging the certain individuals that made me and my fiance vacation spree spectacularwhen the doormanNEIL HANDED MEa ticket he was very generous to direct me in the lobby I was mesmerized that it was so busy and he still have time to show me where it is I remember the receptionist Lorenzo who was extremely kind to give as a lovely room overlooking the lake take note without additional cost  and wish us for a lovely staythen right after the bell hop guy co who informed us evry detail in room  He explained things prompt we adore the coq d or loved the concierge tom who recommends a good dining place  OVERALL I LOVED THE EMPLOYEESWHO OFFER SUCH A ABOVE EXPECTATION 
N => NO that great The Drake was an okay hotel  very old  I expected mote from this hotel  they need to reate their rooms   service was great at the hotel  employees are very helpful though I would not stay here again  very disapponted with the rooms  we were given  full beds 
N => RUINED OUR THANKGIVING HOLIDAY The Drake is horrible  They ruined our Thanksgiving with stale food horrible service  quotHey if you going to tack on a   gratuity youd better earn it Whats worse is the management has not been responsive to my complaints  That is a  star hotel PLEASE    Make note I am not the only one that has written a review like this for the quotDRAKEquot If you have a special occassion dont depend on them to meet the need  DONT SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY AT THE DRAKE HOTEL  The dinner was HORRIBLEWe are also going to seek relief if they dont refund the money we paid for the quotmealquot 
N => The Best Ive stayed at  In il  my friends dad suprprised us with a trip to Chicago for her birthday  Upon our arrival we got off the plane at OHare airport and boarded a taxi  While we were riding my friends dad called the Drake to see if there were any openings  There were  As we pulled up to the Drake my friend and Is jaws dropped  We were very quotWowedquot  The bellman took our bags gave a ticket stub and took our bags up  We walked into the hotel again being quotWowedquot  We went up the stairs to be greeted by a huge vase full of flowers  I stood next to it and it was taller than me and Im  feet  We turned and walked to the check inout counter  Check in was quick  We were told we would be staying one the st floor  one story up from Lobby L level  and that our room number would be room   We walked to the elevators where another bellman took us up  The hallways were so quiet  We walked to our room slid the key in and the door wouldnt take the card  After about  times we went and got someone  The housekeeping came with the master card  The door opened  They said they were very sorry and then left  We went to see our view A view of Michigan Ave  Our beds were great and we had two beautiful ble bathrooms with beautiful soaps and shampoos  A mending kit and a shower cap  Even more  The bathrooms had a hairdryer  I would pack a hair dryer I have short thin hair and it took me about  minutes for me to dry my hair and when we had to go eat it still wasnt dry and an extending magnifiying mirror  We had a safe an excellent closet walk in  When we opened the door to the minibar our jaws dropped again  A stocked fridge a trow away caa gummies snacks crackers candy etc      The mini bar came with a price list  whooow    for a trow away caa  We had to buy it because there wasnt a store that sold caas until  minutes away We only bought the caa  The tv was huge  We had wireless internet on the tv like the new Msn Tv  You could access your e mail for a fee  There is a neat book in the room about the Drakes history  Queen Elizabeth II stayed there We had free postcards and stationary in our room  We went shopping  Our bags were taken up to our rooms by the bellman we returned to a broken door lock again  Housekeeping came and fixed it again Around  we went to dinner at the Rosebud Steakhouse just a short miniute walk down the street  The food was great  Our waiter was Teddy  At the end of the meal I said my compliments to the Chef  As we were about to leave Teddy brought out the chef so I cound meet him and tell him personally  I want to be a cook when I grow up   Later on we left to see the Lion King on Broadway around  We came back around   Our door was finally fixed  We ordered a sunday and a coke from room service  The sunday was   and the    Five dollars total for a snack  Room service promptly delivered it  We set the tray outside our room to find we we woke up and left the hotel to go home the tray was still there  We did have a free complimentary newspaper outside our door through  I would love to come back to the Drake again and you will love it too  
N => Great  Days  
N => City Apartment with Most Amenenties but NOISY This was good alternative when most hotels were booked  It was spacious had modern design and was very clean  However the proximitythe to El made for some poor sleep  The station announcements ran lateinto the night as well which was hard to get used to While this place is stocked with most of your needs down to the cheese grater in the kitchen please be aware that they do not provide hair dryers Intelligentsia coffee is right around the block Also theres a  Eleven connected to the building so you can get somebasics without venturing outside  
N => Never again The hotel has a beautiful lobby  Very large  I think the ceilings in the lobby were at least  stories tall  Wonderful architecture  Very classy  Now to the rooms  I had a King room that I booked on Priceline  You dont get to select the type of room on priceline like you do on expedia orbiz or any other travel site so I had to call to make sure I had a King room  I was also told by a friend to ask for the more renevated room which I was able to get I guess  The room was very very small  the bed was about  or  feet from the door  The room had a desk and a chair but no extra comfy chair  No dresser to store my clothing  The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it  The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall tacky including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv  tacky again  The bathroom was ok small but ok   I order room service a  cheeseburger and soda turned out to be  after state tax city tax room service fee   gratuity for room service orders  And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray  Seriously A soda in the vending machine was   and so was bottled water  Luckily there was a  elevan down the street for my late night cravings   I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning  At am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door  Mind you the bed is close to the door  I felt like I was being punked  I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door  They didnt finish vacuuming the long azz hallway til and hour and a half later   There was no view from my window only the back fire escape and the building next to me   I would never stay at this hotel or suggest anyone stay here  
N => Service Poor Beautiful Hotel   Poor ServiceYesterday we arrived at am early   front desk upsold us to a suite   beautiful suite  Told us it would be ready in about an hour    would put a rush on it  It was ready at pm  When I asked why it took so long when they rushed it I was told they did not have to guarantee any room until pm  What a spirit huhThey are offering Thanksgiving Dinner today reservations only  There is no advertising of this    So I asked at the front desk if we could get reservations  Sorry all sold out  Can you imagine not making dinner available to your own customer on Thanksgiving I am very turned off by this hotel  Mgt can reach me in   if they wish    I will be here thru tomorrow Regards Ray 
N => security was not on the ball My husband and I stayed her for ou anniversary  otel was nice rooms small and bathrooms even smaller  Our last night there we were awaken at  in the morning by our neighbors fighting     yelling    doors slamming name calling  I waited a few mintues and it only got worse so I called down stairs to let them know  They said they would send someone up right away  About  minutes later I called again they then said they would send them up  I did hear a knock on the neighbors door but they did not answer  I was already pretty upset and awake so my husband and I packed up and got out of there  The down staris staff said that they would give us breakfast on them   however    Breakfast does not compair to a horrible night of sleep  
N => Lobby the highlight Room   th floor left much to be desired broken shower head broken towel rack no coffee service carpet dirty Puzzled that the cost of the quotContinental Breakfast Buffetquot in the lobby restaurant was more expensive than ordering a full American breakfast through room service    Poor soundproofing between rooms and between room and hall  
N => if you book through hotwire be prepared to be treated poorly Upon check in met with an older white male clerk who looked at me as though I smelt bad when he saw we booked through hotwire  I am an African American female He proceeded to say they were sold out on a Tuesday night and offer me a roll away in a partial suite or a smoking room  There are no amenities except USA today   not even a coffee maker unless you pay for it Room very small in back corner of hotel  We travel alot   sometimes with hotwire most time not  When we do however we have still been treated courteously and given a ent room  As a Chicago native I am aware of the history and the age of the hotel but it was disappointing at best  Great location is biggest benefit  
N => Do not stay here For the price we paid for the room we were surprised that the exercise facilities were not included  There was no refigerator in the room  The beds were full size not queen as stated  Internet not included either  Do have drinks in the lobby 
N => Worst Hilton experience ever   do not go here  I had literally to discuss two hours with the front desk before I HH Gold got upgraded to Executive Level  It was a stinking smoking room  It was very small and after turning the water tap it came brown water for some minutes before it got clear  The telephone in the room did not work and the LAN cable NO WIFI AVAILABLE  was broken  You can only order in room breakfast for the next day till pm and had to wait  minutes on the phone till my call at service was answered  Again regarding the quality and service this was by far the worst Hilton experience I ever made be except Hilton at PHL Airport   avoid at every cost and spend your money elsewhere  
N => Ill be back We took the train to Chicago for a few days over the fourth of y  Great location as we were able walked everywhere we wanted to go from that hotel  including to and from the train station  The main lobby was stunning  The staff was professional  The room was clean  The price was very reasonable  The room was a bit small and the loop is located right along one side of the hotel which is a bit loud  I would definately stay here again  
N => Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Location Hotel was beautiful rooms were nicely done and was perfectly located for walking to theater Millenium Park shopping  Hotel restaurant was just okay even though was hyped but bar was nice and worth a visit  Corner Bakery just around the corner for inexpensive breakfast  
N => Great Location Fun Lobby First off use Priceline  I got a room for  a night  The hotel itself was quite nice  The location cant be beat  You can walk to a ton of great stuff  The staff was really helpful  The Lobby bar was fairly hoppin at night  The room was smallish but not too bad  I would stay there again in a second 
N => Better than my expectations I was apprehensive when my friend told me she booked this hotel for our y th Taste of Chicago trip  Why because the price was really good considering it was so close to Millienum Park  However the hotel was better than i thought  We was in a great location  The park was a  min walk away buses and trains  mins away stores such as Nordstrom Rack Urban Outfitters Office Depot was around the corner a Starbucks downstairs and bar downstairs  The room was ent size and clean  The bathroom was CLEAN  most important to me  The conceirge provided an umbrella  CONS Parking is VERY expensive  Cleaning crew came in late in the day  
N => good place to stay Stayed for two nights while attending business meetings  Room was lovely although a very long walk from elevator around three corners which as a waoman I dont appreciate  Well furnished safe in the closet and a smallish but well fitted bathroom  One thing missing was an in roomcoffee maker  My only complaint is that when I arrived I had to carry my suitcase from the front doors up a flight of stairs to the lobby  I later discovered an elevator but it was quite a walk away and not visible from the entrance  Surely they could have discretely added an escalator  Did not visit the bar or restaurants other than Starbucks for coffee  Heard one guest complaining that he would have to pay  to use the treadmill   he was heading out to run on the streets instead  Although I was there for business I must note the fabulous location   block from Millenium Park and close to great shopping FIlenes basement shall Fields Nordstrom Rack      I dont know what the regular rates are   my rate was very reasonable negotiated through the meeting host  A lovely historic hotel very well reated  
N => ent Stay Good Location but     We stayed at this hotel for one night during the last weekend of ust so we can enjoy downtown Chicago  The good The lobby was beautiful and our room was nice enough  The location was also great and  blocks from Grant Park which made sightseeing super easy  Also it was one block away from most buses the red line and  blocks away from the blue making travel from the airport affordable although they had construction so the trains were running in sections with bus service in lieu of train service   really annoying  The beds were super comfortable which was nice  The bad We had the handicapped accessible room booked through Orbitz which made the room large enough for  people  Unfortunately there was no shower tub so we had a quotsmall lakequot in our bathroom after everyone showered  Also there were other little things such as the room had a musty smell when we walked in and the toiletry products seemed watered down  Also we had to ask for extra towels although they knew we had  people in the room  The hotel staff was nice enough but this was NOT a Hilton caliber hotel but similar to a upscale Howard Johnson  They also charge you to use their gymfitness center which I thought was insane  All in all it was affordable compared to the other hotels but its good to know what to expect before booking 
N => looks great but    We arrived after a trip from sunny maui only to arrive to a rainy chicago Got to the hotel to find a grand interior lobby although busy looked the part The room was a different matter  a single room with a double bed a very tight to space to say the least  We were probably unlucky but thats life 
N => Absolute Perfection This hotel is so wonderful in so many ways  You must stay here when you travel to Chicago   it will really take you back to a time in society when things were so grand  The proximity to Millennium Park is amazing  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Chicago 
N => Good but not as good as it thinks it is First impressions were of a grand ornate hotel  We walked to the hotel from Chicago station and it took about  minutes asit was quite easy to find  We lugged our cases up the stairs to the first floor lobby and reception and then discovered the escalators  We arrived a bit early and couldnt have an early check in without paying an additional   We left our luggage there no charge and went for a walk until the time was right  I found the reception staff a bit aloof and quite hard to understand  They rattle everything off so quickly its hard to take everything in  Anyway as there were  of us we were offered an up grade on our room  For an extra  dollars per night we could upgrade to executive level which gave us use of executive lobby continental breakfast hors dhoeuvres between  and pm snacks and drinks all day and use of pc  We ided this would be a good move as breakfast for  would cost more than  dollars on its own  This also meant we could use executive lift which doesnt stop at all the other floors  It was definitely worth doing and food and drinks provided were really good  Our room was very nice although nothing special considering we were on executive level  shower was very nice though with  shower heads  Housekeeping was ok although as usually happens despite the fact there are four of us they didnt leave the right number of towels and we had to keep phoning down for more  We did have a meal in the lobby restaurant one evening which was ok  but for the price we werent keen to rush back there  Location was good for us as we were going to Chicago Theatre as well and thats really close by  It was about  minutes walk to the Magnificent mile and about  minutes to Shedd Aquarium  We enjoyed the walks and exploring and the lovely walk along the river  We would definitely go back there  It was our first visit to Chicago and we thoroughly enjoyed it  I think the hotel could be improved if the staff could be a little less stuffy and more friendly  
N => Room felt like a closet The exterior and lobby of the hotel were beautiful  The staff was friendly  The location was excellent just a block from the Art Museum  The room was incredibly small   sq ft  Once we brought a crib in we could hardly move  There was a tiny desk with one chair and nowhere else for anyone to sit  We had to eat on the floor  The bathroom was so narrow you could not get in without the door being opened to the maximum extent  There was no coffee maker in the room  Needless to say I would not recommend this hotel for families  We got the room through Priceline for a good price but once I got there I would have glady paid more for a ent sized room  
N => Reminded me of my dorm room in college i walked my room and measured it at x just a little bigger than my dorm room in college  the window overlooked the other wing of the hotel reminding me of the movies where the blind opens to a brick wall  the lobby was beautiful but misrepresented the actual room  bed was uncomfortable  
N =>  bid on priceline   Diamond level floor   SWEET I was unsure of this hotel because of the mixed reviews but we loved it  Upon check in we were told we would be staying on the Diamond Level floor  We had a huge room with king bed  As we walked into the bathroom we realized it was a handicap accessible as the shower was flush with the floor  There was no shower head but a detachable one that you could not raise up to shower head level  That was annoying to take a shower with but got the job done  But after reading the other reviews this seemed like a small problem  Every night we requested water to our room which was brought to us free of charge I assume this was a Diamond Level perk  The locale was great for us as it was near Millennium and Grant Parks and within walking distance of the Mad Mile  
N => Nice big hotel convenient location and I love Priceline This was my second time using priceline to bid for lodging  After a successful stay at our first hotel using priceline I was glad to use Priceline again  This time I was more experienced and was more prepared  I went to tripadvisor and searched for the city that wanted to stay in and the word priceline in my search  This brought up all the reviews with people mentioning their accepted bids  This gave me an idea of the lowest amount that would be accepted  My bid of  was accepted and we were assigned this hotel  Like a ritual after knowing where we would stay I went and read all the reviews on this hotel  I wasnt so much concerned about all the negative reviews anymore   but I did learn of what to expect  Such as the small bathrooms the prices of parking the huge number of rooms this hotel has  How they were amenable to switch room if you do request them to For us our room was neat standard size and clean  We were in a corner of the building so we got two windows in our room  And luckily for us we were on the quiet side of the building because I wouldnt want to be on the side thats next to the train  But I dont think it would be a problem for us to ask for a room change if we did get put on the noisy side  My only problem was the small bathroom  I felt uncomfortable in it and hated it   but this was a minor issue  Like I say in all my reviews the price I paid for I was happy with anything  But even if I was on a business trip and my company had to pay full price for this   There wasnt much to complain about anyway  Oh yeah the swimming pool was small   but better than no swimming pool I guess And to all the complainers about having to pay for internet connection  Ive never NOT been charged for internet in all my stays at other hotels so this is really not new  As for no cofee maker in the room   that seems to be the industrys trend in this slow econonmy so get used to it We did self parking for  unlimited access if you bill it to the hotel instead of the hotels valet parking of   The self park building is adjacent to the hotel so the walk was non existent  It was no problem at all Beside for the  days we stayed in the area we never even used our car  The hotel is a block from the southern end of the Magnificent Mile  And just  blocks from the Art Institute of Chicago which offered free admission on Thursday and Friday from pm pm  I thought that was great because we wouldnt have paid the full adult to get in  We love the Corner Bakery next to the hotel and its chilled Strawberry Almond Swiss Outmeal  We found the greatest restaurant in town Its called Webers Grill  Weve never had more tender steak and BBQ chicken the BBQ ribs werent that reat though  If I do come back to visit Chicago again it would be because of this restaurant Overall we would stay at this hotel again  
N => No rest for the weary Let me preface this review by first saying that I pricelined my reservation and therefore expected to get a slightly less than stellar room at the Palmer House Hilton  Because of the price I paid I did question if I should write this review   but ided to do so because the Hilton is classified as a  star hotel on priceline   and I found a few things that were not so  star about the hotel First the pros  GREAT location   Room was very very clean  It was on the small side but certainly workable even though the bed appeared to be something between a queen and a full size so my quot husband wasnt all that comfortable   Never a long wait for an elevator  Starbucks in the lobby was convenient for that early AM coffee run there are no coffee makers in the room but that didnt bother me as im more of a starbucks kieNow the cons  While the size of the room didnt bother me the bathroom was very very small  I am a small person and I had a hard time getting into the shower   it is a tight squeeze bt the door and the toilet  The plumbing could use some work  I understand it is an old hotel but i swear we heard it every time someone flushed the toilet on the entire th floor  It was LOUD Also the water pressure in the shower was highly variable as was the temperature  I guess the shift from warm to freezing to blazing hot did serve to wake me up but it was not welcome     The walls are paper thin  This was the biggest problem that we had  There was a couple that had some kind of domestic dispute going on in the room next to us BOTH NIGHTS starting around AM  I actually considered calling    the first night it was that bad no Im not exagerating but as the conversation was in a foreign language i could not clearly discern if someone was in danger  I was up for hours hearing our neighbors crying and screaming it was just ridiculous  The second night it started at AM and I quickly retrieved earplugs but they did not block all the noise  Now this is obviously not the Hiltons fault the yelling part but we were on a reated floor    so we were told    and I question why the walls would not be reinforced during the reation if the problem with noise filtration was that obvious Im certainly not the only person with this problem now that I read other reviews Overall the stay was disappointing since we were only in the room to sleep   and that was the only thing we could NOT do  Im surprised that this would classify as a  star hotel given the plumbing problems the noise filtration issues and the lack of ammenities  I have had much better rooms at a Holiday Inn so the  star denotion is questionable Of course someone else might have a superb room so I guess it is the luck of he draw with this hotel  I dont think I would take the risk again  
N => Disappointed My husband and I were given a one night stay in a suite at The Palmer House Hilton as a gift  When we arrived the lobby was packed and I used my Hilton Honors membership to check in so as not to stand in the very long check in line  It was a frigid day in Chicago and the revolving doors never stopped moving which made the lobby area very cold On the way to our room we passed rooms with trays discarded outside the doors   they were still there the following morning  Our suite was huge  The or quite stiff and orated in a Roman type theme  The living room was very large with two sofas a dining table for eight and a full wet bar plus a full bathroom  The bedroom was quite big also with a king bed lovely linens down duvet and loads of down pillows  And another bathroom My husband had work to finish but had a difficult time connecting to the internet  He ended up having to move furniture to connect to a phone jack and talking to the tech department to sort it out  The internet connection in the bedroom was the only place were it would work  I watched TV in the living room and soon discovered how stiff and uncomfortable both sofas were  While my husband tried to get his work finished I had a bath in the bedroom bathroom  It had no vent and soon was steamed up and smelling of mildew    We left the hotel for dinner at a nearby restaurant  Came back to have a drink in the lobby only to find it over run by guests attending functions at the hotel  So it was back to our suite where we slept fine  My husband got up early and went to the Starbucks around the corner to finish his work and brought back a coffee for me  We checked out and were glad to be on our way asap  
N => Great Stay Awesome location Stayed  nights during   for Lollapalooza concert in Grant Park  Superb location  right off Michigan Ave near Grant amp Millennium Parks and the Art Institute any easy walk even in the unbearable heat  Air conditioning in room saved our lives  worked great  Elevators a little slow but it was extremely crowded that weekend  Most comfortable mattresses we have ever experienced  No problems getting exactly the room we booked staff was extremely pleasant and helpful room service was speedy amp delicious and not overpriced compared to other  star hotel menus  Gorgeous lobby beautiful rooms bathroom a little small but who cares There are plenty of mirrors and electrical outlets all over the room to use  Quiet too at least on the th floor which surprised me since there were so many quotyoung adultquot concertgoers there  Loved it We will be back next time in town  
N => Lacks attention to detail  We stayed two nights after getting a ent rate from Priceline  Good points The lobby is spectacular the replacement room was nicely appointed the bed was singularly fantastic  Not so good points No obvious place to stop at the main entrance outrageous parking charges self park day valet day lousy hotel access from self park overcharging our account which was corrected unknowledgeable valet and door people  Our first room had a strong musty smell with a deodorizerchemical finish so we called guest services immediately for a room change which took an inordinately long time  Returning from self park after  p m  the valet entrance was locked and we had to walk around the corner to the main entry in the rain  We avoided the concierge as there was only one person and never less than three people waiting for his time  We wouldnt stay again as too many little oversights affected us negatively  Insufficient consideration for the purported quality of hotel  
N => Disappointment We will NEVER stay at this hotel The staff were rude They gave us a queen bed and asked us if we wanted to update to king bed if we pay  extra  Unbelievable The bathroom was a joke Very small Very inconvenient Also there were hairs on the bathroom floor   There is no closet iron or minibar in the room  This hotel cannot be compared to Hilton Hotel in Chicago where we stayed previously and were very happy It does not deserve these stars  Although it is closer to downtown compared to other Hilton I would rather stay somewhere else 
N => Busy Chaos We chose this hotel because it was close to downtown and I ended up with a good rate of   off using the HIlton Visa Promotion which ends soon  We knew wed arrive late  I contacted the hotel prior to our departure for the trip to let them know  The front desk clerk was extremely pleasant that day and offered to upgrade my room to the Executive Level for   off  I considered but lined because we would not be able to take advantage of the evening lounge activities and with our original   discount breakfast was cheaper to just pay for ourselves  The only room advantages were a quotlarger roomquot and extra bathroom  With that said I thought the rooms would be small but we were pleasantly surprised at how much space there was  The bathroom amp beds were smaller than we are used to standard but the room itself was nice size with two closets and a small hallway my dhter like to play hide and seek in  Although our house has  full bathrooms we all use the same shower same sink etc  so the extra hotel bathroom was a non issue  While talking to the desk clerk she mentioned there were  people checking out and  checking in that day  Phew So while on the road I called a second time to let them know we would be arriving late  It seemed like about the time all  people were checking in because I was put on hold for quite awhile and had a hasty conversation with the evening clerk  I wasnt sure they got the information right but in the end they did  We did have to drive around the block once because the hotel entrancevalet parking was a bit hidden and confusing amongst all the taxis and traffic checking in  We did not take advantage of the  a night valet parking  Instead we asked the hotel valet clerk about parking and we parked ourselves for  a night in the building next door  Check in was pleasant and fast at  pm  Only a couple people in line  We were a little taken aback at how large the hotel is and how many people  actually is  We maneuvered our luggage between guests amp crowds to find the elevators  We knew when booking the hotel there was not a frig in the room so we tugged along a Quest cooler with wheels and kept changing the bags of ice  It saved us a bunch of money to have a few treats and drinks on hand for the kids instead of paying  everytime someone wanted a snack or the outrageous hotel room service costs  In looking at the room they could very easily install a frig plenty of room  The Starbucks on the hotel ground floor was must close early  My husband and  year old tackled the streets of Chicago at pm in search of another Starbucks  It was only a block away drinks were still cold when they arrived but they were stopped by a homeless looking person asking for cash  Oh the price to pay for a fruity drink amp coffee We had the breakfast buffet both mornings  It was very good although a little pricey with a variety of choices even fresh fruit  Someone was constantly filling or replacing the food  We even took a bannana with us Our youngest ate free and we took advantage of the weekend kid special of    I would say it is comparable to country club pricing and variety and service  We knew there was an upper class fitness center on site  My husband and I run so we planned to take advantage of the facility  We didnt know the quotsmall feequot would be  per person per day Pricing should be by the  hour  Also we were asked if we wanted access to the pool  I was excited to think there was a pool other than the hotel pool  The fact is there is not The fitness pool is the same as the hotel pool they just have a arate entrance  The pool was ok  It was very crowded and they ran out of towels  The pool is only open until  pm so everyone with small children was there at   I dont know how the fitness center people managed to swimexercise through the mass of children  Checkout was a real pain  I had a billing question so I headed down to the lobby  But to get to the lobby was quite the trick  The elevators were jammed and refused to stop on the floors to head DOWN  We had to go UP to go DOWN  I never got my question asked because the people checking in were weaved in and out of the ropes in a very long line  I ended up using the hotel phone to do the easy checkout  We did check our bags to be held for free at the Monroe Street entrance so we could eat breakfast wihtout being surrounded by luggage  The room was clean the stay was nice  Might be better at a less busy time  But know going in that it is a huge hotel Saw many staff members cleaning throughout the hotel  Much of the carpet amp fixtures looked rather new  
N => Outstanding Hotel in wonderful Chicago  We booked the hotel through an online hotel site and got it for a bargain price  We had to wonder though quotWhats the catchquot  Well there wasnt one  The reception amp door staff were incredibly polite amp efficient  The lobby was exquisite amp in immaculate condition  The same can be said for the rest of the hotel  Our room was delightful amp had all the home comforts  Huge TV great bathroom big cozy bed  Its only downside was the rather noisy water pipes in the wall right behind the bed that knocked amp banged every  minutes or soThe hotels location was pretty good too  It was a brief stroll to Grant Park amp Soldier Field  mins from The Art Institute  mins walk from all the shops amp just  mins walk from the famous Buddy Guys Blues Bar Overall we had a terrific time here amp would recommend it to anyone  
N => Never Again    has reduced my opinion of Hilton in general I dont leave reviews    positive or negative    very often  But I feel in this case owing especially to the noble history of the Palmer House that an exception is merited  Our family of four stayed there on the th floor just one night ust   and found the hotel is efficient only in service to its bottom line and not to service In other hotels even the lowliest of mo tels for chrissakes there wouldve been wireless or at least a phone book at my disposal  Neither is available to Palmer House guests who are forced to trudge to the over burdened concierge desk    where the lines are Soviet in length    for even the most mundane travel related information  This arrangement is exemplary of Palmer House tactics which seek apparently to herd compliant guests into an utterly dependent relationship with hotel services Yes there was mildew in the bathroom too  But Id be inclined to excuse that owing to the buildings age if only some enlightened attention were paid to guests  Mind you every employee I met was courteous to the extreme  And yet they were emasculated by    who knows what really    but presumably by corporate attention to the bottom line  Everyone was friendly but ineffectual therefore The fact Im forced to waste my time now in addition to my money previously adds insult to injury  But so be it I feel its my responsibility as a considerate human being to warn others  Too bad Palmer House management doesnt take the notion of hospitality as seriously as do I which is ironic considering the fact my own professional orientation is quite unrelated  
N => desk people cold not to say insulting We arrived at  pm and after a long wait without explanation there were no room available    And we had prepaid Two quotsolutionsquot Have an upgrade but we had to pay or wait  hour to have a room cleaned  We chose the second one We dont think they had to clean it but to absorb the water from the defective toilet of the room  Entering the bathroom during the night we had our feet wet and saw the toilet the black tape that quotreparedquot the toilet No coffee machine swimming pool closing at  or  pm  Long wait for the elevators Dont park at the parking of the hotel but in the grant park parking A little walk to spare  Not the  stars worth 
N => Great ambience executive floors good value Picked this hotel because of the bargain price I got considering the location  On arrival Id been upgraded to the executive floors free which was brilliant for me as I ate a huge breakfast and then went back for the  pm snacks so I didnt pay for any food or drink throughout my stay apart from a few  beers in the lobby which I didnt think was too expensive considering the setting  Also there was free internet in the executive lounge which was a bonus Room was OK size but the double bed was probably the smallest I have ever seen in any country let alone America  I was on my own though so it wasnt a problem for me perhaps thats why I got the room and the bed was amazingly comfotable  Bathroom was huge Disappointed to find an day charge for the fitness centre I assume when a hotel advertises itself as having a fitness centre it will be complimentary but perhaps Im out of touch  The pool which was free contrary to some other reviews was small and dim and although claimed to open at  am when I went in at  it was only ankle deep so no morning swim for me Overall a great location for sightseeing and transport and great value on the executive floors but as other people have said the extra charges would have started to rack up and annoy me had I been in a standard room  
N => Good stay at good price Traveling for a long weekend to Chicago to visit relatives and enjoy the city we obtained our reservation at the Palmer House for a great rate  The hotel is beautiful and centrally located however better access to nightlife can be had by staying north of the river  Our room was small but clean  The service was friendly  We did not have a need to use any of the services that others have complained about as being too expensive  so that was a non issue for us  
N => Historic Property The lobby is glorius the price excellent but the service         The desk clerk was surly and several conversations with the hotel quothot linequot were less than satisfactory  We received an exexcutive floor upgrade but the room reeked of cleaning solvent killing what  We opened the windows while going to the Executive Lounge for a drink and snacks  The drinks were overpriced for a hotel club and the offering of pasta and over done mini burritos was not very appetizing  We returned to our room to find the odor had not gone away  On the first hot line call I was informed it was no use to complain because there were no vacant available rooms  The second an indifferent front desk clerk  The third got the personal appearance of a very helpful Housekeeping Manager  She spoke to someone who could make a ision and moved us to suite  If this action had been taken when I first complained I would have thanked them and that would have been the end of it  By the way the desert offering in the Executive Club consisted of cookies  A joke and a disgrace  As a Gold member I expected a newspaper but that was not to bee on the weekend  The hot line operator stated there had been no guest deliveries for months   she was mistaken  No in room coffee maker  I was told at the front desk that many guests did not make coffee  The hotel had to through away quotpast sell by datequot product and was wasting money The whole Palmer House operation smacks of cheap penny pinching management  After one night I pulled up stakes and move to the nearby Hyatt Regency  What a pleasant change 
N => Not the typical Hilton Hotel Old style  very large hotel  Centrally located ideal for business but otherwise I would suggest to select a more modern hotel in the same area  
N => Beautiful old hotel great location beware of extras    We traveled to the Palmer House Hilton and stayed to attend a friends wedding in the city  The lobby was beautiful and our room was nice  We were on the th floor which was newly reated  Contemporary style  Our friends room on another floor was larger and another friends room on a different floor was very small  Our bathroom was tiny  But the king bed was excellent and I loved that the alarm clock had a connector for my MP player  One of our friends got charged for checking in early even though it was   We checked in at  and did not have this charge  Parking was  so we opted to fly instead  I think there was a charge for the fitness center which i did not use but find all these extra fees to be annoying The lobby is comfortable with a nearby bar great for hanging out and relaxing  We had a wodnerful breakfast buffet in the restaurant the mornign we left  It was  per person but worth it  Everything you could want and then some very elegant  A big downside was no free internet access  The location was great  blocks to millenium park  The staff was very friendly  I would stay here again  
N => Such a deal Chicago has become as expensive as NYC so I ided to book a hotel on Priceline and by choosing my location and stars I was able to get the Palmer House for  a night Expedia offered it for   The lobby is stunning the staff friendly and by paying only an additional  per night we were upgraded to the Executive Floor where bfast was free as were snacks amp non alcoholic drinks  the room was HUGE  bathrooms and there was an elevator directly to the rd floor  It was our best trip to Chicago 
N => Great lobby small room We traveled with our mo old dhter to Chicago and stayed at the Palmer House  The lobby is amazing and the check in was quick and pleasant  Our room on the other hand was extremely small allowing barely enough room for our dhters pack n play  We booked our room at Priceline so we got a very good rate which was the saving grace  I would not stay there again   I think I could pay a little more and stay in a true  star hotel  
N => beautiful but disappointing The lobby was amazing It looked like a very fancy place  The room was very small and I paid extra for a queen or king si zed bed   if that was a queen it was ridiculously small Upon check in I requested a couple of extra towels  He assured me they wouldnt be a problem but we never got them  The bathroom was fairly big  Clean  The bed was comfortable except my bfs feet hanging off the end  The location put us within walking distance of Millennium Park and Buckingham fountain but not much else  Overall the room was nice and clean but for what I paid for I was disappointed  Next time Id try another place  
N => y    th Great stay loved it We stayed for  nights  I was really nervous about the type of room we would get since we booked through Priceline and sounds like some people have ended up with closet sized rooms after booking through Priceline  We called a few days ahead of time and requested a non smoking room with  beds  Of course they couldnt promise but noted it on the reservation  My husband was in town ahead of me and checked in at  am and they wanted to charge him   for early checkin  He went to the Hilton Honors desk and she agreed to waive it this one time since he had booked through Priceline apparently he didnt qualify for regular Hilton Honors benefits  He was given a huge corner room on the th floor nonsmoking with  double beds a sofa and desk  It was a little close to the El so too noisy so he requested to be moved further away from the El  He was given another large room on the th floor  The room was non smoking had  double beds a chair and ottoman desk dresser and  closets  Yes the bathroom was small but not unbearably  small  We could still hear the El but not as bad as the first room  Other than the El the room was very quiet  They have several banks of elevators for different floors so we never had to wait long for an elevator  No coffee maker in the room but the Starbucks was right at the bottom of the elevator so quite convenient  We did have to pay for wireless which I think was around night   pretty expensive  But considering we only paid  for the room we still had a great rate overall  Everyone was really nice hotel is gorgeous  The room was reated and very attractive  The beds were super comfortable  Hotel is in great location no car needed  Easy access to El plenty of cabs and lots of sights within walking distance  I would be happy to stay here again  
N => Exactly what I hoped for    I was in town to attend a conference and would not stay at the hotel where it was being said a horrible experience at that chain in the past so I ided to spend a little more and go upscale  It was so worth it  I love old hotels to start so Im aware that sometimes rooms are smaller but this was perfect  Every staff member was attentive and service oriented  I would highly recommend it  
N => never again We arrived at pm to be told thatwe had a double room reserved when in fact we had reserved a twin room  We were then informed that they were fully booked and they could not guarentee us a twin room the next day untill pm We were told it was the fault of our travel agent but as all the other hotels we had used on our holiday had been twins i have my doubts The manager said we could have put up beds in one of the suites for the night and aftera  hour flight i was not in the mood to argue it can only be described as a very plush meeting room we finally got our very small twin room the following day Have contacted our travel agent but no responce as yet On the upside Loved Chicago but woud not stay at the Palmer House again  
N => Nickle and Dimed My son and I paid only  through Hotwire so it was a pretty good value  I thought the place was interesting given they took great pains to retain the historical character of the building  The room was small but clean  They really kill you with the extras here though  No coffee maker  no Wi Fi  well for a price  Parking is outrageous  Location is great but I woulnt pay more than  bucks to stay here  
N => Great considering the price We stayed here  nights  My husband and I got a King as requested  We paid   for early check in but only on one of our  rooms  My son was in a room next to us  We had noise problems one night when the guest on the other side of us had the TV on most of the evening and again from  am until am  I can see where noise could be a big problem here but we paid   a night and the location was terrific the rooms clean beds comfortable  We were able to spend  days exploring Chicago wo a car or taxi the entire visit  
N => The most wretched and stressful stay in a hotel I have ever experienced  We checked in at pm waited in line for a half hour   obviously due to the shorted staff  By pm we were in our room handicapped but smoking  The wall paper was peeling off the walls and the showerhead was coated with lime  We ordered a pizza from the room costing   to use the hotel phone waited an hour and it never came  By  pm we were exhausted from traveling and starving so we ordered room service and paid  twice for our meal     cheeseburgers at  a piece including a rediculously high gratuity    AFTER we had spoken with a hotel associate making it very clear to him that we were going to pay for our room service with cash at check out and not to charge our credit card he assured me our meal would not be charged to our credit card  Our burgers were ordered a medium well    they arrived cold and cooked rare my fiance woke in the morning spending an hour in the bathroom with a stomach ache  Four days later our checking account is overdrawn because the hotel withdrew  for our disgusting cheeseburgers    after I had specifically discussed with the hotel associate not to charge our account  At am the smoking alarms went off in our room ripping my fiance and I from our sleep two and a half hours later we were awoken again to the sounds of loud screaming and banging on walls and banging through the floor beneath us    this went on until am  When we called the front desk nobody answered the first two times and then I was placed on hold for  minutes  We were not impressed by our stay and were so happy to leave we finally got a good nights rest at the riott in Burr Ridge Ill  I will never return to the Palmer House again    I have traveled all over this country and many times to Europe and the Palmer House was the most wretched and stressful stay in a hotel I have ever experienced  
N => High class exceeded my expectations Met all of our needs and aimed to cater to us  We paid around  for  adjoining rooms and valet parking  The hotel was gorgeous and absolutely great service at every corner  I would recommend taking a walk around the area to see all of the great attractions and restaurants  We walked to Millenium Park with  small children and they played in the water and Jersey Boys was playing a block away from the hotel  Room service even brought us up placesettings for us to eat carry out in our room at no charge  The rooms were luxurious and spacious  There was even a Starbucks in the hotel  I would love to stay there again everyone was so nice and helpful The best hotel weve stayed in  
N => not worth the money On the bright side there is a Starbucks in the hotel but thats really the only nice thing I can say about my stay there  I had a room with a king bed reserved  When I checked into the hotel not only did they not have a king bed available they put me in a room that was smaller than most walk in closets  The room was located right next to the house keeping room so I had the pleasure of listening to the housekeeping staff talking about their love life every morning  Even though my room was down graded they still charged me for the delux king room that I had reserved  I travel for business quite a bit but Ive never been charged as much for internet access as I was here    over  US for three days access  Wont stay there again  
N => Room from the s  Booked on a bidding site for a reasonable rate   night plus tax called in advance to request a King or Queen bed and was told that they could not guarantee it but when we arrived  PM on a Friday we were told the only room available was a double  Called reception after trying to get through for  minutes they finally answered and was told this was the only option  To be fair we stayed for  nights and they did leave a message on the rd morning that seemed to imply they would be able to offer another room but at that stage we didnt bother  The room was tiny could barely squeeze by the bottom of the bed which was jammed up against the TV cabinet  I cant recall many hotels where  double bed is on offer   usually  single or  QueenKing  Room had not been re done and was s hotel style dark greens and oons and old wallpaper though I see in other pictures there seem to be some rooms that have been done up  Bathroom adequate  Lobby large but crowded  Waiters friendly but drinks wildly overpriced  Seems as though the hotel is two hotels perhaps a section of nicer rooms for those who are paying full price and a second section of rooms for cut prices  This creates a bit of an odd mix with the crowd as well  Location convenient a bit of a business area but easy walk to Michigan Ave and other sights  
N => Beautiful Hotel but NOISY ROOMS This is my first night here and already I can tell that Im going to get no sleep during my  night stay  I can hear everything around me from the neighbors next door to someone taking a shower above me to the wind tunnel sounds either created by the train or elevator I cant tell to people walking down the hallway talking at a normal voice on their cellphones  I agree the lobby is breathtaking and the rooms are nicely orated  I plan on going to Potters to try their Chicago style lobster dog tomorrow and be one of their famous tinis but you could do this without staying at the hotel  The location is great  you are within walking distance to all the great Chicago sightseeing spots   but dont stay here if youre expecting sleep   or bring earplugs  I wouldnt come here to stay on my own dime unless I got a great rate like  that others had seemed lucky enough to find  
N => Major disappointment I found the staff to be surly aloof and very unhelpful  I discovered my room rate when I checked in was higher than the printout the hotel sent me ahead of time  When I contacted Guest quotServicesquot to discuss it I was greeted with quotSo whatta you wantquot My room was huge with not one but two tiny bathrooms  I paid their early checkout fee and moved to the Hotel Burnham down the street and had a superbly wonderful time aided by friendly helpful staff at every turn  The room cost less too  
N => Lovely facility but let the buyer beware Having read numerous other reviews of the Palmer House Hilton I was inclined to agree with those who said quotHow much can you complain about a  roomquot But that was before I saw our actual room  The hotel and lobby were bustling and absolutely lovely mind you  Not in my taste preferring modern architecture but it was really stunning I called the hotel  days before arrival requesting a king bed  They said they would quotdo their bestquot but couldnt guarantee it  Upon arrival we learned that not only did we not get a king or queen but we got ONE double bed  Not TWO double beds as every other lesser facility in the country mightve had but ONE  The reason being only ONE double bed could fit in our room   how I wish I was kidding  Our room was the size of a postage stamp Dont get me wrong   having asked for a renated room our room was incredibly stylish  But when two adults are squeezed into a double bed    its like being in college again  Neither of us could actually open our suitcases in the room except on the bed because the floor space simply wouldnt allow it  Mine had to go in the closet amp his stood up on end the only way it would fit  We dont typically use the dresser in a hotel when only staying overnight   why unpack only to repack We had quite literally only one foot of walking room between the bed and the chest of drawers left side one foot to the wallcloset center and one foot to the deskwindow area right side  Having to strategically openclose certain doors to stand behind them to move around means a room is TOO SMALL reated or not  I can only really recommend this hotel if you either a dont care about these things or b are willing to pay full price to get what you want  Ive used several discount websites to book facilities before and NEVER wound up in a room so tiny  It was really lable  
N => The worst hotel experience of my life My wife and I stayed in room   The room was tiny the view was horrible but even worse the room was incredibly noisy  There was obviously some kind of plumbing problem and we got woken up at  a m   days in a row when the person in an adjacent room took a shower  It resulted in an extremely loud shrieking noise  I have experienced anything quite like that  To make matters worse there is a steep charge for the fitness center I will never stay at this hotel again at any price  
N => Mind the check out and the air con Staying at this hotel was a step in the right direction compared with my previous visit at a youth hostel I was initially given a double room when I have paid a king sized room but they did not have any as it was just after Christmas so told me that I would have to move into the king sized room the next day The double room was comfortable and cosy compared with the king sized room which was massive  It occupied a corner of the building so I received light from two sides of my room  The air conditioner was freezing I tried to adjust it but it became either too warm or too cold so st uary was spend nursing a coldI ate in the restaurant next to the lobby on st as I didnt think there was anything open locally  There was a good choice of food ranging from fresh fruit cooked breakfast breads cereals but was pretty pricy compared with going to the diner next door At the check out I only had to pay for the water and as it was a small amount I wanted to pay cash and checked with the receptionist if I would be charged on my credit card but she said no  So I paid cash and when I received my credit card statement at the end of the month I found that Ive already been charged for the water So make sure that doesnt happen to youAll in all it was a lovely place to stay as I usually stay in youth hostels or with friends so it was a major treat to be staying in a place of this calibre  But if I was visiting Chicago again I think Ill stay somewhere uptown as its closer to the shops and other sights  
N => nickle and dime you to death Im in for business so I quotupgradequot to the executive level  Internet is extra and even the fitness center was extra The water fountain they call a swimming pool was free but overcrowded  The quotexecutivequot elevator didnt even access the fitness center level  The spa massage was the most overpriced   disappointment ever  Dont even talk about what it was extra to use parking  The minibar in the room was locked and unable to open  I was there for  days and in the SMALLEST room available in any hotel in the U S  No place to unpack my belongings  The toliet paper holder broke  It took an hour and  phone calls to get the DVD player to work  Sorry I had to inconvience the engineer to come to my room and fix it The furniture in the room was missing some molding around the TV  Would have had a lovely view of the city had the windows been washed sometime this century  The quotcomplimentaryquot breakfast was cold coffee and hot milk for cereal  The conceriage could use polite lessons from the housekeeping staff  All the housekeeping staff were WONDERFUL  My friends staying at the hampton inn across the street paid ALOT less and had better service  
N => If the rooms were as nice as the lobby it would make a huge difference I was looking forward to stay at this landk hotel and certainly the lobby is magnificent so when i checked in I expected the grandeur to continue into the rooms  My room was very very average no tea or coffee facilities and old tv no mini bar no amenities only soap no shower gel no coton buds just normal things youll normally find in a hotel of that standard  Next time im in chicago i wont come back to palmer house the riott on Magnificent mile was much better value for money and better appointed  
N => Good Bargain in Loop This is our second time in a year stayiing at this hotel  The first time was in e  and it was under reation  We had a nice room though newly updated or and we got the Priceline or Hotwire rate  Dont pay more than you have to for this hotel  The second time was il  and we got an older room on a higher floor  The bathroom was small and the or was dated  Nice hotel staff  
N => Elevator waits are ridiculous    and other inconveniences Beautiful historic hotel    and since Im in historic building business was looking forward to stay  Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up    duct work torn apart in bathroom lamp fixtures literally falling off wall mirror torn off wall etc  Ended up in a room on th floor    much nicer but yesterday waited  minutes for elevator on two arate occasions  Only two of three elevators to top floors work    and these two elevators skip floors so you can be stuck waiting for ever  When I raised this to hotel staff was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it  Umm no  This is not an old building problem this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it  Thumbs way down stay away  Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if youre looking for old world charm sans hassle  
N => Book on Priceline Stayed in  for valentines day checked in late afternoon everything smooth  Hotel lobby was ornate and unique  Stayed on th floor room was small and basic but didnt expect much more from a historic hotel and booking on priceline  Got it for  on priceline would highly recommend it  Valet parking was  ramp parking   Location was very nice amp walking distance to museums amp miracle mile  Hotel bar was cool but service a bit slow  Concierge helpful on Fri but nobody on Sat Valentines day at   Sunday check out was tedious waited over  minutes for elevator Probably was the floor we on  Valet parking took  minutes but not horrible  Would stay again at this price any time 
N => Just OK My husband treated me to a night in Chicago at the Palmer House for Valentine s Day  After spending most of the day shopping we were ready to put our feet up and relax a bit before dinner  Arriving to check in at approximately  pm the line for check in was nothing like I have ever seen before   I guess it would resemble more of a line I would expect to see at the airport then a line I should expect to see at a hotel  Needless to say our feet did not get the much anticipated relief for another half an hour or more  I would have had a glass of wine to make the wait more enjoyable but I couldn t seem to get over the outrageous price  After arriving to our room I noticed that our room did not resemble the stylish modern king size rooms that they show on the hotel s website it had more of an  s motif with peeling wallpaper  I can t see that anything had been updated in the bathroom in a long time and there was no hairdryer  Yet another disappointment I guess the topper was in the middle of the night with the loud guests on our floor  I know this is not the fault of the hotel but where I do find fault is in the large gap between our door and the floor   with this nice large gap and our room being at the end of a long hallway all of the noise talking etc seemed to filter directly into our room and at times it was like the group was in our room with us  The beds were comfortable but unfortunately we did not get a sound sleep  When we were leaving the hotel in the morning while passing the bags of chips candy pop and liquor that our loud neighbors had strewn about I did notice that the door to our room seemed to be the only one on the floor with the very large gap   unlucky us 
N => Historical Gem This was a great first introduction to Down Town Chicago  I am probably spoiled from here on out  
N => Nice but I felt nickel and dimed I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for three nights when I was in Chicago recently  I was in town for a conference but also had leisure plans  The location cant be beat if you want to be downtown  Its a short cab ride from Union Station and theres a red line stop right outside the hotel  The Art Institute is only about a five minute walk and there are some basic restaurants nearby too  Upon my arrival I was informed that I would have to pay  to check in early  Id spent the night on the train and wanted to freshen up before I went to my conference so I was pretty much left with no choice  I was also informed that internet packages were available for  and  a day  Im sorry but a hotel of this caliber ought to have free internet access especially considering the other Hilton nearby offers it  I was also shocked to find out that if I wanted a coffeemaker in my room Id have to pay extra The staff was extremely friendly and the lobby and other public areas of the hotel are quite beautiful  The restaurants and shops inside the hotel are all pricey but I think thats to be expected  There are plenty of elevators but during busy times theyre incredibly slow  The Starbucks in the basement was a lifesaver and I had no problems storing my luggage on the day I checked out since I wasnt leaving until that night My room was on the thirteenth floor  It was relatively small but was nice  The mattresses were comfortable and the bedding looked new  The room wasnt spotless but it was clean enough to suit me  The bathroom was extremely small it had a great tub and shower but it was nearly impossible to get out without falling over the toilet  Overall the room was nice but was starting to show some wear  The iron was especially old and leaked dirty water all over one of my shirts At night the hotel is well lit and well staffed which made me feel safe  I was out late all three nights but only one night did a staff member ask to see my key card when I came in  I wouldve liked if theyd done that all three nights or if the elevators required a key card  The walls are very thin so there was some noise at night This was my second time staying at the Palmer House Hilton  I got a great conference rate but Im not sure it would be worth a full price stay  Beware that even if you get a good deal theyll get you to pay in other ways while youre there  
N => New Years Getaway My boyfriend and I ided to get away this New Years Eve after staying at home with our children for years while they were all young  They are all over  now and had their own plans so we ided to do something different  We booked the Palmer House because of the beautiful lobby photo on expedias website hoping the rest of it was just as nice We were not disappointed The lobby takes your breath away from the mirrored walls to the fresco ceiling  Our room was VERY comfortable nice bed   the only bad thing was that the bathroom was small   hardly any room to set vanities that we brought along so we had to keep them in our suitcases until we needed them The bar is wonderful   and they make THE most delicious Hot Buttered Rums which we partook of when we came in from Navy Pier on New Years Eve from watching the fireworks in  degree weather   Although   they are quite expensive We each had to drinks and the bill was   But just sitting in such a beautiful place made it worth that total The staff seem friendly enough and allow you to meander through the whole place on your own  I enjoyed all the photos of celebrities past and present mostly past who had come to the Palmer House to perform through the years  We found lovely shots of Eartha Kitt   Dorothy Dandridge   Sonny amp Cher and the like  Its actually how we remembered how to find our room in this huge place until we got the lay of the land  One of the things that I REALLY loved was the fact that the El runs right along the street only about half a block from the hotel so you can hear it all night coming through which I adored  Also the hotel is only one block off of Michigan I would definitely recommend this to couples that are looking for a nice romantic getaway Very lovely like you step back in time  
N => Lived up to Expectations Having grown up in the suburbs I had always heard about the Palmer House and have wanted to stay there for years  Finally over the last Christmas Holiday I had occasion to do so  We had an incredible time at the Hotel  I would like to mention Doug at the Front Desk and Claudia the Front Desk manager who made our stay wonderful  The Lobby is absoulutely gorgeous as everybody else mentioned not much more to say about that We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice and really made our trip as it was cold and there wasnt too much outdoor sightseeing to do  We were able to celebrate our sons Birthday in the suite and have our whole family over to watch the Bears game where if they would have won they would have gone to the Playoffs  Dont get me started on thatThe suite had been remodeled and was very spacious the other thing we noticed about the room that it was completely handicapped accessible  We thought that was great  My only thoughts for the next time we stay there would be to request a room on the side of the hotel that is not nearest the quotElquot tracks  They take a little getting used to The beds were incredibly soft and comfortable  They have ice machines on the floor which is great you dont need to order room service to get a bucket of ice  Theres a Corner Bakery and a CVS pharmacy within  feet of the hotel if you forget anything or just wanted to grab some munchies for the room I hope this helps and I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Its truly historic Chicago  We also discovered a great restuarant a couple blocks North on Michigan Avenue called quotThe Gagequot we ate there twice during our  day stay in the city  
N => What is going on at the Palmer House We recently returned from the Palmer House where we stayed last weekend  We have stayed there many times and this time experienced a few things that have me wondering    We arrived around noon Chicago time and were told our room was ready but if we wanted to check in before pm we would need to pay an additional   Never before have we been told that  Is this just some new way to make some more money I wonder if we checked out early if they would refund us some money  There are no longer any coffee pots in the rooms  That was a big disappointment for us as we like to make a cup of coffee in the am to wake up  Our options were to order room service get up and get dressed and go downstairs to Starbucks or the front desk now has coffee pots for rent  I didnt even bother to ask how much or did that rate include coffee It is pretty amazing that you can stay at a Red Roof Inn or similar and there is a coffee pot and coffee in the room but at a high quality hotel like the Palmer House they cant provide that little extra amenity We had a great time in Chicago our room was very nice and everything at the Palmer House was nice as well  I just cant understand why they have implemented these new policies 
N =>  weeks on my own in a big city   was a great place to be I was there on business for  weeks  Needed a place close to the office and chose this for the hiltonhonours points more than anything else but on arrival I was very impressed  Lovely ancient building with fab features  Huge place to get lost in  Close to everywhere so I just walked and shopped around the area no need for taxis  I did find the restaurant  bar a little intimidating being on my own  Just not very welcoming so following a search found the elephant amp castle pub around the corner was a perfect place to eat amp drink  Very welcoming and within  mins I was happy chatting away with a local at the bar  
N => Classic hotel with snags The Palmer House has a great location and a rekable history  It is elegant and especially so when orated for the holidays  My stay got off to a bad start with a late arrival due to weather problems  At  in the morning I was not eager to find problems but when my smoke free room on a smoke free floor smelled badly of smoke I was not happy  The person I talked to attributed it to smoke smell from another floor  I was too tired to argue  The next day housekeeping put some sort of filter device in the room and it helped a bit but the room smelled for the  day stay My room was in the renated section but it was pretty basic  It was small with the usual comforts except that there was not a coffee maker  Coffee requires a trip to the lovely but expensive restaurant or to Starbucks  The staff was cheerful and helpful and my breakfasts in the hotel restaurant were good at the custoy major city hotel prices  The Palmer House was fine but next time I think I will look for soemthing else in Chicago  
N => Had a blast I just wanted to say that this is a old and elegant hotel  The kind that they do not make anymore and since for the last  years most hotels we have been in are waterparks I was thrilled to get back to a non kid oriented hotel  I stayed with my kids and husband in a double room for  a night and really enjoyed our weekend  Our room was pleasantly bigger than I expected   Luck I do not know but I will remember that room number  I was on an updated floor and we liked it  The pool is small as I expected in downtown Chicago in a hotel of that age  We were not there to be in a room as well we were there to get out and have a nice family weekend mainly outdoors  The staff was nice when I needed them  I am not high maintenence nor am I slob this place was fine and I will go back again at Christmas time to enjoy fun activities with my family and hope to get the same room  Thanks  
N => Substandard Accomodations Even the  priceline rate failed to buffer the ordeal that culminated after our  night stay here this past weekend  Upon checking out the valet office discovered that my vehicle keys were lost not a comfortable prospect on a cold snowy Sunday morning in Chicago hours away from home  I personally had to search the key storage area of the valet office where many hundreds of car keys were stashed away  After finding the keys myself the staff realized they had no record of my car being parked and for a time debated whether or not the car would be findable  After an hour of resolving these two issues we were told that our luggage which had been transported via cart by a bellhop was also missing  When I suggested that the bellhop who assisted us with our luggage be located and asked about the location of our bags I was told that there was no way to contact him and we would quotjust have to waitquot for him to show up  This was  minutes after he left our room  Finally I was taken to a storage area where once again I had to locate our property  This whole sequence of events becamre progressively surreal and needless to say I couldnt get out of there fast enough  Never again  Oh yeah the rooms were small the bathrooms tiny  No coffee makers in the rooms and one designer shaped Void of practical usetrash can in the bathroom  
N => Not what it used to be This was my th and probably final time staying at the Palmer House  My family and I stay here the week after Thanksgiving every year  There is a very large medical conference that a family member of mine participates in and my husband and I join for some exra time we would not otherwise get with the family  My first few years I was highly impressed with the Palmer House and its offerings  At the price we were paying I would expect to be impressed  Even last year amidst all of the reations which were only extensive to the quotstreet level and poolspa it was still impressive  We always stay on the quotExecutive Levelquot because of our quotstatusquot with Hilton Hotels HHonors  On this level you need a special key to access the floor and its executive lounge  In the lounge in years past we were greeted with a nice amount of options both hot and cold for breakfast  Large bagles fruit hot oatmeal fresh bread eggs or something similar and wonderful Douwe Egberts coffee Tazo teas hot chocolate and a fridge full of sodas and juice  All free for the taking  This year there were no hot offerings not even packets of oatmeal  Only toast small bagles small dried up muffins and pastries  The coffee has been switched to Lavazza which sucks the soda is still available but they are small bottles  The small botles were not the bad part as they are still a good amount  The problem is that in the week I was there I was never able to open a bottle  I did not see one woman able to open a bottle the entire time  Not even the bar tender  I was told by an employee in the executive lounge that they cut backs were made because of the economy  That    I can understand  Read further Part of the new reation is the spa and pool  The pool is average but by no means looks like it has been remodeled  Not to mention you have to walk and walk and walk down all types of back hallways past conference rooms to even find the pool  Odd since they frown upon you wearing a swimsuit around the guests  Not sure how to get from your room to the pool otherwise  be thats why theer was never anyone at the pool the whole time I was there during a week the hotel was completely sold out  Which is another point  There were NUMEROUS things that the hotel has cut back on to save a dine here and there but the price of the closet size paper thin walls have gone up  My king size bedroom closet size room was  a night  They have taken all of the coffee makers out of the room which they had installed brand new the very week I was there last year  Even a budget hotel offers a coffee maker in the room  They said this was part of the cut back  So now you are forced to buy their coffee from room service which we did one night   cups of af    plus a tip  Did I mention that if you are one of the lucky few to get executive level status there is no af I had to call and ask why there was no af because the employees of the exec  lounge just said quotits not offeredquot every time I asked  It was eventually brought up the last  days of my stay  The concierge recommended a restuarant called quotTavern at the Parkquot which is just next to Millenium Park our first night there  But my husband and I received a healthy dose of food poisoning  I dont recommened this place to eat  The second day a couple moved into the room next to us  As mentioned above the walls in the hotel are seriuosly paper thin  The couple began having sex at pm on Sunday and didnt stop until am on Monday  They were anything but quiet  I tried knocking on the wall slamming my door slamming a closet door which they also did frequently and at am I called security and told them to handle it before I did  The couple quieted down from   when they picked up where they left off  Security stated that they have done alll they can do  Now we are talking two nights with no sleep  I did go to the front desk the next morning and complained  They happily moved us to another floor and a bigger room  We were told it was a  bed  bath  It would have been had the second bath not been under construction  To conclude this long review and I could certainly go on and on    if you are new to the Palmer House you will not know anything is wrong except the rooms were absolutely freezing the whole time  If you are a returning guest    you will most definately notice some serious changes  
N => NICE PLACE ON SURFACE BUT WATCH CLEANLINESS The Palmer House is a nice place to stay  Overall visit for  days was ok  Room service was pleasant and efficient  Maid service needed to be more thorough  Upon Check in we encountered blood spatters all over the wall and tiles in the bathroom  Maid came up and cleaned it right away  Upon taking a shower the next morning we discovered more blood spatter all over the shower tiles  Upon notifying the hotel management we were told there are no comment cards or formal complaints available at this time  We wrote the incident on a letterhead for the management  It is  days later and no apologies or responses from the management whatsoever  Upon being more attentive to the cleanliness of the room we noticed minor oversites on the cleaning aspect   hair left in the shower toothpaste ks on the mirror a dirty towel re folded and placed with the fresh towels   On the surface everything looks wonderful and clean  Just be aware to check the cleanliness of your room if you plan to stay here  
N => Weekend get away I reserved a room at the Palmer House for a one night get away as part of a gift to my husband for our one year anniversary  We went to check in at the lobby at approximately pm  The clerk said that our room was not ready which we were very surprised to hear especially at that late hour I forgot that I had written in that it was our anniversary upon reserving the room  She left to check on the status of our room and when she came back she let us know that she had good news she was able to upgrade us to a suite All of the suites had been recently reated  It was on the th Floor Upon arriving at the suite it was one of the nicest suites that we had ever stayed in  We were almost sad that we couldnt share it with friends while we were there I have uploaded pics of the suite We had a HUGE living room with several couches ottomans chaise lounges table chairs flat screen tv  etc  A dining room area with seating for  inlcuding a wet bar  bath rooms and a bedroom  
N => Beautiful hotel  The hotel was beautiful Very busy but check in went smooth We received a older room witch i was not happy about i ask for a room on a remodeled floor and they gave me a big corner room that was awesome They were happy to do so and did it in a timely manner  If you choose to stay here ask for a remodeled room Hotel is close to everything  Subway stations right outside  
N => Reservation Rate Sham In tember of this year my wife and I used the Palmer Houses hotel reservation website to book a stay with check in ember  and check  out ember   On tember   we received a confirmation e mail from the Palmer House confirming a quotbed and breakfastquot rate of   per night On ember  we realized that we needed to arrive in Chicago a day earlier on ember   We phoned the Palmer House reservation office and requested a room for ember  and noted that we already had reservations for ember  to   My wife was told that since we were quotchanging our reservationquot the confirmed rate of  per night was no longer applicable and that it would now cost us  per night for the entire stay  My wife explained that she understood why the cost for ember  mught be more but not why the dates of ember  to  as the rate for those dates had been confirmed by the hotel previously  After further discussion my wife asked for the reservationists manager  I spoke with the manager and he confirmed that we could not simply add a day to our reservation because we were changing our entire reservation  He then told me that the rate would now be  per night for our entire stay So in less than two minutes the rate had now increased another  per night  The only excuses for the increases in price for the room per night we received were quotthe system does not allow us to give you the rate you originally bookedquot and quotyou are changing your reservation quot We simply cancelled our reservation and have booked elsewhere for our stay The staff we spoke to were perfectly polite  However there was no interest whatsoever in attempting to keep our business or work with us  The staff was not able to explain when asked why it would be different if we had simply hung up the phone and either called back or e mailed a new reservation for ember  which would have then resulted in only one day increase in rate for our stay we understood that we might have to change rooms between ember  and   For a venerable hotel to have policies such as these and apparently no interest in treating customers satisfactorily is a true disappointment  The Palmer House will never receive our business as a result of this experience  
N => Not Four star Services We stayed at this hotel    it was booked through Priceline as  star in the loop  Lobby and public places beautiful and historic but rooms very varied and not as nice as other hotels with same rating  The worse part of this hotel is they nickel and dime you to death  Very expensive charge for internet in your room and lobby  No coffee makers or fridge in rooms and coffee not available in lobby without purchasing a styrofoam cup for   It is a great location but after two years receiving this hotel after bidding I think Ill have to make sure we try a different hotel on our next visit  
N => A reasonable hotel if you happen to get via Hotwire or Priceline We stayed at this hotel for a night  Positive points location is great  mins from Art Institute Millenium park etc  We got the room on hotwire for   taxes so it was a good value  Otherwise this is a type of a hotel which pretends to be expensive but virtually everything is done with rather bad taste  So it is not worth its standard  smth price at least from my pov  Anyway rooms were clean beds were convenient no noise so no real complaints  Service was also OK  Breakfast was not particularly good and somewhat pricey smth like  for an omlette but you can go to smaller places around  There is an official parking for the hotel one block from the hotel  a night  Again if you are not going to use your car when in Chicago you can probably find a cheaper parking around but you will not be able to re enter it  Internet as you would expect in upper range hotels in US is not free too    about  and no wifi cable  be you can find rooms with a nice view but our room did not have one probably if you pay full fee you will get better rooms  
N => Horrible service someone on the staff stole from me I was in Chicago with two friends for a class  We knew we wanted to stay downtown so I booked this hotel through pricelines name your own price  While we were gone our toilet overflowed and it was fixed by the staff but our carpet was still wet when we got back from class that evening  We also discovered that my ipod had been taken from the table in our room  The only people who had been in our room that day were the hotel staff so it had to be one of them who took it  We called the front desk multiple times to fix both problems and security was quick to start an investigation but the maintenance staff never cam to talk to us about our toilet or our wet carpet  The front desk and security said that maintenance was on their way to our room but they never came  Nothing was done until I went to the front desk and spoke to them sternly and even then they only gave us gift certificates for room service  It is a very nice hotel but the staff treated us badly  
N => Newly Remodeled Rooms We booked this room off a website named our own price and got it for  a night plus tax  We got  rooms  Check in took a bit long but the woman checking us in was trying to find connecting rooms so I didnt mind at all  We got joining rooms on the th floor both rooms had  double beds  We got the rooms that have been recently reated thankfully I stayed here  years ago and the rooms were really outdated so this was a BIG improvement  The rooms are a bit small but you dont notice it due to the orating  I dont know how to put it into words but the rooms were just nice They are something that you would want in your own home  It doesnt really feel like a hotel at all  The bathrooms were also nice  Both were different sizes though  I took picture of both so you can see the difference  But again its not that major of a deal Checking out and getting the cars from valet was my only problem with the service  The other room had checked out earlier and gone to get their car first and called up  minutes later telling us to call before you get down here because it takes forever to get the cars  So I checked us out and called the extension on the valet ticket  The person on the other line told me that I had to go to the front desk to have the ticket validated before they can get the car  Ok so I went to the front desk and when I got up to the desk and explained the quotsituationquot the woman behind the desk just looked at me confused  Then she asked for the ticket number and said that the vehicle has already been picked up    hmmm  After a couple of questions and being totally confused by her she finally found out that the car has been called for when I origannly called for it in the first place  I walked away to wait for the car then Im still confused as to what happened and it still doesnt make sense but all in all it was a nice stay  Nobody was rude they just need to improve on communication  
N => No Broadband connection Chicago was mostly sold out the weekend I stopped so ended up here  On Exec floor room was good and bed very comfy bathroom small However Exec lounge dingy and no view outside  Valet parking worked well  However no broadband I was very surprised and disapointed  I thought all Hiltons had Internet  
N => A huge disappointment Dont waste your hard earned money here  Service is abysmal or rather non existent  The rooms are the size of prison cells and not clean  Garbage in our room when we checked in no coffee maker no doorman to help with bags or taxis manager hung up when we complained about the garbage in the room  Employees dont care about customers  Overall a huge disappointment  This is supposed to be a full service hotel but more like a motel  at night  Total rip off  
N => Wonderful Service Had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the Palmer House  The service was wonderful staff was very friendly towards dog owners even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was  Easy access to red line from Midway  Valets were prompt at retrieving car they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting  
N => Not what I expected Upon arriving at the Palmer House I was stunned at the rushed atmosphere  It took us a few minutes to get oriented with the lobby itself as there is a multitude of foot traffic going either direction at any given time  After finally arriving at the check in desk we were greeted rather impersonal  The man stayed on the phone the entire time he checked us in which I found to be not only rude to us but also to the people trying to carry on a conversation on the other end  We again had to reorientate as the lobby area was filled with quotcocktailersquot on business trips which did not bother me but did make it a bit difficult to navigate through with our bags  I will add that the ambiance on this level was absolutely spectacular  It definitely takes you back a century and is phenomenal to take in  We arrived on the th floor only to find that our room key didnt work  Had we not been on the El and carrying our bags with us it wouldnt have been so frustrating but we were worn out and ready to drop our bags shower and regroup  My husband left me with the bags and waited so patiently on the elevator that seemed to take FOREVER to reach our floor  Eventually he returned and it turned out that the gentleman at the front desk had assigned us the wrong room  Imagine my surprise   as he paid NO attention to what he was doing in the first place We got into our room and it was clean but not eclectic or modern in any way  Still the old TV  A ent sized bathroom  The room itself was very small but if youre only staying a couple of days then it is manageable  Dont expect the typical Chicago boutique experience in this hotel  Its hustle and bustle is at its best  Concierge is pleasant but not overly friendly  Efficiency seems key not friendliness  We did have cocktails apps and desserts in the hotel restaurant and really enjoyed those  We would only return if it was a great price that we couldnt beat  
N => Could do better We stayed in the Palmer House Hilton for  nights as part of our honeymoon trip  I had reserved a King Size room on the Executive floor  I had forgotten this at the time of checking in  When we checked in they said we were in a Queen  We asked if we could be moved to a King and they said no   the hotel was fully booked  Luggage up to room which was ok but the two Queen size beds seemed quite small  I found our reservation which specifically said King Size and my husband took this down to reception  Magically a King Size room appeared even though they claimed to be fully booked  No apology  No offer to send someone to help us move our bags  The King Size room was nice though and quite big  On the Executive Floor breakfast is included and it has its own area for breakfast  It is pretty poor  It was a free for all and nothing was replaced or topped up  I dont think the Executive floor is actually worth is because the service isnt any better than youd get in the rest of the hotel  We paid an had breakfast in the main restaurant the next morning and it was so much better  All in all it was ok but I expected much better  The hotel itself is nice but the service let it down  No one went out of their way to help and they seemed like they couldnt be bothered  
N => Super Location Great Service Good Price for Chicago My husband and I took the train to Chicago for Valentines Day and his birthday  We arrived before check in time but the friendly bellman told us to go ahead to registration as he was sure they would be able to put us in a room right away  We were so impressed by the magnificent lobby The woman at registration was very kind and found us a room  However when we unlocked the door another guest was standing there fortunately fully clothed he had arranged for a late departure but something had obviously been confused  Back down to registration we went and the same woman apologized profusely and bumped us up to a more expensive room in the towers for our trouble  The room was large although the original room we were to have was a good size too nicely orated and had the most comfortable bed Ive slept in outside of my own home  At this level breakfast was provided as well as a hearty afternoon buffet of munchies  We had a wonderful weekend and were within walking distance of the Art Institute great shopping and our choice of excellent restaurants  Whenever we needed a cab Palmer House employees were there to assist us  We were never treated with anything less than courtesy and consideration and look forward with pleasure to another visit  
N => Pleased with the Palmer House Reation in progress looks to be very nice  Our room appeared to be recently reated with superficial changes only in the bathroom  Room also lacked flat screen TV but was well appointed in a sort of homages to the s  Cant complain about the service  
N => Don t count on service We booked the hotel with Southwest vacations The hotel is beautiful and nicely located The rooms are moderns the bathroom are a bit small The worst experience was the noise you can hear everything that is happening in the hallway We got to change room cause ours was right in front of the elevators and we could hear people chatting and coming back at am   Checking was very long and not pleasant only one person was attending a line of  people   Even though they changed our room we had to make numerous calls to get it done our luggage was moved and our key disconnected without us being notified spent another half an hour at front desk to find out what was our new room Service is definitly average and rude 
N => Great Location Beautiful Well Taken Care of We booked this room through Hotwire always unsure of what to expect  But we were pleasantly surprised The location was outstanding close to the Lake close to shopping within walking distance of everything  Not to mention the train stop is right there  The room was a bit small but not too bad for a  night stay  The front desk was a bit hasty with working with us on the accomodations but we expected that due to booking through Hotwire  We also had a problem with obtaining the free toiletries but it all worked out in the end  Overall I would DEFINITELY stay here again and will suggest to all my friends  Athough beware of the prices of the drinks at the bar in the lobby    for two vodkatonics  EEK 
N => Staying somewhere else next time  Something always seems to go wrong when I visit Chicago last time our car got towed at am course our luggage maps amp most  was in the car  so we had to wander the streets of Chicago aimlessly   This time the issue was the hotelPlus  star locationPlus  star gorgeous lobby historical hotelMinus  star  for PAPER THIN WALLSMinus  star  for being woken by maid each morningMinus  star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working amp not being helpful to him in any way I have travelled throughout the US Europe amp Asia and I dont remember any hotel motel or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least am  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help FRI am Maid service next door to those that flew in late amp are on CA time that felt like am about  hours BEFORE I had planned to wake  Were not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum were talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together     thats how thin the walls were I crawled out of bed amp put a quotdo not disturbquot sign up  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someones rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning    Id have to say she didnt read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex SAT Maid service comes through at am which to someone on PST felt like am wakeup esp  after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before  SUN  am woken by screaming fight next door apparently some jerk ditched his GF  am woken up by someone in the room on the other side ided it was a good time to SING  am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning wed finally learned to put the do not disturb or polish our door sign up at night Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago  Get a call from my BF  His card wont work on the room He went to the front desk amp since his name wasnt on the reservation they wouldnt give him a new card Fair enough appreciate their not giving one to just anyone  What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him I mean he did have a hotel card he knew the name of the person in the room he knew the room   he could describe the room amp our luggage offered to give them the credit card   the room was charged too   he wasnt just coming in randomly amp fishing for info They told him having me call amp verify him would NOT be enough to let him in He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didnt work  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room   amp name associated with the card  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didnt work and that his belongings were really in the room So he called me upset that he wasnt allowed in our room he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least  hours and was at least an hour away I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in   but it definitely soured our afternoon Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived amp cranky about the above instances The front of the building is under construction which is a shame wouldve liked to see it  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address they gave me the street that had no entrance instead of the street that had a working entrance  They have a big read note about the POOL being closed but no mention of the front door not being there And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport not knowing there were arate trainnon train lines so instead of giving us the stop  feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport   I was told to get out at a stop about  blocks away    still deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line probably wants the closest Orange line stop not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop amp then toting luggage to the hotel  
N => Disappointed Kind of a let down for a Hilton    we rented two connecting rooms and were surprised to find a broken ironing board that would not stay up a door knob falling off of the closet a shower that had barely enough pressure to rinse a toilet that constantly drained and filled not to mention no coffee maker We have stayed in a lot of Hiltons and would not stay here again  A beautiful lobby and pleasant staff    just sub standard room features  
N => We really enjoyed the Palmer House My wife and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for our nd anniversary a couple or weeks ago  We booked it on Priceline after reading a number of bad reviews we were worried about our stay  When we arrived the valet parking was very convenient and the people were friendly  The bell hops were very helpfull  Coming up the escalator we were in awe at the beautiful lobby and the check in went very smooth  Got to our room worried it was going to be tiny it wasnt accually it was a nice size not a suite but nice  Beds very comfortable the or was nice with granite countertops  It must of been one of the remodeled rooms  We only stayed a short time but were very happy with it  Awesome location close to everything  All and all very nice stay  The only reason that we gave it a  stars instead or  was there was no breakfeast and there was an additional charge to use some of the hotel featuresfitness center 
N => Overpriced Overrated Over the top Booked through Hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage  The view was of the inner courtyard of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms  You were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night They no longer have in room coffee appliances  You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonalds Internet access is not free   hours the quotGift Shopquot is a joke tucked away in the corner of the coat check room Concierge services have limited hours and the business center is open only during business hours which made it difficult to get work done after business hours quotI would not stay there ever again nor do I recommend it to anyone  I have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express 
N => Wonderful Old Hotel I travel quite a bit for pleasure and business and have stayed at many hotels worldwide  Some were advertised as  star properties and I think that was because you could see  stars through the ceiling  Not this place it was well worth the price  I like to read the reviews on where Im staying just to see what Im getting into before I get there  And based on the reviews from here Ive only requested to change hotels once and that was in Sicily  Reading the reveiws you have to take the good with the bad and make your own ision  I was going to be spending  days at this hotel for a conference I was attending at their sister hotel The Chicago Hilton and read the reviews on this hotel at the airport before I left and wasnt sure what to expect  quotsmall roomsquot quotin the middle of reationquot quotnot worth itquot quotable to turn the TV off with my foot from my bedquot  Well I was very surprised  I had no trouble checking in and was given a room that was beyond my expectations It was huge and at the end of a hallway  Yes you could hear doors closing in the hall and voices in the next room but hey youre in a hotel not your own home  I thought the place was beautiful  The lobby was unbelievable and the overall energy of the place was comforting  I didnt try any of the restaurants since I prefer to seek out more neighborhood places of which I found many  Millers Pub right next door was especially good    It was very centrally located and well within walking distance to many attractions like the Sears Tower Navy Pier The Miracle Mile and much more  From Navy Pier I would recommend a river tour pointing out the architecture of the buildings along the river  My only issue would be not having coffee makers in rooms and the having to pay for internet access but if those are my only complaints the I think the hotel is well worth the price they charge  
N => Very Pleased With Our Stay It is funny to see the wide range of reviews   We booked via Priceline and were quite happy  We arrived very late yet they were able to accomodate our request for a king bed  The room was dated but this is a  year old hotel   I would have been dissapointed if it was ultra modern  What some see at dated others see as charming The room was very comfy quiet and fairly large  The location was perfect    blocks from the lake and right next to the Adams street subway  We overlooked the quotLquot on Wabash but never ever heard any street noise  The lobby was fantastic and there was an energy in the hotel which was fun to experience If I had any complaints they were minor   no coffee machine in the room nor wireless internet but these both get back to that charrming vs dated view   Also one of the  elevators that reached the th floor was out of commission   so the waits were a bit longer than normal The Palmer House was billed as a  star   and we concur  
N => Grand Lobby but Poor Rooms The lobby was very nice and the food was above average but the room was very small and the air conditioning did not work  The walls were very thin I could hear every conversation taking place in the halls and adjoining rooms  The valet and bell service took approximately  minutes at check in and check out  I tipped the bellman while I was waiting for my vehicle which was a mistake because he left while I was still waiting  I would recommend the Swissotel better prices better service and bigger air conditioned rooms  
N => Customer Satisfaction Beyond Expectations We got an excellent rate through Hotwire and were given a large refurbished room  After dropping off our luggage we headed out for dinner and a show at the Chicago Theatre  Upon our return we realized there was a noisy gathering in the room next to ours  Around midnight we called down to the front desk  They offered to send up Security but we chose to switch rooms instead  They sent a bellman up with keys for the new accommodations and to assist us with our transition  I was afraid that they might give us a lesser room because of our complaint  Instead they provided us with a corner suite with a living room dining room wet bar bedroom two bathrooms and two plasma TVs  As you can imagine we were totally delighted 
N => Thin walls could hear neighbors The lobby is hopping with mingling people most hours the or is s  I am a Sinatra fan and was happy to see Pictures of all the famous people who played at the Empire Room in the s and on  At first glance my husband and I were very happy with our hotel pick until being woken up at AM in the morning after a prior busy day of sight seeing  We were woken up by a beeping sound that sounded like it was coming from our room  I thought be the alarm was on from the previous guests  After investigating this annoying beeping sound we realized it was our neighbors alarm  Then we fell back asleep for about  minutes until he turned his TV on and it sounded like it was in our room  You could hear every word very clearly  I called down to the front desk and they said they would tell security  We ided to then ask if they had a room that was not next to anyone and they said they were full but they could move us  So at  Am on our vacation we packed up all of our belongings to switch rooms  We were sent a few floors up to an end unit into a smaller king room  In this room you could hear every word of the family next to us  These were the thinnest walls of any hotel room we have ever stayed in and we are not hotel snobs we have stayed in the best and the worst of rooms  When we come back to Chicago we would rather stay some where else  
N => A pleasant stay in a historic hotel My wife and I stayed for  nights and loved it  Our stay was booked for us by Virgin Atlantic when we booked our flights from London to Chicago  We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name  In the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel On arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient  The interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the or as it would have been when it was built  The room we were given was a good size with  Queen bed which was particularly comfortable The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby  The first night we ate at the hotels own gourmet restaurant The Lockwood which did not disappoint  The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant  We had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered Generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful  A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving  A member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money  
N => Fabulous hotel and service Wanted to stay downtown and the Peninsula was perfect  The room and view were fantastic  The service was impeccable  Every employee you passed genuinely greeted you  The management here clearly does a wonderful job  The only thing I would point out was that I emailed the concierge prior to my arrival for restaurant recommendations and noone ever responded back  Other than that the stay was absolutely amazing  
N => good chicago hotel at the right price We normally stay at another competitor in Chicago  There was an unusually good special so we ided to try the Peninsula  We had a  BD suite  Views in this hotel are not as good as the FS where we we usually stay but we did have a nice view of Water Tower and a little bit of the lake  Main bathroom is a little small suite had low ceilings and the TV was outdated  Our mini bar was not refilled during our stay once    no diet sodas after the first day  The restaurants were empty or having special events during our stay so even though we were offered a discount we could not use it and try them  Hotel was nice enough to credit toward the stay  Concierges were very good at getting basic info though they push the restaurant of a former chef that we thought was a poor suggestion  The bar is old school but really smells of smoke even though it is non smoking  The pool spa is nice  The location is central Michigan Ave near the major dept  stores  I would return only if I found a great deal again  
N => Beautiful but exorbitantly expensive I stayed at The Peninsula for three nights in ust  The room was on the th floor somewhat near the elevator but wonderfully quiet and luxurious  The staff were exceedingly polite but forgot to retrieve the room service cart sometimes for hours  Having to take two elevators to get to my room was a bit of a hassle as well  The room service food and the food in the Lobby was not worth the money  dont eat in the hotel go elsewhere  Extremely expensive  but if its no object and you want a gorgeous quiet and comfortable room then go for it  
N => impeccable everything was great food room service concierge  i would definately recommend it  
N => loved the Peninsula Wonderful stay pure luxury excellent service we will go back 
N => Best Hotel Experience Ever We had a great time staying at this hotel  From the concierge service to the Laundry service to management everybody is just so kind and wonderful  Everything was perfectly timely and arranged in detailed to please the customers  The Hotel has an excelent Buffet that serves breakfast and lunch  What a variety of delicious food Love it We had a problem with our Limo service which had a miss schedule out pick up time and the hotel manager called the company and had limo picked us up in  minutes  Just in time so we did not missed the fly back home We would move to live at the Peninsula if we could afford it all year round 
N => Nice but a little dated and problems with the electrical systems I have heard great things about this hotel so I was a little disappointed with conditions on my stay  We were in Room  an executive suite  Here are the pros Location is excellent  you cant beat it  Right off of Mag Mile  Service is excellent  Friendly staff we got an upgrade when we checked in  Courteous prompt attention the whole time  When we checked in we had a little fruitnut plate waiting for us and they brought us welcome green tea within  hour of check in  That was a nice touch  Suite size was great  Laid out well lots of room and it had my favorite thing  a bathtub with a giant window above it  They gave us a late check out of pm which was awesome  Here are the cons The or is a little dated and worn  The carpet in our room had what at first looked like a huge water stain running down the hall upon closer inspection was a tread path from overuse  The very complicated lighting system did not work  There are panels all over the room to control lights and other systems and they malfunctioned the whole time  Which meant that when we tried to go to sleep that night we could NOT TURN THE LIGHTS OFF  We had to call maintenance  To their credit they sent someone up right away to reset  However the problem continued throughout the night with the lights going on and off as we were sleeping  Yeah REALLY annoying  Luckily I had a couple cocktails hey it was Bluesfest so I was able to go back to sleep each time  We told the staff when we were checking out about the problem  They were nice enough and told us that they were in the middle of a quotgreen updatequot right right that was causing the problems  I just feel like for  a night the lights should work in the room no 
N => Great spa great Shanghai Terrace restaurant Everything else was booked so I ended up in the Peninsula  Mostly stayed in the Swissotel before but P  is definitely much better and pricier  Got a room upgrade to a huge suite which was awesome so I cant say much about the standard room  Room was somehow cold and heatingAC system did not seem to respond to my manipulations at the command center included in bedsite telephone  Knobs at drawers come off yes the shower door does not really stay closed but who cares  Spa is awesome nice pool book a massage if you have time  We ate at the truly amazing Shanghai Terrace inhouse  My guest who likes to eat very well was blown away  Upon check out there was a minor problem with the fact that the breakfast had not yet been charged to the room and the receptionist had to use persuasive language to get this done  And yes she was rather rude  Does not fit in this hotel Room was absolutely quiet which is a nice change from a lot of hotels Swissotel with the rambling elevators can make sleep impossible I would not pay the price out of my own pocket but on someone elses credit card   why not  
N => Very disappointing and not worth the price My husband and I booked a  Executive Suite for a birthday weekend  A person from the hotel called last week to ask our newspaper drink fruit and housekeeping preferences  Nice touch right Well we thought so too until we arrived and the front desk asked us the questions again  Unfortunately none of our preferences were acknowledged at any time during our stay  Why ask if youre not going to attempt themWe checked in at the front desk and were truly taken aback by the rudest most short tempered front desk person we have ever encountered  It really surprised us how someone like this could be checking in guests at such a nice hotel  It made such a poor first impression  My husband   whose ears were still stuffy from the plane   asked twice on what floor was the fitness center located  The second time she answered she huffed and snapped at my husband  It was a very unsettling experience Our suite was okay but not great  The furniture was very scratched up  The outdated TVs had very poor pictures  The phones were also very outdated and one did not work  We had to call for housekeeping  times on Saturday  We received half a newspaper on Sunday they are placed inside a locked box so we knew it was delivered that way The suite did not meaure up to its price hype or reputation We thought the location was good   but saw many other luxury hotels in the same location  The bed was comfy and room service was good  We will not stay at The Peninsula when we visit Chicago in the future  We strongly suggest you stay somewhere else  
N => Disappointing be my expectations were too high but I must say that I was very disappointed in my stay at this hotel  My trip was relative to three days in Chicago on business and was booked by my company  Finding out I was staying at the Peninsula seemed like quite a treat but I wont be back  The hallways and rooms are looking worn surprising for a hotel of this caliber and service was average at best  Also upon getting to my room it had a very odd smell to it     I even double checked to insure I was in a non smoking room  As I went into the bathroom to unpack there was a used tissue used towel used soap and water all on the bathroom counter  Also it was obvious that the toilet had been used  All I can come up with is that someone else had checked in ided not to deal with the odor and checked out of the room however no one took the time to clean it or even double check what the previous guest possibly had done to the room  When I called the front desk I was immediately moved to another room but it kind of set the tone for my visit I have enjoyed stays at other Chicago hotels much more and I know they did not charge what The Peninsula does  While I  be back on business I would never book this hotel on my own  
N => Second visit   consistant high quality This was my second stay at the hotel  This time I came for a get a way weekend with my wife to celebrate our anniversary  The location was great and the room was excellent  Check in was quick and flawless  The front desk confirmed all of our dinner reservations booked via concierge reservations were for both in and outside of the hotel  The hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries for our special occassion  Prior to our arrival my wife ordered Congac and cigars to surprise me  She was a little upset that they were not in the room upon arrival as she had requested and confirmed  The room was very comfortable  The bed was incredible   wxtremely comfortable There was plenty of closet space and a large well appointed bathroom  The room was service was excellent  Every time we ordered  a least once a day we were quoted a time of arrival  They arrived almost to the minute from the time we were quoted I dont know how they do that unless they are waiting outside our room and knocking right at the quoted time  Finally the staff treated us like movie stars  Everyone remembered our names and always asked how our dinner reservations turned out the previous evening  We truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel to couples  
N => Tired room and weak spa  We had high hopes for our stay but were disappointed  First we booked a deluxe superior room the view of an exterior wall of an adjoining building left something to be desired  I turned on the water in the sink and it started filling up with water  I pushed the lever down to open the drain and the entire lever came off in my hand and something metal dropped to the floor  Next my wife took a shower and the shower door would not stay closed  Needless to say it was surprising to find that things were broken and not working properly in our room The next morning I went to the spa and BOTH the steam room and the whirlpool were broken  While in the pool area I spoke with a fellow guest who stated that while using the hair dryer in his room he received a rather large electrical shock  The management offered to take   off his bill On the whole the Peninsula was a nice hotel but they need to work harder at keeping the mechanical elements working  
N => Swanky lovely hotel The women in my family stayed at the Peninsula for three nights in ust   We had three rooms adjacent to each other one with a Bed and Breakfast package  Two of our rooms were ready at check in time but the third was not ready even an hour later  We found out that a prior guest had smoked in the room and they were trying to air it out  It never did air out over our stay  To the credit of the hotel they did offer to move us on our second day but we lined because of the hassle factor  Otherwise check in was the low point of our stay  The person that checked me in seemed to not know what to ask me how to print out the check in card and never asked me questions about newspaper preferences food allergies etc  that the others in my party were asked  The woman who checked in my mother was downright rude talking down to her in an insulting way  We believe she is the assistant manager but we arent sure  This did not start our stay off well especially when we found out her room was the one that had been smoked in  Actually the main level with the restaurants check in and concierge always reeked of smoke  We wondered if there was a cigar bar in the hotel  A good reason to ban smoking in all public areas of hotels in our opinion Other than this worrisome beginning the rest of the stay was great  We loved the rooms   regal warm or a stupendous bathroom great ac during a very hot time and staff that catered to our many requests prompty and graciously  Softest sheets ever and large thirsty towels    heavenWe had a number of treatments in the spa all great  The facilities were top notch and very clean We had afternoon tea the day we arrived and it was lovely  However the breakfast package proved to be a bust  Their breakfast menu is fairly limited and the food was outrageously expensive  I dont mind paying  per person for breakfast but I want a lot of choices served promptly  Service was uniformly slow in the Dining Room although waiting in such a grand space was not the worst thing in the worldIt is hard to ide if the experience was worth the price we paid  I have stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Four Seasons and I found this experience on par although more pricey  I dont think we would go back to the Peninsula especially with the opening of a Mandarin Oriental and a Shangri La property in Chicago in the near future  I think we would try these other properties especially if their rates are competitive  
N => Thats why you choose the Peninsula Fabulously professional service and elegant rooms  Some of the room electronics and televisions could be updated but its even a stretch to find fault with that  Perfect business stay  
N => Expensive dowdy rooms a downer despite service location Dowdy rooms but very good service  Good location but there are nearby hotels also with excellent service for much less money  I cant get over how the rooms are rather blah compared to other four and five star hotels  
N => Poor service It took  minutes to check in    not fun with our two children  Then they told us that the room we booked was not available  We had written confirmation of our reservation and showed it to them  First they said it was a computer error then they changed the story to something else  They said that in any event they didnt have any rooms available except a small single room with one king bed    certainly not sufficient for the  of us We spoke with the manager and then that persons manager and they wouldnt do anything except see if they could squeeze in a cot in the small room admitting that at best it would be a tight fit  I explained that Ive stayed at many nice hotels and that if this happened at for example a iott then they would give us an upgrade  He pretended to type something into the computer and then told me that no upgraded rooms were available  I then had a friend call and reserve a small suite for the same night  Lo and behold my friend was able to get us into the suite that he paid for  Unbelievable  
N => Not worth it Overall our stay was just okay  The room we reserved was not available so they offered an upgrade but honestly the upgraded room small suite was cramped and was definitely not as open as our double deluxe room wouldve been  I thought the bathroom was nice but that alone was not worth the  room rate  I did have a couple of issues the main issue being that the breakfast we ordered via room service was terrible  I actually had to send it back because the eggs were completely overcooked the ham was rubbery from sitting in the warmer too long and the english muffin was completely cold and untoasted  Overall we were disappointed and have had much better experiences at  star hotels like The Ritz and  stars like Westin hotels  
N => Personal service but no wow factor  Yes The Peninsula offers a very personal touch to staying at a hotel but we were not quotwowedquot by our overall experience After checking in we arrived in our room and were greeted by mood lighting and soft music about  minutes later we received a complimentary plate of fruit for our first time staying here Our Superior King Guestroom was nice and inviting but nothing we havent had before at other hotels We did not use the spa but we did use their workout room  It offers a great view from the treadmills looking out towards Lake Michigan or Michigan Avenue and a small assortment of weight machines  Headsets and bottled water are also available  The rooftop lounge area only has enough chairs for about  people so get your seat early if you want to soak up the sun The chocolate buffet on Saturday night offers a large table full of chocolate treats but we found most of them dry and bland  Hardly worth the  per person We booked this hotel for a weekend getaway and enjoyed the location but we will not be returning next year  
N => I will never look at another hotel the same again I have to disagree with the previous post about the Peninsula being unfriendly toward African Americans  I took my husband there in ust as a birthday surprise and I am still recovering from the extreme pampering and luxury  The staff was very accomodating and everyone went out of their way to make sure we had an enjoyable stay  My husband and I who are both African American checked into the Peninsula at around  in the afternoon  Not only was our room ready we were also offered a complimentary room upgrade  The room was unlike anything I had ever experienced  We had tea in the Lobby that afternoon  Everything was delicious and the service was impeccable  We were seated immediately and the wait staff was attentive  I couldnt have asked for a better experience  As a matter of fact there was a table with about  African American women having tea right next to us  Later that night my husband and I wanted dinner from Grand Lux Cafe but we were too lazy to walk there  I called the concierge and she sent someone out to pick up our food for us and deliver it to our room  I didnt see or experience any discrimination at all during my stay and I plan to go back often  
N => A bit disappointed The Peninsula was clearly a very nice  star hotel  But I was hoping that for the price it would be the best in town  I have also stayed at the Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt  I think the Park Hyatt is a little more hip more of a place to take your spouse on a romantic urban weekend  The Four Seasons is superior in terms of service  I had some difficulty with the concierge at the Peninsula  Nothing major but despite a request and an assurance of an early check in we had to wait a couple of hours to check into our room which was especially inconvenient since we were traveling with our  year old son  Also there was a mix up with dinner reservations that were not confirmed  I also purchased a special package for our son the quotPeninsula Kidsquot or something  It included a backpack and some goodies for kids  The backpack was so cheap we left it in the room and I would not recommend it  It would be better to just order room service treats for the kiddos  The good news The hotel was very accomodating to children  The babysitter service was wonderful  And the room service menu was excellent  They had a huge menu for children which was wonderful  The rest of the food was good but insanely expensive  I usually dont bat an eye at expensive food but it was pricey even by my standards  The bathrooms were awesome with the flat screen television in the tub  Next time I will probably stay at the Four Seasons again  
N => Absolutely Wonderful We went to Chicago for a wedding and chose the Peninsula after struggling through numerous recommedations and reviews on Trip Advisor  I have to say we made an excellent choice our room ior suite was spacious the beds were comfortable although not a heavenly bed the at your fingertips in room gadgets were great as well  The living area was actually very comfortable which is in contrast to most hotel living areas e g  the sofa was soft comfortable not hard and rigid My only negative experience was with a gentleman on the concierge staff   on Sunday we wanted a nice brunch spot he recommended the same places the day before and upon pointing it out to him he seemed frustrated and asked me to then tell me what it is you want in a less than pleasant tone  I ended up telling him to forget it and walking out  be I am too idealistic but he should have gone out of his way  I realize they are busy but this is his job  On the flip side we encountered many other eager and helpful staff members  I highly recommend this hotel however you should book any spa appointments well in advance as they fill up quickly  
N => Pure Heaven We stayed here for two nights our wedding night and one more  You would have to pry us out of the room because we didnt want to leave We were pleased to find an upgrade and waiting for us in the room was champagne chocolate covered strawberries and Blackout cake we requested from the Cheesecake Factory that we were not charged for  The room itself was stunning and we couldnt believe the door bell lighting system and master bath bigger than our livingroom in our apartment  The concierge was able to make us a dinner reservation and when we arrived I overheard them on the phone saying they were booked and arrange a car to take us home which ended up being a stretch limousine  Everything about the hotel was classy and wonderful yet warm and friendly  We are hoping to save up enough to make it back next year 
N => Beyond our expectations Several days prior to arriving at the Peninsula I called the concierge to arrange reservations for restaurants and clubs during our stay  Mee Mee at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in pulling it all together  Her recommendations were terrific  She was able to get us tickets to Buddy Guys blues club even though it was sold out for a special tribute night  The show was amazing  We were celebrating our anniversary and upon arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded from a standard room to a ior Suite  We we got to the room and there was a champagne bucket and chocalate covered strawberries waiting for us  The Peninsula is the only hotel I have ever stayed at where the person checking you in at the front desk actually escorts you to your room  The attention to detail in the rooms is apparent  Unlike the previous review our bed was wonderful  The electronic console by the bed allows you to change the temperature lighting adjust the music turn on the privacy at the door etc     This is unique to the Peninsula and a real fun feature  The rooms are set up with mood lighting and at the flip of a switch you are in romance heaven  Individual reading lights at the bed allow each person to either be reading or fast asleep  We never ate in the hotel other than the complimentary continental breakfast each morning which if we had to pay it would have been day  Location couldnt be better  If you are looking for over the top views look somewhere else  I am sure that there are rooms with better views than ours but in general this is not a quotviewquot property  Good storage in a room is important to my wife and she says there was more than ample drawers and closet storage space  Housekeeping was phenomenal Absolutely  star all the way  Again attention to detail is very apparent  It was clear the room was tidied extremely well twice a day  The bathroom was fully equiped and functional although a bit tight  However the private comod and the glass enclosed shower were  star  The tub was too big for my wife and she was uncomfortable sliding around  A peninsula tub pillow would have be solved this problem  We could have settled in for longer but our  nights were perfect  This hotel is exceptional  Service attention to detail super quality linens towels wireless internet at no charge on and on  We have  children and we left them att home this trip  We probably would not bring them to the Peninsula as the other clientel might not appreciate them  However Peninsula has just started a kids program which shows their willingness to enter this arena  All in all this is an outstanding  star property and I would highly recommend it to those who want a great Mag  Mile location with outstanding service and amenities Look for a full Chicago Trip Report upcoming in the Chicago forum  
N => Great room and service but almost fainted at the brunch bill Having stayed at the other five star hotels in Chicago I was pleasantly surprised that this hotel surpassed the others  Rooms were wonderful and sumputous and the service was outstanding  I had requested early check in and was told they would try but they could not garauntee it  A perfectly appropriate response  We arrived at  pm with normal check in at  pm and our room was not ready  They asked us to wait in the barlobby area and enjoy drinks on the house  They make a great  tini  We received a call on my cell phone and told that they had an upgraded suite available if we would accept it  We had the Penn Kids package for our son and he loved the goodie filled backpack as well as his own personal business cards  He also enjoyed the kid friendly snacks delivered to the room gummy worms popcorn milk and cookies  We loved the Sunday brunch especially because they had a whole table of kid friendly food for our picky eater  The only surprise came when we got the bill  For two adults and one child our bill was   I admit that I had two glasses of champagne but I thought it was included in the meal price  That alone raised the bill by   Not that were piching pennies but I do like to make informed choices  There is no menu no pricing info available and I didnt feel comfortable asking about the cost of the brunch  Everything else was top notch well just go out for breakfast when we stay there again next week  
N => Tea at the Lobby was a delightful experience I had a tea with  other women to celebrate my dhters th birthday on ust    It was an absolutely wonderful experience for all of us  The service was impeccable and friendly  The tea was served beautifully and the food was very fresh and well prepared  My dhter was presented with a piece of cake that was served on a plate that said Happy Birthday Kristen in chocolate There was a candle in the cake  This was a very nice surprise  After tea we all went to the Bar and had the same wonderful friendly service  Thanks for helping us to have a great afternoon with you  
N => Dont Mean to Rain on the Parade Me and my girlfriends had reservations at quotThe Lobbyquot at the Peninsula Hotel this past Friday  I made reservations over  weeks in advance and called the day of to confirm and everything was fine  When we arrived downstairs at the hotel the service was impeccable and everything was great until we arrived at the lobby on the th floor  From the MOMENT Johanna our quothostessquot greeted us we sensed that we were not welcome  Not a hello not a quotWelcome to the Peninsulaquot nothing this woman walked up to us clapped her hands and stared as to infer quothow can I help youquot I stated that we had reservations and she said quotLet me checkquot  After waiting for about  minutes I glanced over to the reservations booth where I noticed Johanna and another girl pulling a sheet out of the reservations book and putting it into the lower cubicle removing another blank sheet putting it in the binder and flipping it back and forth as to infer that they did not see us listed  After the cht me staring at them Johanna walked over and said our table would be ready in a minute obliterating the necessity of our reservation We were seated and ordered our tea which was not allowed to steep and our Tea Refreshments were stale and took an additional  minute to arrive to our table  Not to mention the not so subtle stares we were recieving from the patrons  I couldnt help but wonder if quotThe Lobbyquot was used to having African American patrons since we were the ONLY blacks in the whole room save a bus boy who  minutes later turned into a waiter and was serving the people next to us  I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life and I am appalled at the shabby service we received  I will NEVER go back and I strongly encourage non WASPs to do the same  
N => As long as you dont have the Sunday Brunch      
N => From an Asian couple They welcomed us     
N => Incredible Facility OK Service   
N => Worth every penny  
N => I think they discriminated against me  
N => Ruff around the Edges No way this is a  star Its   and earlier this morning I gladly checked out of your establishment  I could not wait until I arrived home to e mail my un satisfactory experience at the hotel  Upon arrival I was so so greeted by the front desk ladies  It seemed through there facial expressions that I might have been bothering them   I also made the mistake of booking through priceline   I was giving the keys to my room and when I opened the door my first impression was of a tiny little box  Im a big guy and I need space  It had a dusty feel and I thought the ceiling tile was going to fall upon my head  Visually it was not very nice  I figured I would let that slide because all I was doing there was sleeping  Yet the more I looked at it the worse it got  I could go on and on about how I will never come back to the Nickerbocker  
N =>  th checked out  th Extremely Pleased I must admit I was skeptical after reading reviews on the internet  At that time the hotel was undergoing mass reation and people were complaining about bad plumbing noise etc  One comment was Do Not get a room by the elevator  Paper thin walls  We had a room by the elevator not noisy at all Yeah The staff was very friendly and accommodating  The rooms we rented  were sooooo pretty and comfy  Small bathrooms but very clean and well staffed every single day The consairs went way beyond the call of duty to make our stay interesting  Even took us into the Crystal Room that had been booked for a wedding to show us its magnificence  We were sooo impressed  Some of our best pictures of the Hotel are of this room  Showed our girls the secret passage way used by gangsters in days gone by  They loved that 
N => Not so good The lobby of hotel ok nice clean ok  Had room  double beds was nice size  Bathroom EXTREMELY SMALL also on the dingy side  Clean but just not want you want in a hotel  furnishings victiorian like  All amp all ok but we stay in Chicago alot amp wouldnt stay again only stayed due to great rate for a wedding we attended  Many other nicer hotels along michighan ave to stay  
N => Knickerbocker made my Knees Knock with Frustration Good location  Everything else was not positive  I was part of a large group and many people were extremely upset with the size of their rooms and bathrooms  Unusual room or pleased some was hated by others  Uncomfortable furniture  Food was not bad but expenive and serving times limited  Confirm your reservation prior to arrival to make sure they do indeed have a room for you for the correct date  Front desk staff was the worst part of a not so good stay  Requests to have things fixed were ignored until repeated numerous times and a scheduled wake up call was not made The good news I suppose is that almost all the problems cited COULD be turned around with attention from management   
N => Prime Gold Coast Retreat My wife amp I celebrated our anniversary at the Knickerbocker amp could not have been treated better  Before we were out of our cab our bags had been loaded on a cart amp we were walked into the hotel by a doorman  The rooms were well appointed amp the entire hotel staff was very friendly  This is a prime location for shopping sightseeing or nightlife   
N => Definitely not a  star hotel We booked the Knickerbocker through Priceline and we saved about  from the next best deal on a  star hotel  After reading the reviews we were a little worried  We automatically asked for a larger room when we arrived  They upgraded us to a quot quot larger room for an additional night It was fine but knowing this was the quotbiggerquot room the other rooms must have been a closet  The public areas were fine  The rooms and hallways were older and in need of reation  It looked like there must be  coats of paint on the molding aside from the poor workmanship  Behind the industrial style toilet were yellow water stains all over the wall  There was a pedestal sink with   thin glass shelves to put your things on hoping they wouldnt fall into the toilet  The bathroom was only about   ft  x  ft  including the tub area  As far as the paper thin walls I was awoken  times one night by people talking at a normal tone in the hall and our neighbors using speaker phone to call downstairs although their phone was not turned up loudly  I could actually easily make every word out that was spoken  The last day the shower water turned brown and left us with dirty feeling hair and black soot in the tub  When we filled the sink we realized it too was brown  We took pictures on our camera and showed the front desk  They said quotwere very sorryquot and that was it  No offer to try to make things better or anything  I think a ent  star hotel would at least make sure you had clean water or do something to try to make it right  I dont have a clue how this got its  star rating but I would not recommend it staying here  It is an ok location but we felt that the riott the Omni either one or the Westin were all better locations  This is one hotel that is living off yesterdays fame  
N => Good Place Stayed at this hotel   Very nice clean staff was friendly  Close to shopping areas  Nice tini bar 
N => Not what I expected but not horrible I stayed at the Knickerbocker on      I got a great price off hotwire night  I was expecting this super deluxe room with all the trimmings but I got an pretty ok double room i asked for a queen which they said they ran out of availability with no dresser and a teeny bathroom with no tub  Now Im from NYC so I know a small bathroom and I can do cartwheels in mine at home compared to this one  I could barely function in that bathroom without having to shut the door to give more space  But overall the service was good  I slept pretty comfortably  I dont think I would go to the Knickerbocker again just because I expected more  But its not a terrible hotel be just not a full  stars  
N => Definitely not  stars Even though parts of this hotel are relatively nice it appears they ran out of money to complete the reations  The rooms are small the furniture is ok the bathrooms are very small the tub was old the hallway was a bit run down  Overall I would rate this hotel a maximum  stars  
N => Better than Home  
N => Not again here either  
N => Not Again  
N => I Cant Wait To Return  
N => Great place to stay   
N => Bates Motel Ive stayed at some run down places all over the world but this place takes the cake  First off it is a brothel and filled with methcrack heads  I have no idea how this place passes any inspections  I was going to a couple of shows at the Congress theater and this place is the closest place to it so I thought Id try it out even though the reviews were bad  When we first walked in we had to talk to a guy behind a window and pay then we were buzzed though another door where we had to go up stairs battling crack heads on the way up  When I got to my room I looked around and found out that I was sharing a bathroom with the room next door which had some shady charactars in it  I would have never trusted my belongings in my room with only a plywood door between us  Then I sat on the bed and realized it was covered in plastic sheets under the covers  I looked at the plastic sheets and they were plastic wrap with duct tape  The sheets were also full of awsome yellow stains  Luckily we were given a refund and did not have to stay otherwise I would probably not have been able to written this because I would have been kidnapped and sold into a lifetime of male erotic sexual slavery  
N => Well I wasnt murdered in the  minutes that I was there  We got into the lobby and two guys were in the reception enclosure area  One of the guys was wearing a heavy metal shirt that read psycho something  For a double room it was only  so we figured we are only staying the night so no big deal right So we got a room key and got buzzed into the hall way and ided to take the stairs to the th floor the elevator didnt look too safe  As we go up the stairs the combination of smells weird or and sounds led me to believe that there wasnt something quite right about this place  We finally got to our floor and ided we should at least try to look at the room  The room was  so we got to the door and there was evidence of the door being kicked in at some point  After a few minutes we were finally able to get the door to open  It only took a look into the tiny room to realize that i wasnt wanting any part in a horror movie that night  The room had a tiny bed in it and the linens probably hadnt been washed in the last few months  The room was very dirty and there was a small sink to the right that had ants crawling in it  The room was also about  degrees and had very stale air  There was a fan but no AC  I would have not been able to sleep there especially with my mind contemplating at what point the door was going to be kicked in again me awaiting the same fate of some other poor traveler  I would have rather taken my chances sleeping on the street this particular evening  
N => Not here This place looks more like a brothel than a hotel  The quotreceptionistquot has to see every person who is going to stay before give you the key  Once you get to the room is like a puzzle to open the door  Then the room is disgusting youll see the rep carpet with thousands of spots I didnt even use the bathroom afraid I would get quotsomethingquot  You could hear everything that was going on outside  We were out of there in three hours  We drove another  minutes up north and stay in a better place in the suburbs for the same price  
N => Worst experience EVER I travel a lot and stay in some pretty shady places but this one took the cake  Cockroaches everywhere smells nasty Mrs Roper receptionist doubles as brothel dirtiest hotel I have every seen broken doors old food that looked like a mix of cigarette butts and corn in the plant in front of our door fat shirtless white trash guy maintenance man with a knife on his belt no towel or soap in bathroom brown bloodstained shower  The guy who showed us our room asked if we were having a quotpartyquotWe checked out quicker than it took for us to check in and they wouldnt give us our money back until the boss showed up the next day so we had to take a special cab ride back to the place  We explained to the local Cab driver that we refused to stay there because we didnt want to wake up to someone with a knife over our bed  The cab driver said   quotif you stay there youre lucky if you even wake up at all Dont stay here  
N => Smack dab in the middle of it all Not fancy no frills   just what we needed to be frugal on a room where we spent barely a wink  Who spends time in your room in Chicago Everywhere we went we walked everywhere was within  mins Desk staff was helpful when asking questions  Perfect for people on a budget or wanting to spend money elsewhere in the city Not to mention   FREE parking 
N => Great Cheap Stay My sister and I went to Chicago on whim on the weekend just to get away from everyday life  We went to the Cultural Center asked for cheap places to stay in the heart of the city and this is one of the few options they gave us  We LOVED our stay here  It was simple cheap and right next to everything you would need to have fun in Chicago  There was really nothing grand about it but its really all you need  Gives you a place to rest your head park your car and not have to worry about anything but having fun which is what we had came to do  Thanks Ohio Motel for making our stay in Chicago that much better We will defiantly be back 
N => noisy room and safety concerns motel with ground and first floor only  I was on the ground floor and discovered during my stay that my bedroom windows were unlocked  As a solo female traveller this was not comforting to me neither were the two locks and a chain on my door  I slept very little due to feeling unsafe and due to what sounded like a generator machinery which i think was just under my room  This continued all night   They were unable to move me elsewhere  I was please to leave and I would not hurry back  Cheap compared to many other hotels etc in the area   be better for male travellers or groups 
N => Not Worth It We stayed at the Ohio House Motel two times  We thought we had found a reasonably priced clean motel that had free parking and was within walking distance of some nice restaurants and Michigan Avenue This last time turned out to be filled with problems     On a weekend the bar across the street is full of drunk people who sit outside in good weather and talk loudly all night last time I checked was  a m   It is extremely noisy    The television was stuck on Spanish  After we failed to adjust it the clerk pulled something on the back to fix it    Right after we paid the clerk immobilized our room key so we had to go back to the desk to get our remaining items from the room    BE SURE TO LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAINS AFTER YOU CHECK IN  Make sure the window is locked  Shortly after midnight I woke with a start to see a HAND REACHING INTO THE ROOM I screamed and the hand went away  It made me think of the Bates Motel in the movie Psycho  I can live the rest of my life without ever wanting to repeat that experience   No shampoo or amenities  Flat pillows and very thin sheets  And Clean Look under the bed 
N => Slum motel  degrees outside  degrees inside Even with the so called air conditioner on This room was apparently the only one available  we ended up with a room with two twin beds on wheels w dirty sheets  and they were both leaning inward and the head of the bed was much lower then the bottoms  We had no choice tho all other hotels were booked and it was late  We had planned a weekend stay but after one night stay we cancelled the rest of the weekend becauseI refused to stay another sleepless excruciatingly hot night here  After the Third Cold shower to cool down I realized that We also were not supplied with any of the normal bathroom amentities soap shampoo etc When i complained to the supposed manager about the heat of the room he blatantly ordered an  something year old housekeeping woman to quotlook intoquot it         puhlease           and in response she looked at me and exclaimed        quot you should thank god you even have air conditioning in these rooms some people cant afford air conditioning quot I was so humiliated I turned and just walked away in disgust My advice    Be afraid be very afraid  
N => At least theres no bugs Yeah its not the Hyatt but its cheap convenient and there always seems to be rooms here  
N => essenziale ma in posizione eccezionale  
N => Great for young  We spent  nights at the Omni to celebrate my mothers birthday  We were traveling with our  year old amp chose the Omni for its family friendly reputation  We were very pleased  We got a great rate through the hotels own website  less than night for a primo Gold Coast location  Heres a point by point Cleanliness  no problem here  The rooms were neat clean amp stocked with abundant linens amp delightful bath salts nice if youre a bath salt type Location Fantastic About  mile to Millenium Park  We had beautiful weather amp walked a lot Rooms The rooms are all suites which is great if you have a toddler in a crib  Would have given a th star but from our corner room on the th floor we could hear the service elevator all night  We didnt notify the staff so I really have no right to complain but next time Ill request a room away from the elevators Service The Omnis real strength is the staff  Everyone we interacted with was warm friendly professional amp dedicated  The concierge Amiri proved to be an invaluable resource for us Chicago newbies  The restaurant staff were professional and very knowledgeable about their products  Everyone doted on our two year old son amp the Omni Kids gift pack plastic toys kept him well entertained  A woman in the lobby greeted my husband with a bottle of water when he returned from a morning run I gave  stars because the staff was excellent but not perfect  Cake and champagne the concierge graciously arranged for my mother was sent to our room instead oops  The front desk had me sign a form for a quotfit kitquot that was apparently delivered to my room amp for which I would be charged  if I didnt return it  It turned out that it was never delivered  This situation was immediately and easily resolved with  phone call Value We felt we got a great deal  My mother amp her husband were very happy amp comfortable in their room  We loved having the restaurant with its variety of excellent well prepared fare right downstairs  We joined the quotselect guestquot program amp had complimentary quotgoodquot coffee delivered to our rooms in the morning The Wolfgang Puck coffee pods provided in the room are swill  The quotselect guestquot is well worth joining free if you want to use Wi Fi  day if you arent a member free if you are or have good beverages to wake up to The Omni was a great quothome basequot for our museum trips  We arent really shoppers but if we were the Omni would be located in paradise  Happily recommend it for family getaways  
N => Friends Retreat Hotel was beautiful  We had  queen beds amp Sofa bed Suite It was expensivebut location location Great views from roomEveryone was super polite amp helpful Breakfast was expensiveso we ate our meals other places  We also had to pay   for vallet parking overnight amp the tips  But sharing the expenses it wasnt too bad  Tray of snacks in room was also to expensive candy bargumwater etcSo we passed on those But loved our room 
N => Nice place front desk unresponsive   why go back We stayed at the Omni with  teenagers in t  I very clearly requested adjoining rooms and the front desk confirmed this at check in  The rooms were not connected however and when I pointed out that the word adjoining means connected the front desk manager told me that in this hotel that is not what the word means so I had no reason to expect it to be so  She then assured me that the rooms were next to each other adjacent but not connected adjoining as she acknowledged we had requested  On arrival to our assigned floor we were disappointed to find that the rooms were not connected and not next to each other they were on opposite sides of the hall  When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff the reply was essentially quottoo bad quot There was no attempt to make it right or otherwise satisfy us  This is quite a contrast to other hotels of similar grade where when a mistake was discovered I received a quick apology instead of a foolish argument and a token offer rather than quottoo badquot  Finally I did receive an email from the Omni inviting my comments after our stay  I sent in the above and promptly received another email thanking me and quotyou will receive a response in  hours quot That was a month ago  Location is good rooms were clean and there are plenty of equivalent hotels with better service within walking distance  We stayed at the Sheraton around the block a couple of years ago and had better service we didnt return because the Omni was closer to a family gathering this time  Well walk the extra block and avoid the Omni in the future  
N => We were a bit disappointed with the hotel The hotels location was not bad we were within walking distance to the Navy Pier stores and restaurants  However we found that the hotel wasnt as upscale we hoped it be  The air conditioning lacked in the hallways and the rugs looked liked they hadnt been shampooed in a while which made waiting for the elevator stuffy amp unpleasant  The bathroom and or was contemporary in style throughout and the room was comfortable the overall stay was okay but I might look into another hotel the next time were in town   
N => Fantastic Stay in Chicago My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel  I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite  When we arrived she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested  and more  Our suite had a partial view of the lake And we were able to check in early The service at this hotel is incredible  Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel very near to Michigan Avenue  Housekeeping was prompt and thorough  We really couldnt have asked for a better hotel  We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there  
N => A Bit Disappointed I picked this hotel solely based on the positive reviews on TA   excellent service extra perks friendly people minimal problems etc  Unfortunately that was not so for my boyfriend amp I  We planned amp prepaid this trip   months ago but it was years in the making  This was the th anniversary of my return to Chicago  I was moved away from my beloved home town at the age of  amp was now returning for the st time in  years to celebrate my nd birthday  When we prepaid   months ago I made sure to call the hotel directly to let them know that I was a Select Guest member I had a voucher for a free room upgrade amp that this was a special occassion  I called  month prior amp  week prior to arrival to confirm everything amp I was assured that everything was set as well as me receiving a room upgrade  The plan was to have a corner room with views amp possibly have a special in room dinner to enjoy the views  On our day of arrival we had  bags amp no one offered to help us  We had to haul everything into the hotel ourselves  We stood in the lobby w all our luggage for awhile waiting to check in only to be told check in was on the rd floor   still no offer to help wour bags  We get to check in amp I gave the woman our room upgrade voucher amp explained that we were Select Guest members amp she said the hotel was sold out amp could not upgrade us but assured us that we had an excellent room  As a Select Guest member I had requested a room away from the elevator on a high floor  We get to our room amp not only are we the closest room to the elevator our room is right next to the ice machine room  The constant sound of people getting ice as early as am amp as late as am was loud amp annoying amp right behind our heads as we tried to sleep  On our nd morning day there I noticed we were still not recieving our morning beverages or newspaper  I called down to the front desk amp a very rude man explained that I should have gotten vouchers for that service at check in amp that there was nothing he could for us that morning  We had to wait until the following morning to receive what I had already prearranged  There were also a few times I called down to the front desk to cancel turn down service get messages etc only to be left on hold for  minutes amp no one ever came back on the line  I guess Ill never know what messages I had  Since I wasnt able to get in touch w anyone to cancel the turndown service I let housekeeping know when they arrived that it wouldnt be necessary for that evening only for them to return  more times amp interrupt our evening  Suffice to stay this hotel was very frustrating  The only positive about the hotel is that we were able to get a late check out which I believe was the least they could do  Fortunately every aspect of our trip was excellent   everything we had preplannedprepaid for went accordingly  Chicago is a fun city amp we will be making this an annual trip  Unfortunately I dont think the Omni will be any part of those  Compared to the other reviews here on TA I feel like we were treated as though we were a nuisance than as guests  There are tons of hotels in this area of Chicago so Im sure it wont be a problem  Plus with that huge construction site that is just starting next door I doubt this will be a peaceful place to come back to relax to  We give our trip  stars but our stay at the Omni  stars  We never did do our special in room dinner since we did not receieve the room we requested  We had high expectations amp were very much looking forward to staying here but this not only left us disappointed but I personally felt very very sad as well  
N => Fell in love as soon as we stepped in to our suite Location is perfect  Spacious  Very clean  Great view from th floor  There was a construction site right next door to the hotel but we never heard it  You really had to strain to look down to see it  Loved having two televisions so I did not have to watch sports highlights all morning with hubby  Free WiFi with select guest was priceless in helping to navigate our daily activities  Each morning we got two complimentary beverages and a newspaper of our choice  The king bed was really comfy  The bathroom was well equipped  Lots of toiletries the extra towels we requested and great water pressure  Chairs were comfortable  Did not use the wet bar or mini bar but if we needed to it was well equipped  There were two sets of elevators to get to our room but we never had to wait more than one minute for an elevator  It felt like extra security  Staff was attentive but not smothering  Only complaint I have is that the temperature was difficult to regulate  In order for the room to stay cool the way we like it we had to leave the fan on  The auto setting did not seem to work or at least I couldnt work it  It is a minor complaint and is way over shadowed by all the wonderful things  Would definately stay here again  
N => Our stay was all that I expected from Omni Chicago   and then some I have been a guest at this Omni in the past and would definitely stay again in the future  I mentioned upon booking and check in that this trip was my gift to my husband for his birthday  The evening of our arrival we received a surprise tray quotfrom the housequot arranged by Jennifer at the front desk containing a bottle of sparkling wine a delicious amp generously sized piece of bittersweet chocolate cake and a birthday card  It was such an unexpected and appreciated gesture that I think it was the highlight of this Chicago weekend All staff was extremely helpful and friendly  Steven was wonderful and offered us a number of suggestions regarding neighborhoods to investigate based on what we described as our interests as well as the best way to get there and eateries en route  He was always right on target  We arrived at the hotel expecting to just check our bags until the room was ready due to the early arrival of our train  Instead we were able to check in immediately and were also granted a late check out although we didnt need it after all upon departure  We were very pleased with every aspect of our rd floor room cleanliness spaciousness comfort noise level free wifi great showertub roomy work area complimentary morning beverages amp paper delivered to the room  It was well equipped and we slept very well on the excellent mattress and pillows  My husband who usually begins his day at  a m  at home was able to sleep in until about  while I luxuriated in a heavenly hot mineral spa bath each morning These are the things that will bring us back The only reason I did not give high ratings on quotaccuracy of billquot was this our printed bill that was settled with automated check out did not match up with the funds that would have been charged to my bank  A charge of   was added after the fact for the minibar which we did not even investigate much less use  Also a charge for both nights was quotpendingquot in my account which alarmed me as we had received a special rate of buy one get one night free  This wasnt explained at the time resulting in my calling the Omni Chicago to straighten it out  The accounting staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the situation to my satisfaction  However even after my call to the Omni and being told that the minibar charge would be removed I see that it was processed today through my bank  All in all it was a FANTASTIC stay   all that we had hoped for and more 
N => Friendly Staff So So Service Sub Par Rooms My family and I have traveled to Chicago a few times and we normally stay at the Peninsula  This time however we ided it might be nice to change things up and see what another hotel in the area had to offer  After reading several positive reviews for the Omni on this site we thought we had picked a winner  We thought wrong  The hotel failed to meet our expectations almost immediately  When we arrived at the hotel there were several employees standing outside  We assumed they would help us unload our luggage as we had a party of six and several bags but they seemed content to just watch us do it ourselves  We had booked two rooms and wound up arriving early so they weren t quite ready yet  The room my brother and I stayed in was spacious but was plagued with problems  A couple minutes after arriving in our room loud hammering and drilling started on the floor above us  We eventually retreated to the room my other family members were staying in down the hall  There were issues of cleanliness in our room as well  The coffee table in the living area was sticky the lampshades were all crooked and there were several long hairs stuck to the mirror in the bathroom  These might seem like minor complaints but these problems illustrate an overall lack of attention to detail  I ran into my next problem when I tried to iron my shirt before heading out for lunch  The iron was broken and I had to call for a new one that didn t arrive until about twenty minutes later  The sliding door in our bathroom was also broken  I alerted one of the employees at the front desk who assured me it would be fixed  When I returned to the room I thought the door was in working order but it broke again when I attempted to close it  I didnt feel like making an issue out of it so I ided to leave it shut and just use the other door  There were some positives worth mentioning regarding our stay  The employees were generally very friendly and we got some good restaurant recommendations from one of them  The hotel had a complimentary car service we were able to use and the driver gave us tips about which tourist activities we should check out  The hotel is also located right off of Michigan Avenue steps away from great shopping and restaurants  I really wanted to like this hotel but in the end our stay was hampered by underwhelming service and numerous room related annoyances  I think I can safely say that we ll be sticking with the Peninsula for all future trips to Chicago  
N => overated and we recieved poor service Im surprised to see all the comments about great service  We received poor service immediately starting with check  in  We booked a corner room on hotels com and were charged  extra for the room than a standard suite but upon arrival we were told there was no way we had booked that room through a third party  We were forced to produce a receipt that said corner room and had to argue for several minutes  Then we were told quotwell sorry we dont have any of those available right now quot After more arguing suddenly one was available but only in a smoking when we had requested non  Walking through the hotel later it became very apparent that there were several non smoking corner rooms available  We were only staying for one night so future bookings shouldnt have been an issue Second after getting up to our room we realized that the bellman had not gotten all of our bags from the taxi or they had not made it to our room  After many many conversations with the security team we were allowed to watch security footage of the bags entering the hotel  The missing bag was not on the cart  All they had to say was as you can see it did not enter the hotel so we have no way of finding and returning your bag  I told them it was their responsibility whether it entered or not because their bellman had told us to go ahead and check in while he made sure our bags arrived safely which they didnt  When we left there was no apology just a comment about trying to get a hold of the taxi company but that we should be working on it from our end as well On top of that the rooms are hideously orated in a very s style  I had called ahead to ask about the or because hotels com showed  different styles online the pics and virtual tour did not match  I was assured it was not the style it ended up being  The horrid coffee table was hard to avoid running into and had very sharp corners that did damage to both mine and my fiances legs  The view was alrightbut not spectacular  What I really find unbelievable in a supposed  star hotel is that there was feces on the side of the toilet Pretty much would never stay there again We originally picked this hotel because of location size and we have enjoyed their restaurant  for lunch in the past  There are many hotels with the same location and price they  be smaller but the or makes them better  We will return for lunchbut staying at the hotel is no longer an option  
N => Nice stay great service excellent location We just returend from an  night stay in Chicago at the Omni  In total we where highly satisfied  From the arrival on everybody was really extremely friendly and helpful something not so typical for an US hotel  Check in was quick and we got a nice suite on the th floor  Since we had our  year old son with us we needed a sleeper sofa or some extra bed but in this particular suite nothing was available  So Megan from the front desk immediately switched our rooms to another nice suite now on the th floor facing to the south west corner of the hotel  This suite had a sleeper sofa and large windows behind our bed  Megan even called  minutes after the switch to ensure the new room meets our expectations  Rooms at the Omni are nice and comfy a little bit outdated but in good shape  You will notice that they constantly reate  Space is ample and even with  large suitcases and stuff for  nights we had no space or closet problems  Noise was no big problem for us even with our room facing the construction site on the southern side of the hotel  We usally could sleep until  AM without any trouble  Since I am a Select Guest member we enjoyed the complimentary morning beverage service  After the th night I was automatically upgraded to the platinum level and they brought us the nightly complimentary water and sweets  Everybody in the hotel was extremely friendly  A big plus is the location on Michigan Avenue  You are right in the middle of everything  We enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet every morning with a great selection of fresh fruits and berries  This was outstanding and superior to all other US hotel breakfast buffets we had over the last couple of years  Right in the middle of our stay I lost my wallet with credit cards ID driver license and money in a cab that was taking us to the Omni  Believe it or not the person taking the cab as a passenger after we have left found my wallet and immediately e maied to me  He even delivered my wallet back to the hotel and lined the offered reward  Thanks again to this honest finder In total we enjoyed our stay at the Omni and in Chicago very much  The city is great fun even for younger children  We where really sad that we had to leave but hope to come back soon 
N => A wonderful hotel with superb service We have just rteturned from a three day getaway in Chicago  We chose the Omni Chicago for its location but will definitely return as a result of the wonderful service we received while staying there We were able to arrange an early check in and a later check out without any difficulty  A call to housekeeping requesting more pillows was answered and acted on immediately I inadvertenly left an item in our room and discovered this when we returned home  A phone call was all it took to have the item returned to me in less than two days I would highly recommend this hotel for all age groups  The exceptionally clean suite attentive service and very polite employees all contributed to a very memorable time  Thank you to all at the Omni Chicago  
N => Fantastic hotel What a great hotel My husband and I came back the other day from a  night stay at the Omni and had a fantastic time  From the time we checked in until we left the whole staff was incredibly friendly and helpful  We arrived early amp were allowed to check right into our room  The room itself was very spacious and clean and the location was perfect  A big shout out to the concierge cus who got us a reservation at an amazing restaurant and also gave us directions to the Museum of Science amp Industry which was great as well as Cellular Field for a ball game  Our trip was wonderful from start to finish  Dont forget to sign up for the guest rewards program which gives you some nice perks  I would absolutely stay here again on my next trip to Chicago  
N => Loved the Omni We stayed at the Omni just for one night for going to festivals around Chicago  We dont live very far from Chicago so we took an early train in and arrived at the hotel around  AM  We were planning on just having our luggage stored so we could right away head out but the front desk rep asked if we were willing to wait just   minutes we might be able to check in right away We ided to wait and it was really worth it  We were given a th story king suite with a nice view  He even apologized that a room wasnt ready immediately    we never expected to have a room that early so already we our expectations were metRoom was very nice with a bedroom arate from the living area wet bar and nice bathroom amenities  There was a coffee maker too but we are Omni Select members and they give you a request to complete for the morning and will bring coffee and juice to your room with a newspaper  We headed out and about and returned tired and ready to rest at the end of the day  So ided to order room service pretty late     PM  The operator said it would take roughly  minutes for the food we werent really happy but thought    we are late so we will wait  Roughly  minutes later we had our food  It was good too  Burgers but with fresh made salads that they specially made since we didnt want the options given on the menu  I like that the food is served on a rolling table too so you dont have to sit eating off a coffee table We had turn down service with Evian water delivered just prior to our room service Bed was really comfortable and I had requested extra foam pillows and they were waiting at our arrival  The next day we had breakfast in the  Restaurant  We just ided on the buffet and it was very good  Fresh fruits that actually not only looked good but tasted good    strawberries melon pineapple etc  Waffles fresh made omelets cereals bagels etc  Price wasnt bad for Chicago either and I loved their giant coffee cups since we are big coffee drinkers Check out was easy   just dial a number and you are ready We would most definitely stay at the Omni again  Service was great hotel has a very nice design  Fitness center was small but had options of equipment  I liked that they have a sun k with a very nice view of the city  There is construction going on right next door but we never heard a thing in the hotel  Location is very good since it is right on Michigan Avenue in the middle of everything  
N => Friendly  My fiance and i booked through hotwire so we didnt know where we would stay untill we paid for it and only paid a discounted amout normal rooms run around  we paid  or so i wouldnt pay  to stay in the room we got i would for a larger one as it was smaller than the website but it served its purpoise as we only stayed one night anyways  also the doors slam loud that was my only other complaint They also let you bring dogs too which is nice and unusuall we were watching my brother in laws dog small lbs and mightve had to bring her and they were more than willing to work with us on that  We went in just for the weekend and from the second i got there i was amazed at the staff  They were so friendly and it didnt feel fake or forced like they just wanted a tip and most times i find people are not as nice to us we are young amp and i feel like they dont think you will tip well so they dont pay attention to you or arent as friendly and i was really worried about this at the omni because its a very nice place but they were SO friendly and helpful showed us to the evelvator took our car and informed us of the  dollar parking fee for hrs valet took our bags for us the front desk was great too she was friendly when we got up there we called doen to the concierege to ask for the number to Texas De Brazil which was also AMAZING and very friendly in its own right would reccomend to anyone amp everyone he just went ahead a got us a reservation and made sure it was the time we wanted and everything  The location is to die for too as we went to shop on michigan ave  the next morning we got up and took our bags to be checked it was no problem called for the car like  min before we were leaving when we arrived the valet said it would be  dollars for hrs and it takes  mins for the car to come around so we were warned and it was there waiting before we got back they loaded our bags and one of them even took our gross mc donalds bag from the drive up and threw it away  Overall amazing mini vacation the friendly ness of the staff was enough to make me come back they were incredible and really made my trip I would more than reccomend this hotel to others  
N => Wonderful Hotel Great staff and service  From the moment my wife and I arrived on the  ch we where made very welcome  The staff were GREAT and very happy to try to meet out needs  Managed to extend our room to   on the day we departed with no issues  Our room was very clean and as described in the booking  Kept very clean and turned down each evening  The gym was great although a bit small but fill all needs  Would stay there again and recommend to all to try  Lastly GREAT LOCATION  
N => Great location wonderful staff pricey but worth it Every staff person we encountered was incredibly polite professional knowledgeable and courteous  Valet service remembered our name and volunteered to clean up the coffee cups etc in car after very long trip to Chicago  Concierge had great restaurant recommendations and directions  Walking distance to Hard Rock ESPN Giardanos etc  Check in and check out took less than  minutes each  Pool area was clean but full of used towels on chairs  Fitness room was spotless  Had  doubles with sofa sleeper suite  Room was very clean and perfect for family of five  Two tvs and phones  View was fine  Shower amenities robe make up mirror were nice  Bathroom was accessible from living room and bedroom  Room had coffee maker but no fridge  We didnt get key to mini bar so cant comment on that  Thermostat controlled temperature very efficiently  Room service for breakfast was ordered the night before and delivered exactly at time requested   Restaurant was contemporary  Halls were quiet  Housekeeping was great  Cookies and milk delivered to room was pleasing to the kids  Entrance to hotel is not on Michigan Street but it is easy to find  Location is near Apple and Disney Stores  Elevators were quick  Sign up for free Select Guest program  It provides complimentary beverages in the morning newspaper etc  We ended up needing a late check out and that was easily accommodated  Perfect stay 
N => Mini Moon We booked this hotel through hotwire last minute right before our wedding  We were taking our traditional honeymoon to Mexico in ember but still wanted to get away for a few days  This hotel was amazing  The room was spectacular with great views of the city  Very clean room bathroom and the housekeeping staff did a nice job with our room as well  Upon check in we told them it was our mini moon and they had champagne and strawberries delivered to the room that evening free of charge  We spoke with the concierge to book some stuff to do and she got us tickets to see the season premier  Olympics homecoming taping of the Oprah show  The rest of the staff we encountered were all very friendly as well The location is great right in the middle of everything you could want to do in the Mag Mile area of Chicago  We had breakfast room service delivered the first morning which was excellent  The pool exercise room and hot tub were very nice but we only took advantage of the hot tub  They have fresh ice water with lemon in the gym available for all  They also have fresh lemonade in the lobby in the afternoons which was excellent The only negative if you could call it that was the bathroom  It was kind of small but we didnt really spend much time in there If you book here you should join the Omni rewards club prior to checking in to get some additional perks  
N => Far from what youd expect from reviews  The wife and our  month old dhter stayed here for some after Christmas New Years Eve  jubilationshopping  From the get go this was botched  Everything i was told i was getting with my quotpackagequot was changed  times finally being told quotyou have no package with your room purchasequot  This was quotrectifiedquot by giving me what I was supposed to receive with the quotoriginal packagequot i was told i was getting  We stayed on the th floor and my room smelled as smoky as a bar  I called the front desk  times to inquire and i was told that it was coming from the th floor which was their smoking floor and since it was New Years Eve although it was the same for  nights prior they really couldnt do anything about it  Be warned  The food in  was very good and the staff were all very nice  It was far from what the reviews on the forum would have led me to expect  
N => Holiday Weekend wfamily I could not be more impressed with this hotel  The reviewer before me said everything I would have said  I will add that they are great with kids  By far the most accomodating for children that I have ever seen  When we entered the hotel the bellman completely stopped what he was doing to walk behind the counter to give a quotgoodie bagquot to our  year old that had a lot of stuff in it  Included in the bag is a reusable plastic cup that they use to get free drinks any time  They also have a bag that can be checked out through the concierge that includes kids games puzzles etc  They are obviously popular as we werent able to obtain one  Request one ahead of time if you can  All staff were very accomodating  Their training department has done well  
N => Perfect Hotel  Great Anniversary Weekend over Halloween  Checked in early around noon to our executive suite on th floor  We had   offand free upgrade via ebay but i checked in online few days prior so at checkin they asked my nameand handed me the keys no hassle thanks to melissa concierge she arranged for my rose petals i ordered to be in room scatteredalong with their complimentry bottle of wineand chocolate cake and fruit platterwith greetings  I loved refreshing music playing in both rooms via lcd plasma screen very romanticpeaceful and clean suiteand quiet  Room service was great although at    for  breakfast steaksand a waffle it should have beenand was thanks to i believe her name was nina   room service  As a select guest i received comp beverage each morning at the time i requested truly enjoyed my stay  This hotel is across streeet from Mac storeexpressand talbots to help you pinpoint it on mag mile  Also if in no rush catch train from ohare to downtowncost     minute ride easy Lucked out weather was  degrees that weekend Thanks Omni 
N => Perfect in every way Chose the hotel for its location a safe area and close to the subway  We were not disappointed from the moment we booked staff enrolled us on the membership scheme meaning we could choose types of pillow etc Room was superb very good value for money and had a great sleep  Only disappointment was due to a prior engagement I had to miss breakfast  
N => Expensive Parking noisy elevators otherwise great suites We stayed three nights in an executive suite on the rd floor  The room itself was outstanding  Large corner room with great views a large living space and completely arate bedroom  Bed linens etc  were all nice and the room was very clean  Two large flat screen TVs one in the bedroom the other in the living room Location on Michigan Ave is very nice  Easy to walk to shops and lots and lots of cabs  Theres also a free downtown shuttle that you can pick up just down Michigan Ave that takes you to Navy Pier and elsewhere  Its a nice walk down to Millennium Park Why not five stars Two reasons First our room was apparently near the quotservice elevatorquot  All night long we heard the relatively loud to my ears mechanical whirring of the elevator up and down all night long  This kept me up for hours the first night and I am not normally bothered by such things  I asked for a room switch in the morning but they only had downgraded rooms  A woman named Cassandra was very pleasant and tried her best to be helpful under the circumstances  She even delivered earplugs to my room which I used to block out the noise Second the hotel charges   night to park your car  This is exorbitant for even downtown Chicago  Worse the charge is not advertised or posted or signed anywhere and no one tells you when you hand over your keys  You only find out when you get your final bill  I can understand up to  but  is very hard to swallow  I complained to the front desk upon check out but they just said quotsorryquot   for three nights  Later I wrote an email to Omni and got a personal email reply saying that the parking charge was a quotshock to many guestsquot but that the front door staff is expected to quotexplain the pricing and to offer alternativesquot  Since this was not done in my case they agreed to give me a partial refund which I was happy with As I said the hotel was otherwise very nice and I would stay there again without my car if I could get a room away from the elevator  
N => Loved the Omni As a first time visitor to Chicago I could not have had a better experience  There was a friendly greeting andor helpful information every time we encountered any staff  Our room was beautiful with amazing views of the lake and the city  Room service was quick andthe food delicious  So much of what we wanted to see and dowas literally a short walk from the front door  At the end of a day of walking in the city we looked forward to a peaceful and luxurious nights sleep in a wonderful bed  We hope to return to Chicagoand stay again at the Omni  
N => Loved the Omni  Proposed to my wife at this hotel  This is a great hotel to stay at while visiting Chicago  Right on the Mag Mile and in walking distancing of anything you could possibly want to do  Our first night we had dinner at Lawrys Prime Rib and it was wonderful and just a five minute walk from the hotel  I would recommend if you are on a budget theres a mall right next door to the hotel that has a food court  Its a cheaper alternative to eating in the hotel restaurant or room service  Although the room service we ordered was pretty good  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good place to stay in Chicago  Although it can be pricey  
N => Great location outstanding service I just came back from a two days business trip to Chicago and Stay at Omni was a quite good experience  My room was a little bit smaller than the american average but it was still large enough for me  The location is perfect just in the Michigan Ave the service was perfect also they take care of everything in a fast and helpfull way  The breakfast in a european style was a good surprise they also have an american breakfast with all that fat things if you prefer   The only thing I have to complain is the shower that was over the bathtub and the drain was not fast enough then I had my feet soaked every time I had a shower Besides of that I definitely recomend this hotel  
N => Great location but not a great room Was a little let down by this hotel I LOVED the location  Right in the heart of N  Michigan Ave  and all its shopping But the room itself was pricey for the size of the room  Stayed in the suite and it was tiny Furniture in the room was ancient and looked shabby too  Didnt want my guest to come up as I was a little embarrassed  
N => Perfect We went to Chicago for a quick getaway I picked this hotel because it we right in the center of the Magnificient Mile  Only problem was finding the hotel sorta you actually have to turn onto E  Huron St  that is where the enterance to the hotel is  This hotel is exactly where you would want to stay it you dont want to mess around with driving around looking for places  Perfect location When we figured that out it was wonderful from then on the bell man was great very nice and friendly we used Valet parking which was a little high but standard  Check in was quick and easy  Our room was great You have amenities better than standard two robes electronic safe umbrella bath salts mouthwash bubble bath and standard shampoos and lotions  The towels were huge the blow dryer was just like mine at home not those tiny little one attached to the wall  Great view We also visited the hotel lounge very nice quick and good service  One thing if you are going to visit this city be prepared to spend alot of money if you are going be drinking buy before you come I had a Grey Goose and Oj my husband had a bottle of Bud Light and this cost   whew I was a little shocked  It was this way just about everywhere we stopped  I would also recommend going to Giodarnos it is close to the hotel and the stuffed pizza it Excellent Definetely would stay at this hotel again 
N => Nice if you get it for Cheap but not worth  We stayed at the Omni on a Saturday  The hotel was crowded because Chicago was hosting the national dental convention  Our check in was quick and the room was clean and nice  All of their rooms are suites so they were very spacious  When you enter the hotel you have to go up one elevator to get to the lobby then take a different elevator to get to your room  They cant really change that but it was a bit annoying In the morning we called the front desk to get a train schedule  They told me to come down and look on line at the business center  I didnt feel like doing that so the clerk said she would call me back shortly  About  hour passed and she still hadnt called back we were afraid wed miss our train  I went downstairs and there were  staff members chatting and ignoring me  When I asked the clerk about the schedule she said quotOh Yeaquot and printed it out for me  Not even an apology for never calling back We did not pay full price for the hotel we got it for  on priceline  The normal price is  but I do not think its worth it  The staff should be much more attentive and the hotel should be nicer for  per night  
N => Terrible    I could not believe this was an Omni hotel     When we arrived everything seemed to be great   we were able to check in early etc Once we were unpacking we went to put our clothes in the dresser we were planning on staying a few days  The drawers were loaded with dust  Not just a normal dusting but an actual layer  We opened all drawers and they were like this  We looked at appliances like the coffee machine they had dust on the top  We called the front desk because the drawer dust ruined the first pair of pants I tried to put in we had to ask for these to be dry cleaned and insisted it be done that day  When we returned from a few hours of shopping we were greeted by room service with a bottle of wine a box of chocolates and a note of an apology of how they presented the room to us  We thought this was nice the box had  pieces as we got to the th piece we realized the piece was infested with worms     it was hard to see them as this piece of chocolate had crumbled nuts and be oats so this seemed edible until I saw it move  We took these down and they apologized but not like we would think hotel that is managed well  They blamed this on their manafacture stating the manafacture would be reimbursing us one nights room expense  They never really apologized that this box of chocolate went through their room service and wasnt first inspected  All apologies were that the manfacture supplied these  We did not pay for any nights there and would have switched if there would have been rooms available elsewhere but we were there during the holidays  I will never stay at any Omni because of this experience and because after we were sent worms we had to approach the staff there  We were very shocked and disappointed  If you ide to stay there look before you consume anything there  
N => little less than before I actually got a great deal on hotwire on this hotel so it was not overpriced for me but if I had paid a few hundred bucks I would be livid The omni has lost a little bit of his sparkle the staff was pleasant needs to update interior beds are soft avoid front of hotels rooms to much noise around weekends not as stellar as years past but good location to shop  
N => Business Travelers should avoid this hotel  The first evening I was there I spent well over an hour and a half on three arate calls to technical support for their wireless system  They were never able to connect me and I spent the entire visit  days and  nights without access to e mail or the internet  This was a business trip and no access was a real problem  Then when I got back I discovered the many changes technical support had made to my laptop settings interferred with my ability to access wireless in other settings  It has taken  days to straighten that out  What a nighte  
N => A Few Rough Spots but Generally an Excellent Hotel First of all although they confirmed adjoining suites when we checked in they didnt adjoin  The desk clerk couldnt seem to understand what we were saying  But eventually she straightened it out  And the concierge sent us to an excellent restaurant    but he gave us the wrong directions causing us to get lost for a half hour or so  But these were the only problems  The Omni is excellent in all respects  We had nice suites on the st floor looking north on the Mag Mile  Outside of the two minor glitches above its a great place to stay and Id do it again  
N => be NOT so great    After reading the reviews I am wondering if my standards are just too high  We booked up to a west view suite for our stay  I expected a spacious room with spectacular views  We got a room wa king bed a desk and  chairs  Somehow that does not equate to a suite even judging by the diagram given by the hotel website  We were on the nd floor which should be a good view no matter what side of the hotel you are on but our view was into the adjacent condos   shades of quotRear WindowThe ac worked but minimally leaving the room very warm at  or  in the afternoon and the ac ran all night  A plus was that the windows did open albeit only  inches but that helped rid the room of the heat  The room was clean tidy and well supplied  Housekeeping was great  Overall just a C on the stay  
N => Nice but expensive We stayed at the Omni earlier this month and it was a nice stay  The suites are smaller but still roomy  The price was over  a night but we were able to get he room half price because of the Entertainment book with coupons  So for the price we paid I think it was worth it  The location was great  We walked everywhere  The  for valet parking is a bit ridiculous but what else can you do The rooms were kept clean and the staff was OK   not extremely friendly but nice enough  The indoor pool is smaller than it appears on the website  FYI   if you sign up to be a quotselect guestquot on the Omni website and give them your assigned number when you check in you get free beverages and newspaper brought to you every morning and turn down service each night  This added a nice touch to our stay  
N => Second visit  keeps getting better After a stay a few months back we returned to the Omni with our five year old son in tow for a family visit  We used a Select Guest upgrade voucher and were able to get the Executive Suite  Nice to have the dining table and a little extra elbow room note  the bathroom in this suite is actually considerably smaller than the one in the corner suite but still fine  Once again the staff and ameneties made this a very enjoyable stay    Kid extras  Cookies and milk on our first night was a great bonus  This  also have been available on other nights but we werent around on other evenings  Also a super bag of books games and activities  Wasnt available when we checked in limited number first come first served but a tremendously helpful front desk manager   who also was helpful in a past visit   made it magically appear when we asked him about it  The pool while small is a great bonus when traveling with a child   Select Guest extras  Definitely sign up for this program  Local paper coffee fresh OJ small smoothie  all delivered to your door each morning  Heavenly   Small requests not a problem  Early check in airport car service arrangements through the concierge   Room service and housekeeping  Very good food delivered quickly the housekeeping staff did lovely little extras like tuck my sons stuffed animals in his bed so they were waiting for him when we got back to our room in the evening  Sweet  
N => Omni    Luxury and Value on the Magnificent Mile I live in Texas but love visiting Chicago to shop eat and relax  On this particular trip I was joined by my husband and  year old dhter  We ided to travel in style and opted for a pricey hotel on North Michigan Avenue  After two nights in the tiny overpriced room we moved a few blocks over to The Omni   a hotel where I ve stayed in the past and where Oprah keeps her guests  There s a reason why Our room was a deluxe suite which generally runs for around  which was considerably less than the tiny room we checked out of  Our suite at the Omni which was tastefully appointed with the usual Omni granite and upscale d cor had a living room two TVs pull out sofa and King bed  The bathroom which included a tub and very good shower was gigantic  The walls must have been pretty thick because we were staying next door to a group of guys and didn t hear any anything The room did have a coffee pot but if you sign up to be an Omni member free they will bring you fresh coffee a paper and your choice of juice in the morning  There was also a mini bar but we didn t use it The pool is small but we were happy to have one for our dhter to splash around in  There s also a bright healthfitness center with plenty of treadmills and other equipment The staff members were extremely courteous the concierge was able to help me choose restaurants and seemed to enjoy doing so and the lobby s being on the third floor gave a feeling of extra security which we didn t have at the other hotel  I would highly recommend this hotel to any group of  or more visiting Chicago  
N => Magnificent location Solid  star hotel well located on the Magnificent Mile shopping precinct  Spacious room with flat screen TV and wireless broadband internet  Strangely no electronic safe   only a weird manual safe which you had to contact reception to use  Bed had a quotpillowtopquot mattress which I personally dont like but was otherwise fine  Buffet breakfast quite good with made to order omelettes available  No muesli unlike in Europe  Staff friendly and efficient  
N => Costly but worth it Stayed at the Omni    traveling with another couple  We arrived VERY early  AM and understandably our rooms werent available  They held our bags sent us to a great breakfast place Tempo called our cell when the rooms were ready  AM We mentioned it was our th anniversaries reason for our trip  When we returned that night we had beautiful desserts and cards in our rooms  Rooms are nice but nothing special flat screen TVs in the sitting area good counterspace in the bathroom comfortable beds  Its pretty quiet   be because of the suite set up  In some hotels you hear doors slamming at all hours but I never noticed it at the Omni  Good location  a  minute walk to active part of Rush Street  minutes to trains right on the Magnificent Mile  Cab rides to other spots like Navy Pier which we walked in  minutes were about    Were used to NYC so it seemed like a bargain  Like most big cities the taxes on the hotel rate will surprise you so keep it in mind when you plan   its a killer 
N => Splendid My wife and I flew into Chicago this weekend to see the play quotThe Color Purplequot and chose to stay at the Omni while in town  We come to Chicago  or  times a year but this was our first stay at the Omni  I will tell you that our stay was wonderful from the phone call to the hotel to let them know that we were checking in late that evening to the concierge calling our airline to make sure that we could take something onboard our flight home The room was very nice and clean we enjoyed having two televisions instead of one especially the plasma in the sitting room area  It would have been nice to have the plasma in the bedroom  The staff was great and very attentive to our needs and we also put out the do not disturb sign on our door  And the front desk called that evening wanting to know if we wanted our room cleaned that evening so I guess that problem has been solved But overall we had a great stay and plan on coming back this fall for a  or  day stay  The only two complaints that I have concern the fact that you have to use two different elevators and on site parking is   dollars a night  So prepare to spend a little more if you want the Omni to park your car 
N => Nice but not fabulous We have visited Chicago often but have never stayed at the Omni  We were looking for a hotel that could provide a  bedroom suite and the Omni was able to do that for a reasonable price  We had a king suite that adjoined to a double room which then in essence is the two bedroom suite I do feel that its above average but was not blown away by anything We had our  teenage kids and our niece that is in her mid s with us so this set up was ideal  In this same situation we would stay here again  Check in was definitely weird because you come in to a lobby w a desk and naturally a line formed  A bunch of us stood there waiting for a clerk to become free  When she finally finished w the person she was helping she quottuned intoquot the line and said quotoh check in is up stairsquot  Then once you get up to that level you have to take a different elevator to get up to the rooms  Not a big deal really but just kind of inconvenient if youre hauling bags The rooms were clean and nice  Bathrooms felt a bit dated  Very well stocked mini bar  Room service seemed to take a long time  Restaurant was good for breakfast Cannot beat the location if youre shopping on quotThe Miracle Milequot Would definitely stay here again with our family but not when were in town as a couple 
N => Ok but not fantastic Had a good price so couldnt really complain but the hotel was overun with screaming kids  We called reception one night at  pm as the corridor was full of kids yelling and banging doors  Security came and the mother just said quotso whatquotWe asked for a slightly late check out but were refused as the hotel was full we only wanted an hour and they didnt even check our room on the systemNighte leaving   we eventually reclaimed all our baggage from the store  bags including skis and boots then had to move it ourselves   wed just about finished loading it into the airport express van with the drivers help when a quotsuitquot asked me how much longer wed be still not offering to help  Only worth it if you get a very good price location excellent  
N => Standard Issue Business Suite Hotel Stayed here for two nights on a business trip  While not bad by any means the ent sized suite is fairly characterless and in fact a little cold style not temperature Thought the food at  on the fourth floor was terrific  I had a late night snack with a salad flat bread pizza was fantastic with a great glass of wine Our big complaint was valet parking  They require  minutes notice to bring your car around and then did not deliver in that time frame several times   didnt even have record of our request once All in all dont think you can go wrong in this great downtown location but you could certainly find more interesting places to stay if that matters to you  Given how much I travel for business I like to be pampered a little more and be in more interesting surroundings  
N => Not What We Expected I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasnt sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high  We stayed here for  nights  The room was fine when I walked in  But about five minutes or so I was all congested  Thought it might have been from the flight I then noticed there was dust everywhere  The TV the Minibar and worst of all the air vent  It was literally hanging off the vent  I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up  After  minutes of waiting and noticing other things  A bathroom door that wouldnt close broken light fixtures a toe or fingernail on the bed  broken bathroom fixtures  This place was a dump  Hopefully the pictures will show some of it  I could go on and on Almost  minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room Both he and head of housekeeping were quotshockedquot at the room  We were moved to another room not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked or so I was told I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed  But this will be the last time  Sad to say The hotel did cut the rate of our  day stay but doesnt explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection  
N => Very Pleasantly Surprised We wanted a place on the middle to Northern part of Michigan Avenue and stay at a very nice place  I labored over which hotel to select  Initially I thought the Park Hyatt would be the best place for the money in meeting my expectations however it was going to cost nearly twice as much  I finally ided to take a chance and selected the Omni but was afraid it might end up being a disappointment  Not the case Our room was on the rd floor  The suite was not huge but very suitable for the two of us  The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating in all respects  This hotel represents an excellent value given its location and I would recommend it  
N => Great location greatly overpriced Make sure you ask to stay on a really high floor or your view will be of an enormous air conditioning unit as ours was floor   I called for a rollaway bed to be delivered while we were out for the evening but when we returned pm no bed  To the staffs credit when I called to again request it they responded within  minutes  Not sure why this hotel is outrageously expensive  other than the fabulous location  Have certainly experienced better appointed rooms softer blankets and nicer bathroom lotions at other way less pricey hotels like nearby Hotel Allegro  All in all we did have a good stay but simply because of the friendly staff and location  Was NOT impressed with the breakfast  Id bet my life that the french toast I ordered had been made hours earlier and kept on a warming tray  Definitely eat elsewhere  
N => sleepless in Chicago Stayed at the Omni for a weekend shopping trip and have been to a number of other hotels on the Magnificent Mile  Room was a suite with pull out couch in parlor  extremely uncomfortable for my  yr old  Room was tinycramped and king bed uncomfortable  Bathroom was large but dated with odd layout and not enough hookstowel racks  Most interesting problem was that the room on the th floor quotsqueakedquot all night due to the wind rocking the building structure Although the movement of the building was not discernable this squeaking noise made it impossible to sleep  Location was good but this hotel is nothing special and the structural idiosyncracy makes it not worth the  per night  
N => Arrived happy  left in tears   Arrived excited my first trip to chicago  Everyone impressed me so much great attention to detail and friendliness  One of the doorman even helped me with my personal video  Arrived on a Friday  il st    But on the day I was to check out while packing  I received a phone call that my mother had passed away  My heart was broken but each and every staff person  after hearing my plight was as if I had known them for years offers of tissues and hugs were all around  thank you all for your compassion  I will be back  
N => Inconsistent Service My family stayed at the Omni hotel after hearing several positive reviews from other people who have stayed there  Despite reations the hotel is still in need of updating  We were placed in connecting rooms on the th floor  The toilet in one of the bathrooms flooded the floor every time we flushed  The service response was immediate but the fix did not work and we had to call again  The Michigan Avenue traffic was extremely loud and nobody in my family slept the first night  They did move us to the nd floor which was much quieter  The doors are in need of replacement and do not have silencers which keep them from slamming  The doors were scratched and the hallway walls were damaged in many places  You have to take two elevators to get to the ground level which some might find inconvenient  In response to our first night they did provide us with a  breakfast voucher  We were supposed to have received care packages for each child but they did not supply those when we checked in  We had to call down to the desk and have them sent up  The second day after being away all day we came back to rooms that had not been cleaned  We had to call around  and have the maid come up and clean  This was incredibly inconvenient given we were traveling with three children and wanted the late afternoon to relax before we went to dinner  The air conditioning was freezing and unless you had it set on a low temperature the humidity never escaped from the bathrooms which have no exhaust systems  The sliding doors to both bathrooms were broken the mirror in one bathroom was rusted and the coffee maker was broken  The maids did not always replace the coffee  There was mold present in many places including the bathtub and around the windows  There was rust around the pool  The picture of the pool online was nice but its actually representative of a high school gym from the s  It was aluminum The pool water was too hot we heard several guests complaining and the jacuzzi water was either scorching hot or freezing cold  The Concierge was never available when we called although if we left a message they did return the call  The one time they did answer they were not helpful  The service and experience was inconsistent all around  The only positive thing we remember was the Bell Captain  He was exceptional and great with our kids  However we will not stay there again  
N => Excellent Hotel This Omni is a great hotel  Good food including  hour room service excellent rooms great service in proximity to restaurants and night life  We stayed in a king corner suit with a city view on two sides including a wall to wall window over the bed  We were able to walk to several restaurants or take a quick cab  Serious shoping with in walking distance  I think it would be rare to have a bad expierence here  Is it expensive   it can be  However any ent hotel in Chicago is pricy  Definitely recommended  
N => Great location We received a great rate to stay here with a complimentary bkft  This is a location that will allow you to walk in either direction on Michigan Ave  to enjoy shopping in multiple areas  The corner room was spacious and enjoyable to view the lights at nite  We would definitely stay here again  
N => Need to reate Just stayed        With  month advance reservation and arriving at noon checked in to let them know we were there amp stored luggage  When went back at  pm  which was check in  was told couldnt get the corner suite w sofabed as I requested   because someone in the room had late  pm check out  They gave us a room with promise of a roll away   that never came  The room had no drawers anywhere  At  pm went back down amp I requested a differant room   we got a corner suite w sofabed as requested  But the cushions on the sofabed were so broken down they were lower than the frame  The sink at the mini bar sprayed the mirror when turned on  The door hinge on the mini bar fridge was so loose  door ready to fall off   The carpet was overly worn amp the wallpaper in bathroom coming off  On the maid service they forgot us totally one day  The pillow was lumpy  The robes were rough  I think theyre in real need of some attention to updating amp maintenance  Great location is all I can say  
N => Great Location Excellent Service My wife four children and I ided to take a last minute trip to downtown Chicago  We booked the day we arrived  I was suspicious of the hotel because the rate was better than anything I was quoted by comparable hotels and they had rooms available at the last minute on a weekday which I have found to be rare in this location  We were pleasantly surprised all around The hotel provides a courtesy car for drop offs  The driver Scott was courteous and knowledgeable about the city  The view of Michigan Avenue was a plus  We will stay there again  
N => Had a great time We went there the spring of  and had a Wonderful time  From the minute we got there we were treated wonderfully  The only bad thing is when you have a day of shopping you have to get onto  different elevators just to get up to your room  It was nice with a Child due to the erate bedroom area  She could go to bed earlier and I could stay up later and not feel I was keeping her awake  One other thing that was negative is check the experation dates on things in the inroom snack bar  A few of our things had expired over a year earlier  But besides that it was great     
N => Would recommend Omni  
N => Only place to stay on the miracle Mile  
N => Especially Bad Where do I begin checked in   they had a rate  higher than quoted     told my room was upstairs     directed to nearesr flight  wheel in my lbs of equipment and start hauling it upstairs only to find that i had the very last room  yards away where i could have driven my car to and unloaded from there     get everything in room   time to ice beer   NO MICROFIRIDGES AT  A NITE COMERCIAL RATE      find that ALL the ice machines do not work    have to walk  yards to the restaurant for ice    in the morning the WIFI WAS DOWN      requested a reset curtly told  minutes     an hour and a half later i called about it    quotoh maintenance man just got here ill have him take care of itquot     the WIFILASTED ABOUT  MINUTES until it crashed       cheesed i ided to shower  NO HOT WATER ZERO     packed my stuff and left  my business partner was coming in that day     we were going to be in the hotel for a week to  days     from the reaction of the front desk when i checked out they could care less  THEY DIDNT HAVE THE PRUDENCE TO COMP MY ROOM  AMAZING THAT BEST WESTERN ALLOWS THEM TO USE THEIR NAME  i stay in hotels booking for  rooms for  months straight  illbe avoiding best westerns from here on 
N => The Smelly Hotelly Where do I begin This place needs to be torn down and the earth around it scorched  Do not even think about getting a non smoking room here because they all smell like smoke because the whole hotel smells like smoke or mildew or worse  I was given a room here when the Best Western in DesPlaines overbooked me  quotJust  miles down the roadquot I was told   minutes later and way more than three miles I was checking in to the quotWorst Western Everquot and in no mood to find another hotel  But I still should have made the effort because nothing about this place has any merit  The place is on a busy highway adjacent to a regional airport  No peace shall you find  Please move on  
N => Worst Western There is very little to recommend this hotel save the location  The rooms were tiny and orated with as little aesthetic as possible  They were also just this side of acceptably clean  I always like to look at the shower head if it s dirty you know what kind of attention to detail the rest pf the room is getting  it was dirty  We slept through the complimentary breakfast so I can t comment on it  We expected to stay two nights but checked out after the first night and moved to a property in town I have reviewed it as well under Hampton Inn Chicago  On a positive note the staff was friendly and they replaced the shaving foam that the TSA took from me with a complimentary can  To sum it up a room like this should NOT cost   per night be    
N => Just OK We booked a room at this Best Western because it was inexpensive along with our package deal through Expedia  Based on the reviews on TripAdvisor I thought we would be very pleased  It was JUST OK  Heres my opinionThe hotel is located directly on a major road  You can definitely hear the traffic all hours of the night  It didnt bother us much but if youre a light sleeper you  want to reconsider  The hotel also practically sits directly on the local airport but I dont think planes take off or land there often on the weekends since we didnt hear any of that noise The lobby of the hotel appeared clean  The hallways STUNK like cigarette smoke  The carpet in our room felt damp the entire weekend which grossed me out a little  Otherwise the room was pretty clean  It is located in close proximity to many different small eateries convenience stores etc  If you have  minutes you should drive to a place called quotRise amp Dine quot The food was great for breakfast and lunch because they used all fresh fruits and vegetables    even had a fresh juice bar  Very inexpensive too In all the hotel was ent  We got what we paid for  
N => A happy choice This is a very nice small hotel easy to find near a major north south highway The room was well appointed and very clean with a comfortable king size bed  Free continental breakfast was more than the minimum Would recommend this property and plan to stay there again  
N => Stunning hotel From the minute we walked through the door we were treated like royalty  We never even had to hit the elevator button  Were given a complimentary bottle of champagne for our anniversary and use of the hotel BMW with driver    never paid for a cab The hotel was beautiful view was stunning linens and bed were so comfortable  Every employee was fabulousWeve been here a few times prior have brought our children twice  Complimentary hot cocoa brought to room upon arrival for those visits All four visits to this newer hotel stayed at old Park Hyatt as well were perfect 
N => Great location but expected a bit more We booked this hotel using our American Express card so we got late check out and a breakfast credit for NoMi every morning  However for the price I thought we would have gotten much better service  For example we were never greeted by the staff whenever we entered or left the hotel  Also we had requested a crib for our room before our trip but when we went to check in it was not ready for us  The location is top notch and the room was nice and clean but next time I think Id stay somewhere else  
N => Not my first choice for kids We stayed their over Labor Day  I requested a quotearlyquot check in   hour early as we were going to a show at   Room was not ready at check in and was not very flexible about putting us in another room  After the show we were going to get room service for the kids but the only options on the kids menu was a hot dog and chicken fingers  We opted for another restaurant for the kids  Other negatives wer the siren noise during the night the  valet and wallpaper coming off the wall  Next time we are going back to the Ritz   they are geared more to the families with kids  
N => Fanfastic Hotel We stayed here for  nights on the last leg of our honeymoon and boy what a stay beautiful hotel in the best location   reception staff were fab and on our second night we we very surprised to come back to our room to a bottle of sparkles and strawberries room was fab I couldnt say enough good things about this hotel 
N => Park Hyatt    true luxury Have always wanted to stay at the Park Hyatt but have usually found the rates to be just a bit above my limits so was excited to get a rate in my league  We usually stay at the Drake and have always had a great experience there but the PH is most definitely a step upI assume our room was the least expensive available as there was no view  But the room was awesome  Huge ble tiled bathroom with arate showersoaking tub  Bed beyond comfortable  Quietest room Ive ever been in Service was for the most part great  Everyone addresses you by name very friendly etc  A couple glitches the room is advertised as having a coffeemaker but did not have one  When we ordered breakfast from room service they asked for how many persons the breakfast was for yet only sent up one coffee cup even though we indicated the meal was for two  Quickly remedied in any event Location is perfect cannot ask for better Pool very nice especially if you actually like to swim laps  Hot tub was a few degrees too warm which was disappointing  Showerlocker room facilities were wonderful If I can afford it again will certainly choose the Chicago Park Hyatt 
N => Gorgeous Spotless Hotel If we are in Chicago again we will definitely not hesitate to stay at this hotel  It is unbelievably quiet amp very clean  Each amp every member of the staff we fastidious amp polite  We took advantage of the use of the house town car twice which is not only a savings but more comfortable than taking a taxi  We ate at Nomi for breakfast every day as this was included in our stay  The food was as good as the best breakfasts we have ever had in our travels  Had cocktails out on the patio of the restaurant one afternoon which was very relaxing  I cant express how attentive the wait staff amp hotel staff were during our entire stay  Everyone working the concierge desk was very helpful  The location is perfect amp in walking distance of many attractions  And did I say CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN  which is a big pet peeve of mine  I never got to meet the manager but hats off to him for developing amp training a fine staff 
N => Disappointing start but improved We ided to splash out on the Hyatt based on TA reviews Booked on hotel website in advance and only by chance on checking days before arrival saw the name of our room type had changed amp it was  dollars per night inc tax cheaper  Rang and got it changed easily but reckon others got cheated On unpacking we discovered the stereo didnt work the bathroom door handle was falling off with screws sticking out and the toilet did not flush properly  moved us to another room but had no bath so had to move again Very helpful doorman Joe but  starno Sat in busy bar first night and were pretty much ignored by staff However asst manager did come and find us to apologise for room problems a bottle of wine was sent to our room gratis We had dinner at Nomi food was average cold for some portions waiter was polite but absolutely no finesse could have been working in a caff  And the maitred looked down his nose at usarms folded and spoke totally disinterestedly to us  We had an exquisite meal with great service at Spiaggia italian restaurant One day got back from breakfast to find room cleaning in full swing we were not checking outThe good news we have a sense of humour  The beds are the most amazingly comfortable wed slept in sheets exquisite The bath tub enormous and relaxing  The view onto the water with a window seat fabulous  The location perfect  Breakfast was fantastic good choice great view attentive and pleasant staff leisurely and quiet exceeded our expectations  On check out asst manager knocked a bar bill off to acknowledge our bad start a gesture we appreciated but truthfully would rather have got the service we had so looked forward to Would we stay there again Probably 
N => Loved it Excellent The pizza we ordered through room service was good but we were not used to the Chicago style  We were thankful we were able to get a room here after a long day  
N => Disappointing Wedding Anniversary My husband and I planned a four day trip to Chicago to celebrate our wedding anniversary  After researching a number of properties we chose the Park Hyatt Chicago Upon arrival the front desk staff was very pleasant greeting us by name and offering us a complimentary tea service  Nice touch  But thats where the personal attention ended  After the first day none of the staff seemed to remember our names  The doorman could rarely be found to open the door and the tea service which we planned to make a nightly ritual was not offered again  Two of the four nights we did not receive turn down service and when we requested that the water in our room be replenished it took house staff  minutes to bring up two bottles of water  To my disappointment though it was noted in our reservation itinerary not one staff member could muster a quothappy anniversaryquot  In fact our anniversary was not acknowledged in any way by the hotel  We are well traveled and have received much more personal service from supposedly lesser properties  The location pf the Park Hyatt Chicago is excellent   right on the Magnificent Mile   and the view from our room could not have been better  But if you are looking for personalized service and a special experience you might want to look elsewhere  For us the Park Hyatt did not deliver  
N => Outstanding I used Hyatt points for my weekend stay and as usual this Park Hyatt did not disappoint  Stylish lobby stylish rooms just STYLISH Service as with any PH was flawless  From the spa to room service to check in Ive stayed here twice both time while not living in Chicago I live here now  Once was a Corner Suite and it was massive  The next time I was in a standard room  Both times were amazing and I cannot say enough I wish this review had more detail but in all honesty if youre thinking about it do it  You will not regret it  Its much more stylish theres that word again then The Pen and youll feel very Armani in the place Enjoy  
N => In Answer to the Previous Review YES While I belong to AAA I live by TripAdvisor    but Ive learned that not everyone is going to have the same experience even at the same hotel My familys experience at the Park Hyatt was absolutely great over the week of Independence Day    quite different from the previous reviewers Id been planning this special get away for nearly a year to coincide with the Taste of Chicago and the Pre Independence Day fireworks display sponsored by Macys on y rd  When I requested a room months earlier that would overlook the lake    be to see the fireworks    I was very courteously and promptly told that we wouldnt be able to see the show from the hotel but given an alternate location that would offer a great view which it did  We were still given a great room on a high floor with an incredible view of the water tower and lake When we arrived after a full day of travel    sandy and sweaty from playing at Warren Dunes State Park    in a baseball cap and flipflops we were treated just like the guests in front of us wearing suits and gowns When we needed assistance all we had to do was ask whether it was for extra blankets a phonebook or directions to Lou Malnatis When I was checking our folio on the evening before we were to leave I noticed that wed been charged for raiding the mini bar all it took was a call to the front desk and telling the staff person it wasnt us    parking at day taxed us the mini bar would have just been over the top for my middle class family  The charge was reversed before we checked out the next day Our experience was simply great and Id recommend this hotel to anyone  Any hotel ranked higher must be out of this world and I tend to believe that a bad experience here is the exception rather than the rule  
N => Did we miss something As my wife and I read the other reviews on this property we feltthat we must have missed all the good things said by others about the Park Hyatt  Our  hotel room was small dark and poorly designed Staff was a bit hhty and not very helpful for the most part But the peak was       Our Sunday brunch which was presented nicely but when we got the bill and saw that our mimosas were  apiece for a single small champagne glass of ojchampagne    well that pretty much chinged it   back to the Ritz for us   at least there you pay for what you get and they seem to appreciate their guests  FYI my wife and I are not rookie travelers   all over the world   lived in Chicago most of our lives   Beware      this place for the most part will take your cash and not show you much appreciation for your patronage  
N => Surprised considering past experiences Wonderful room great location but the carpet in the room was very dirty  Also the shades in the bathroom above the very nice soaking tub had burn holes in them perhaps from the candles provided to guests by the hotel  I arrived prior to the check in time and was told by the desk clerk that I would be called when my room became available  No one bothered to call me  The experience was not on par with what one might expect from a hotel of this caliber  I shall try this hotel again just because Ive had better experiences here before  Hopefully this was an anomaly  
N => Stunning service brilliant hotel We have just returned from a  night stay at the Park Hyatt  We had a superb holiday  I always think that the way you are treated at check in is often indicative of how the hotel service will follow through  Here it was faultless  I mentioned to the gentlemen on reception that the holiday was a treat to me from my husband to celebrate our th wedding anniversary  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the th floor overlooking the Water Tower and Lake Michigan  We were escorted to our floor and introduced to our butler Champagne was waiting on our arrival in our room  We travel a lot and stay in good hotels but have never known politeness consideration and kindness like it  We asked the concierge Karen if she could recommend a restaurant  She not only suggested a great one and booked the hotel car to take us she then secretly called the restaurant to tell them about our celebration so that they looked after us when we got there I find it difficult to think of anything else that could have been done to increase the level of service  My only worry now is how are we going to beat this holiday when we next go away 
N => Very disappointing The Peninsula was full so I thought I would try the Hyatt  I stayed there for  days I arrived after a long flight so was looking forward to checking in but guess what   the room was not ready  something which seems to happen more and more in the US  I was asked to come back in an hour came back in two and the room still was not ready  Eventually I got in booked a wake up call and a car the next morning and guess what   no wake up call and no car Things got better but not much so I have difficulty in understanding all the rave reviews  There is no lobby to speak of  so nowhere to wait when the room is not ready and the breakfast in uninspiring  The room is nice with great views and the lunch menu is unusual and the food good However next time I will be staying at the Peninsula  
N =>  Wonderful Stay  Cant wait to go back   Our stay at the Park Hyatt was absoulutely wonderful  The staff was very friendly and were always willing to help out  When we first arrived the check in was very quick  They even asked which newspaper we would like Our room was not ready so they stored our luggage free of charge  When we got back we found that our room was by the elevator  However during our whole stay we never heard the elevator or anyone else come through  We also found bath crystals and soothing crystals in the bathroom  There was even a little tv with hidden speakers under the sink and a erate table with a stool  The bathtub was very spacious but it took about  minutes for the water to fill up half way in the tub  There was a very nice lounging chair with a foot stool  The beds were very soft with very comfortable beds  There was complimentary fresh fruit and bottled water  By far our favorite part was the huge window seat  It was very comfortable with pillows on both sides  We also had an excellent view of the lake and the water tower  The gym was fully equipped with personal tvs and towels set out  There was bottled water available with fresh fruit also  We also found raspberries in one pitcher of water and blueberries in another pitcher of water so it would be flavored  There were also cold towels available too  The pool was velous as there was plenty of seating  There were even toys available for the kids  However the jacuzzi was kind of small  There was even an outside porch like place to sit out and read  We went to Nomi Restaurant for breakfast and there was a wonderful selection of foods  The hotel was in the middle of everything with the American Girl store across the street  The water tower place was kitty corner to it and so was the john handcock building  The magnificent mile was right there so walking along it was very convenient  Ghiradelli was also close by and we enjoyed going there at night to have a dessert  Overall the stay was great with excellent service  
N => A Neat Freaks Dream My stay at the Park Hyatt was flawless  Perfect location in the MIDDLE of everything  Walking distance to everything  Perfectly clean room NO BEDSPREADS only Duvet Covers  The Bathroom was a dream lt  It even had a small television mood music candles bath salts everything you could possibly think of needing in order to have a romantic evening  I am EXTREMELY picky and I was able to walk around the bathroom without shoes  My view from room  was lovely  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  I love this hotel it was extremely private and a dream for a couple  The next time I return to Chicago I will stay here again  Feel free to email me if you have any concerns  
N => Not Worth It After reading the reviews I booked a room here at the Park Hyatt it was not worth the   The rooms were small the staff was very UNFRIENDLY  After spending  I do not expect the staff to act snobby and sneer at questions  The employees just stand around in the lobby do not open doors and act like dance club bouncers instead The carpet had stains this is not what I expected for the amount I paid  Try the Peninsula its way better 
N => Expected more After reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor ided to stay at the Park Hyatt  I think I must have been staying in a different hotel than the rest of you  Room was small and plain with no large screen TV not that I came to watch TV but thats what was advertised  I had to call housekeeping up to clean the door to the toilet closet and I dont like toilet closets  They are okay when I go to Europe I expect that but dont like them personally  The bed was comfortable and lots of pillows  Positive also that they use duvet covers that get changed everyday rather than bedspreads  Absolutely dread bedspreads pull them down off the bed minute I come in the room  They are full of germs  So all in all for the money wasnt that great and wouldnt stay here again  
N => OK Overall this hotel is in a great location but is not worth the high price  We got a ent price using our AAA card including breakfast  They charged us  per person to have the breakfast delivered to our room instead of eating in the restaraunt and the food was so so rather cold  Our room had a nice view bc they gave us an upgraded room on accident but it was a connecting room which we specifically asked on check in to not have  Once they realized they called up and asked if we wanted to move but we were settled at that point  The shelf in our room was falling off the wall but otherwise the room was in good condition  My biggest complaint is that I who have blond hair found a few long black hairs in my brush after housekeeping had been in our room GROSS Weve stayed at the Four Seasons up the street and would recommend them over the Hyatt  We have also stayed at the regular Hyatt across the river after getting a room through a bid site and that was worth the night but not their standard rates  The place was a zoo but the staff was great  They ended up putting us in a Club level room bc there were no other rooms when we checked in and while the room was nice I shudder to think of the cost vs benefit of that room  We could hear the guy in the next room talking on his phone and what he was watching on tv  
N => First Class Absolute first class all the way  Check in started the second my car door was opened by a hotel staff member at the valet parking area  My key card was ready by the time I got to the check in desk and with a quick swipe of my credit card I was escorted to the elevator where my bagage and a bell boy were waiting  The room was perfect in every sense  I struggled to find some minor thing that was not perfect I couldnt find anything  My room was cleaned twice daily I never saw the maid  Valet parking was perfect  Every individual I encountered went out of their way to give me anything I had requested  
N => Awesome The rooms at the Park Hyatt are to die for in my opinion  They are just my style  Warm ultra modern and clean  Wish I could afford to stay here more often  
N => Large but nice  
N => Almost didnt want to leave the room  
N => A first class experience  
N => We were very comfortable for a very reasonable price  We stay at this hotel every time we visit Chicago  It is close to everything we want to see in the city but the price feels more like what we would pay to stay in a far away suburb  Parking at the hotel is free and that cuts the price even more  We have never had a negative experience at the Ramada Inn Lakeshore Drive and we dont even bother shopping around anymore  
N => Would not recommend The staff was very friendly and the location is great  The room itself was terrible  The first room we were put in smelled like something had died in it  The AC did not work  The quotfridgequot did not work either  We were moved to another room down the hall  It did not smell  The AC did not work in this room either  The quotfridgequot kept our food cold when the housekeeper didnt shut it off The hotels brochure state that they have Pillow tip mattresses  They did not in the  rooms we were in  It was the HARDEST bed that I have ever tried to sleep on  The guest rooms were in dire need of a good remodel  The bath room had been updated  
N => Good if you only need a place to sleep I stayed at this hotel for two nights when I visited the University of Chicago  This hotel seems to be the only hotel near the University  Not being familiar with the area this hotel was the only choice I had  The hotel is actually NOT close to the University  However the hotel had shuttles which take you to the University  I used the shuttle service only once when the driver was in the lobby when I was waiting at the front desk to ask the direction to the bus stop  However if she hadnt been there and called me I wouldnt have known that there was such services  Neither the receptionist nor the pamphlet in the room did not tell me about this  Also not told was the fact that the ROOM DIDNT INCLUDE BREAKFAST  The receptionist told where the cafe was so I simply assumed that I could have complimentary breakfast there  As a result I had to spend about  more than I had planned  But for the receptionists poor communication at the time of check in my stay was confortable overall  You can have a good stay but no hospitality and no breakfast included  
N => Worst of the Worst Our family reunion was held at this Ramada Inn  We blocked off  rooms  We was not offerered any discount for the amount of business we were giving them  I had nevered spent  on a room a night so I was expecting something along the lines of  to  stars  I got a Motel   With me being military I have traveled acrossed the US Asia and Europe  Hands down this is the worst Ive seen  The air went out in the middle of the night in the whole building and we had to wait until  am for it to be fixed  Some rooms had electrical problems missing aminities and moldpaint issues  Not worth  a night  The pictures shown on the web site must be from when they first opened  I took a couple pictures of my own to send to the Ramada Franchise Inc  and Lake Shore Hospitality Inc     BEWARE    or you will end up just as upset as myself and the rest of my family coming from different parts of the US  
N => Yuk Visited this hotel in y of   We stayed one night  I was trying to save a little money before going directly into downtown Chicago the next night  This place was pathetic  Not friendly at all and I felt sort of creeped out ha as did the rest in our party  We had two rooms  Part of the curtain was hanging down in my room cigarette burns on the sinks cracks in the ceiling  The air conditioner was broke in the second room and they did move them to another room  It was rather dingy and seemed like s or  I have been a little spoiled as we usually stay at a Hilton but this place was nasty  I would never go back again and wish I had spent the extra money for a little nicer place  
N => Stay Downtown Chicago if your at a convention not worth the savings Booked a hotel room online for the Ramada  It was a little less expensive then staying downtown  First problem I had was when I called the hotel and asked how to get to the hotel from the ORD airport using public transporation  The lady said it was not possible and to take an airport shuttle or taxi  So off I went and took the blue line from the airport and got off and took the   bus and got off where the driver told me to and walked  blocks  total price was   for the subway and   transfer to the bus next problem was the hotel room  It was really old and dated kinda like furniture you would see at goodwill  or was not the nicest  This was livable although my girlfriend did not like it and felt quotdirtyquot during our stay  Good thing we were only here one night next problem was that on their web site it states quotThe Ramada Lake Shore a great Chicago Hotel located just five minutes from McCormick Place offers a free shuttle service to and from the hotel to the Chicago Convention Center on a daily basis quot which would lead one to believe that they have a constant supply of shuttles running to and from the McCormick Place convention center a reason why I booked the room  Well we get there and then they say quotour shuttle runs downtownquot and we can drop you foff at Mccormick  I booked this hotel because of the statement on their web site because I was going to a convention while in town  So they tell me they have two shuttles one at  and one at  to drop me off at Mccormick but can PROVIDE NO PICKUP from McCormick  and to take a taxi back  for one my events started at am at McCormick and there was no pickup My girlfriend was not happy about navigating public transportation to get back to the hotel at night Another problem was with the internet connection  On the ramada corporate web site when I booked the room it states HIGH SPEED INTERNET  When I got to the hotel there was no internet available in the room and I asked the front desk and they said it was only available in the lobby  Those were all not that significat problems and were able to be worked around  The biggest problem was that the hotel door did not latch without pulling up on the door and then the door looked as it had been broken in and repaird by putting a piece of wood infront so someone would not be able to stick a screwdriver or credit card to jimmy open the door  When my girlfriend left the room she did not realize you had to do this and when I got back we pushed the door open to get in without using the key or even turning the door handle  All our stuff in the room was at risk to be stolen or worst have a breakin where we could be personally harmed  In addition the neighborhood this hotel was in didnt look like the best neighborhood in Chicago So I went to the front desk to report the problems with the door lock and to get into a different room and before me heard the front desk lady tell two other people the hotel is sold out and there are no rooms available  so we just quotdeltquot with it In addition the hotel is under reation and the lobby was under construction and the retaurant on property was closed If I were you I would avoid the Ramada in Chicago  I thought I would save some money by staying here but it was far away from everything shopping etc and was not worth the savings  
N => Lost a customer Before we booked our room online  We made sure to check and see if the rooms had wi fi  The website for Ramada Lake Shore Said that in fact indeed their was in room Wi fi  We also checked about a refidgerator and was told their was one in room as well  When we arrived not only was the lobby and hotel torn up for renavitionwhich their should have been notice of posted on the website  But their was no in room wi fi and only a small cooler built into a broken piece of furniture instead of a refridgerator  The furniture in the room was broken down scratced up and in poor condition  This is not acceptable for   a night  We were going to stay for three nights but instead spent one night because we arrived late in the evening  We stay in hotels  to  times a year  This was our first time and our last time at ramada  
N => It was good for us We chose the Ramada Inn because it was close to the Museum of Science and Industry  We were also pleased that there was a free shuttle that could take us downtown We got to check in a little early and the next shuttle was leaving in  minutes  We rode it to Shedd Aquarium  The shuttle is gross but the driver was great very friendly and knowledgeable about Chicago  The room was fine  However there is no fan in the bathroom and you are not able to turn on air conditioning   only heat  So it got really hot in the room and we had to open a window even though it was late ember The restaurant next to the hotel is okay  Nothing great but convenient We paid a little over  a night to stay here  Travelocity had a special  So for that money   it was great  I would prefer to stay downtown but I dont have hundreds of dollars to spend  
N => Worst hotel I have ever been to When we were planning a vacation through Chicago I chose the Ramada because I have always had nice experiences at Ramada and this one had a free shuttle that would take us around the city  When we arrived we learned that the shuttle was broken  No one at the front desk was able to give us any assisstance on exactly how we were going to get around and since we had never been to Chicago we did not know directions  We had to go to a gas station and buy a map  Our room was dirty and the shower did not drain  The cleaning staff apparently stole the pillows we brought from home and the front desk staff again would not assist us  The only good I found at the Ramada was the location close to Lake Michigan you can walk right across to it and the resturant food was very good  But no matter what    do not stay here  
N => a towel with boo boo in the hallway next to room  laying on the floor my  year old son has very bad asthmathe dor at uic of chicago was testing some new medicne for his asthma sothey wanted us to stay close by so i rent a room at ramadahotel on lake shore drive  the st room he was coughing badso i asked if could give me another room all the room she showed my was  worst then the st including the one with the towel with boo boo so we ided keep the frist one i had to buy a puirferand prayed for the days to pass in the end i meet two very nice lady who worked in the dinning area whom made us feel very special but the rooms need helpi you have any family member who have lung problem the ramada inn is not a good place to be  
N => Agree with Never Again This hotel is a total dump  My family stayed here on the weekend of il th  The staff was rude and unprofessional  The shower did not drain so they had to stand in water to shower  The rooms were dingy  We tried filing a complaint with Ramada but they responded that since its a franchise theres nothing they can do  We will never stay at this or any other Ramada in the future as a result of this horrid stay  
N => a trade off not bad First this is NOT within walking distance of downtown attractions about  miles  We got free parking in thier garage but had to be back by  or get locked out  The shuttle had  or three specific out bound to town times none of which were convenient for us during our  hour stay and they do not go to Sears Tower where we wanted to go  The place was plain but clean amp comfortable the view of the water was awesome but our AC controls were backward  When we tried to make it warmer it got colder didnt figure this out until the next day when I called to ask for an extra blanket this great big hotel with lots of empty beds said they didnt have any others No apologies amp no effort or desire to help us out on this one  We didnt swim but we did check out the pool amp it looked pretty good didnt try the restaurant  We had a pretty good experience with a clean room amp you cant beat the free parking  Providing the weather was good the outdoor pool would have been great to keep the kids entertained if necessary  Not the most glamourous or professional place but I chose this location for these amenities amp they delivered  Relatively cheap close to downtown shuttle parking amp pool ok staff older but servicable feel to the clean room amp grounds cute neighborhood  They were slow that night I wonder what it would be like if they were very busy  Its a trade off  
N => Comfortable place I was really apprehensive and worried after reading the negative reviews online and after an encounter with a rather rude staff over the phone before my trip  but i have no other choice because this is really the nearest hotel to UoC  So Im really thankful that nothing unfortunate happened during my stay Tthe room is comfortable  Breakfast was rather good too  We tried the seafood buffet on friday night though the seafood IMO is not very fresh  The receptionists were generally quite helpful  Shuttle bus driver was quite friendly too but must remember to call mins before hand to ensure pick up  In general I enjoyed my  nights stay there  
N => NIGHTE HORRIBLE PLACE  Terrible service  Incompetent and rude staff  Long lines with no apologies or acknowledgement of problems  One small example I Asked for non smoking room and was put in smoking room  When I nicely explained to the one person working she was irritated and angry that I did not accept the room  No sense of customer service whatsoever  The problems I had here are too long to write  Suffice to say STAY AWAY  There are many other excellent choices for hotels in the area 
N => hotel nice management not My stay at the ramada was nice  The rooms were comfortable and I loved the bathrooms  Room service did a terrific job  But the management and customer service were not helpful or understanding at all  Everything was going lovely until the day of my check out  It was only two people in linewhich I was one of them and after they checked in the first couple They had me just standing there for about a good minutes waiting to check out  I didnt say anything because i wanted to see how long i was going to stand there so finally I said quotCould someone please check me outquot  And thats when management said quotoh step down here  She tried to send me to jail for phone callswhich i didnt know they charge you for anywayif the calls dosent go through  She really treated like I was a Crimnal for phone calls that were   When she showed the phone calls to securityyes she called securityhis response was quotthats it   let her mail the payment in  Which i did because I saw how she was pushing the issue of me going to jail  And she did all of this in front of my year old dhter  I would stay at the ramada inn again but not if the same manager is on duty  And let me add she had a trainee  
N => Never again Because we pre paid our hotel for a week in Chicago we could not get out of it  It was very depressing to come home to each night  The outside parking garage attached to the hotel was a nighe  Old mattresses were lined up against the wall the floor was filthy the ceiling was peeling and the lobby was dismal  The corridors were ugly and not clean  However the only good thing was that our room was not bad  It had been redone and once we were in our room I tried to forget the rest of the hotel  Since they provided a shuttle to main attractions in Chicago we ided to stay there  On the fourth day the shuttle driver was sick and just didnt show and no one at the front desk bothered to inform the  patrons that were waiting to take the morning shuttle into town  I loved Chicago and would definitely return but never stay at this Ramada Inn  
N => Ramada Inn Lake Shore is a joke This hotel or motel is not one to be considered by anyone who requires to be reasonbly accommodated  The rooms are small and lack any kind of atmosphere  Dont even think of staying here if its cold outside  The Lake Michigan exposure means just that  You will find the rooms and the managment cold Its run by the Patel family I stayed there one St  Valentines Day  Worst mistake I could have made  I used my Diners Club card to secure the room explaining that I would be paying cash at check out  Not only did they take my cash they charged my credit card as well  I was given a receipt that didnt match my room so when I approached them about the mistake they told me that I couldnt prove that I had given them any cash because the receipt was for another room number  Ramadas corporate offices didnt even acknowledge my letter of complaint  My advice is to steer clear of this one 
N => Not like the ad but not a bad place to stay  My husband and I arrived about midnight and got our room  air conditioned king bed non smoking first floor  After reading reviews I was very apprehensive and almost cancelled our reservation  Glad I didnt as the room was large clean and what I requested  The staff was helpful but we found out information on our own  Taking the hotels free van into the city Palmer House stop we purchased a  day CTA pass for busses and the quotElquot at the gift store in the Cultural Center on Michigan Avenue  Each night we took bus   to Hyde Park from State Street and walked to our hotel  The suburb of Hyde Park was interesting and we ate at Mellow Yellow several times  We walked about  blocks to the Museum of Science and Industry and was very impressed  If you know how to get around with public transportation the hotel is good  Its not fancy but we had an average hotel room  
N => Dont do it for even   per night Well add this to the long list of compliments about this dump The room we got was quotsmokingquot not non smoking as we had reserved  The room smelled so strong of smoke that we did not sleep at all and left at am the next morning  We were there to see our grandhter in the National Cheerleading Program at the Navy Pier  This dump ruined our entire concept of Chicago  I contacted my Credit Card company and had them remove the charge from my account       DONT GO THERE DONT CALL THERE AND DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT STAYING THERE Neither Hotels Nor the management at the quotDUMPquot have returned my emails or responded to my written complaints            
N => Stay here only if you prefer to stay in a dump DO NOT WASTE A PENNY OF YOUR MONEY BY STAYING AT THIS DUMP What a waste of a good location  This Ramada Inn is in horrible condition and the management have obviously let it go to the point that it now needs to be completely bulldozed  They are NOW in construction course it was not posted anywhere on their site nor was it posted at the hotel  They feel they can still charge customers FULL PRICE for truly slum conditions  Where to begin Loose bathroom tiles  inch grit on the bathtubshower floor that I had to CLEAN out before using the tubshower wake up call of the sound of demolitionjack hammer at  am with workers lhter and cursing when I banged on the wall back to them and the door locking mechanism was BROKEN yes BROKEN The bedspreads had cigarette burns in them and huge holes and it was actually shredded The carpeting was horribly stained  I have stayed at BETTER Super s and Motel s in my time than this dump  Dont waste your money 
N => Could be worse always could be worse though  
N => Dont Go  
N => very very bad  
N => awful hotel tho close to U of C  
N => Ramada Inn Lake Shore  
N => The crew at this hotel makes your stay worthwhile   especially Ms  Robinson Great staff  Great location  Needs reation but all in all a great place to stay  
N => Youve got to include this hotel when you go to Chicago Downtown Perfect location with perfect value Walking distance to Navy Pier  Just one block away from Michigan ave  
N => Great trip to Chicago This was my first time in Chicago we came for a Cubs game  After reading several negative reviews we were very hesitate about staying at this hotel but we were pleasantly surprised  We checked in at about pm on a Thursday it was very quick  We had a king room on the th floor  It had a nice flat screen tv amp a small desk  The elevators amp hallways are very small but   I didnt go to Chicago to spend time in them  The room was more then big enough for my husband amp I  I dont know what their double rooms are like but I could see that be  beds in a room might be a bit tight for a family of   However for as little time spent in the room I dont think it would be a big deal  If planning to be in the room for long amounts of time I probably would spend a bit more for a nicer hotel  The elevators amp hallways are very small but again   not there to spend a lot of time in the hotel  The location of this hotel cant be beat especially for the price  Just steps from Michigan Ave amp Magnificent Mile shopping amp we were able to easily walk to about everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel  The only real negatives I have about the hotel room are this the carpet seemed quite dingy with a big pink stain in the corner the bathroom needed a bit of deep cleaning ie  walls aroundbelow sink amp the grout in the shower needed to be scrubbed  This is a no frills place    if youre on a budget amp looking for a place to change clothes amp sleep at this is a great value  I really cant complain about anything considering we paid only  night thru Priceline   you cant beat that for the heart of Chicago Food amp drinks in downtown Chicago can be pricey so I recommend the TGI Fridays that is on the other side of the block from the hotel on Erie St  They have a very nice bar area amp drink specials every day of the week  We didnt find this place until our last day amp wished we had much earlier  Great place to sit watch a game amp have a drink after a long day of walking  We also stopped by the Signature Lounge on the th floor of the Hancock Bldg  for a drink  Instead of paying  person to go to their observation k we went to the lounge amp had a drink  Drinks are pricey but you get a great drink while enjoying the great view  I recommend going during the afternoon to avoid the crowds for your best chance at a seat by the window  There is also a McDonalds amp a Walgreens about  blocks west on the same street as the hotel  Also to be checked out Maggianos Restaurant great food reasonable prices Navy Pier for fireworks at night Billy Goat Tavern for a drink Second City comedy club great show We were really impressed as to how easy everything was to get to either by walking or public transit  We ordered a  day pass from the CTA website prior to our trip  They were mailed to our house included in price amp dont activate until the first time you use them  They are good for unlimited rides on the bus amp el train  Use Google Maps for directions it is connected to the transit authority amp will map your way for walking or public transit giving you the correct bus   or train amp how to get to the correct bus stop  We used it on our Blackberry amp it worked great We had one of our best trips ever amp the hotel was great for what we needed it for  We would stay here again amp Im sure we will  
N => Was a Good Value For the Price On a spur of the moment I ided to go to Chicago to see Paul Potts and wanted an inexpensive place to stay  The hotels location is ideal being only one block off Michigan  The room I had was a corner room was rather small and sparse but it was clean  For the price level you got the amenities you expected small bar of soap plastic wrapped plastic glass shampoo in a package similar to ketchup pack  It was adequate and since it was just me the room was large enough  I had not read all the negative reviews of the hotel but found the staff helpful  I dont have any complaints  If you are looking for basic hotel serices at a great price from Priceline this is the place  
N => DO NOT stay here cockroachs black moldmildew in bathroom staff allow panhandlers into lobby room is dirty even after staff cleaned more like just replaced the towels 
N => Ok hotel but would pay more to stay somewhere nicer next time  We stayed with my  dhters  amp  for an overnight fun trip in Chicago  We booked on priceline amp got a great rate so I suppose you get what you pay for  I had been reading others reviews on the hotel amp honestly was terrified on what wed find when we arrived  I was prepared to forego my money amp just head home if it was as bad as others had said  I was pleased to see that our room was clean when we arrived  Although I couldnt wait to get out of there because it was so SMALL  We were all tripping over one another amp really felt trapped almost  The check in staff was very nice amp friendly as was the valet  It is definitely a  star hotel so dont expect extra perks or luxury features  However I was at least thankful that our room was clean  Lesson learned however it was nice to spend less but at the end of the day Id just assumed have paid  more amp stayed in a better quality hotel  The location was great though right by everything in the heart of the downtown  We probably wont return again though  
N => Great area wouldnt stay here again though I stayed with a coach group and found that the hotel was dirty and the staff rude be because we were in a group they didnt seem to care  The carpet in the hallway on our level was filthy andor stained  Our room was OK but I was too afraid to touch anything  The bathroom seemed fine  The lobby was TINY but I guess there wasnt much else they could do with the space  The bonus coffee and flat screen telly in the foyer were nice  It was close to everything but the standoffish attitude of the staff and the stained carpets have stuck in my mind  
N => A very good option try it and you wont be disappointed Dear travelerI had a real pleasure to spend some days in this hotel  I must confess I read the comments about this hotel only after booking it  Therefore before getting there I was scared to death  But after arriving I had a great wonderful surprise  Everything was perfect clean room good conditions with regard to the price best location very friendly staff people  As a world traveler I had spent days at great hotels i e  Ritz Four seasons Hilton Hyatt Best Western Fairmont Sheraton etc   So do not expect to find the luxury here  But for the price you pay and the location you should be very confident  Again do not hesitate to choose this hotel and youll be very pleased  I had no complains on the contrary  Good luck 
N => Cramped Rooms Bad Tempature Regulation I stayed here one night in late ember   The service was friendly but when we got up to the room we turned on the heater it was in the s outside and within an hour the room was still cold  We told the front desk and when we got back the room was too hot Also the beds seemed old and the room was tiny  This hotel takes people under  and is a GREAT location but the rooms were pretty bad You have to purchase a T mobile hot spot to get wireless  
N => So Filthy had to shower standing on a towel Shower floor had thick shelack of filth and grime and god knows what else  Feet sticking to floor in shower Thin throw blanket only on bed along with dirty bed spread  Hard to argue with price and location but even a one night stay was unbearable  Lastly were instructed the valet would need  minutes to get car   we waited an hour a fitting end to our stay  
N => good location and nothing else Room   Seal on toilet on floor was leaking  Bathroom floor was constantly wet with urinewater  The entire bathroom absolutely reeked of urine from the moment we arrived  I cannot believe that a housekeeper cleaning that room would not have noticed this  Given the strength of the smell it must have been going on for weeks or even longer  Drunks in the hall kept us up half the night  Floors were dirty  We slept in our clothes  This was a block off of Michigan Ave this would have received a quotterriblequot rating from me otherwise and the price was cheap   on Priceline  but I would never stay here again  Spend the extra  and stay somewhere that doesnt turn your stomach  
N => Ughhhh The most deplorable conditions I have ever encountered in a hotel anywhere  The room had a window that was jammed open the heater didnt work no hot water filthy carpets and a huge stain on the comforter that looked like blood  Had to sleep wearing a coat The front desk said they could not move us to another room because they were fully booked  They said they would send someone up to make repairs but never did  Management says they will be starting reations soon but DO NOT reserve a room in this hotel unless you are guaranteed a reated room or can see the room for yourself first  
N => Worst hotel ever Im not kidding This hotel advertises quotSurprising luxury at affordable ratesquot This is a bold lie there is not one bit of luxury at this hotel Carpets are FILTHY dont take your shoes off One elevator broke down and the Chicago fire dept  had to rescue stuck people Elevator stopped on every floor going up and down  This was not due to someone pressing all the buttons as this happened for  days straight day and night  The front desk was notified by dozens of customers and still nothing was done There was vomit next to one of the beds upon check inThe hallways look like a dark cell block and the rooms are smaller and dirtier than a cellAbsolutely disgusting please please take my advice and stay elsewhere I would not stay in this hotel again if it was complimentary 
N => Disgusting I arrived for a two night stay at this hotel on  tember  as a member of a coach tour looking forward to a comfortable room before travelling across to Los Angeles  What did I find Carpets in corridors were absolutely filthy no facilities for a hot drink in rooms only from machine in lobby between certain hours overall oration dirty and dingy trouble with door lock air conditioning very noisy could not regulate temperature and it still made a noise even when switched off sockets nearly off the walls hair dryer not working ceiling in top floor corridor leaking quite badly and to crown it all the toilet was not fixed to the floor so it moved and rocked everytime I sat on it Apart from being near to the Magnificent Mile shops this hotel has absolutely nothing going for it  In fact my opion is that it should be closed down it is just so bad  I just wish that I had taken photographs to prove just how unsavoury this hotel is  
N => Worst value in Chicago Wow this is the first time Ive written a review just to tell how bad a hotel was  Its not so much that the hotel was a dump its the value of it  We paid nearly  for our quotking suitequot which was really more than we had wanted to spend but it was the last minute so we just figured wed suck it up and at least enjoy a nicer hotel than wed typically book No luck there This was a drab uncomfortable hotel  Linens carpet furniture everything were bottom of the barrel and worn out on top of it  The bed was uncomfortable and the room smelled funny  The toilet clogged our first night there    which I think it would have done even if all Id used it for was to clip my toenails over    and it never got fixed luckily there was another toilet in the room because it was a suite  That one was equally weak so I used it reeeeeeeeeeeally conservatively  Should I have to count pieces of toilet paper in a  a night hotelTo their credit the front desk did give me toothbrushes when I told them we forgot ours  That was the highlight of our stay If you are forced to spend your pennies in this place at least get a room on a lower floor  We were on the th and even when it made no stops the elevator took so long to get to the darn lobby and back that I almost didnt want to run down to get a cup of coffee in the morning  I was especially irritated when I found they were out of cups  
N => The Worst Red Roof I Ever Stayed In I booked the room on the Red Roof website but when I arrived even with my quotconfirmation numberquot the people at the desk could not find my reservation  I still got the room at the rate I was promised though On the other hand it was not a pleasant experience  The room smelled like dirty socks that had no place to air out  So I turned on the ac full blast as I unloaded the car from downstairs  Speaking of the downstairs loading zone the valet parking attendant suggested that I give him my car keys so he could move my car in case the police ided to tow my car since I was parked halfway into the loading zone and halfway out  I quickly figured out that the car that dominated the loading zone was HIS because I saw him taking a couple of smoke breaks in it while I was dealing with the problems at the registration desk  I ided I would take my chances with the police rather than trust this guy with my keys I had to park across the street and down a ways in the lot for another hotel  It was not easy to get to because of the series of one way streets I had to go around a couple of blocks to get to it even though it was a short walk from the Inn Returning to the room I found that the phone did not work and several tiles were missing from the bathroom walls and floors  The hallways were dingy and the carpet unclean  The elevators were slow and small but necessary for a  story building  I had to go down six floors to find an ice machine Ive stayed at many Red Roof Inns in different cities   They tend to be quotcookie cutterquot copies kind of boring but at least you know what to expect  But not this one  While I would stay at another Red Roof Inn I would avoid this one like the plague  
N => bad experience worth the price Located on Ontario and N St Clair  this hotel is a perfect spot to walk to Navy Pier Michigan Ave shopping and even cross the river  Our stay however was not good  A pipe had broke in the hotel a day earlier and it smelt like stale washclothes  In our room the sink was clogged their was mold on the ceiling and the table was dirty  With much effort we were switched to a different room  It is a dingy place but for the location it is worth the cheap price we payed  
N => Horrible My boyfriend and I were attending a wedding taking place on Michigan Avenue the weekend of  th   The groom of the wedding advised us that The Red Roof Inn would be perfect since it was only a  blocks away from where the wedding was and it is in such a prime location a block away from Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile  So we followed his advise bc we thought it was such a good deal especially wthe prices there   well you certainly get what you pay for The service we received at the front desk was excellent  Even whow busy they were the  woman working there was on top of everything and very friendly  However the room itself was horrible The bathroom floor was stained brown in multiple places and it smelled like dirty feet  We tried to prop up the bathroom door to air it out but there was no where for the smell to go since the windows were bolted shut  I dont know how to describe it but the room was just plain dirty I felt gross just being there  Also I know that the information about the velet parking states that you should take all of your values out of your car but I had no idea it was possibly bc of the velet employees I figured they were just concerned in the case that your car was broken into  We arrived on Friday afternoon and left on Sunday morning  The whole time we were there the car was in the hotels parking garage  As far as we know the velet employees were the only ones in the car bc there was no signs of a break in  We had quite a bit of luggage and when we first arrived we were unable to take EVERYTHING out of the car  So we left a bag of snacksbeverages in the backseat we were driving from IA so we stocked up for the car ride to Chicago and a small tin wchange in it for all the tolls  However when we got our car back on Sunday we had a Red Bull   in quarters and  in dimes missing out of our car I felt it odd that someone would break in and steal just these random items and not the car stereo all of the money change or all of the foodbeverages left in the car  I know theres no way to prove it was the employees but it just seems too strange for anyone else  
N => would never stay again website stated was recently reated but was not  carpet was stained and filthy  We had a room on the th floor and there were ants in the room  There was mildewmold in the shower  Housekeeping did not make the beds they changed towels and did nothing else  We talked with the manager on the phone and he said he would talk with us when we checked out but that morning he was unavailable  We would have switched hotels but there was a conference in town and hotels were booked  This hotel has a great location but that is all it has going for it  Very disappointing  
N => Small but Nice  I arrived early in Chicago but they let me check in anyway  The hotel itself is a bit on the small side but the king suite had plenty of room  I did not have any noisy neighbors so I had a good nights sleep  If I return to Chicago again I will be staying here  The price  on their website was well within my budget and from talking to other participants in the summit I was in much nicer than the  quotclosetquot as one member desbcribed his room that others paid at the Hyatt regency  
N => Not that Bad We read a lot of the negative reviews after we had booked this hotel  We called the property to discuss our concerns and they assured that our room would be well taken care of during our stay  The room was fairly clean but rather small  The bathroom was acceptable but there wasnt much counter space and made getting ready a little difficult The price avg tax for three nights and location more than made up for the size of the room  For a big city this was not too bad  
N => Deplorable conditions terrible customer service You know those hotels where everything goes wrong This was it  Disgusting old rooms  The hotel seems to be under the impression that if there is a flat panel TV in the lobby that makes rooms wired with extension cords run under the carpet and yellow wallpaper acceptable  No hot water in the morning  We checked out and had to check in to another hotel  They quotcompedquot our rooms  Then mysterious charges appeared on our credit cards  By early ember they had resolved the credit card issues  Location near Michigan Ave  was obviously excellent but it doesnt make up for such a truly awful hotel  
N => nice location nothing else A girls weekend the four of us checked in On Friday  When we started to unpack we notice a leak under the bathroom sink apparently it had been there a while because of the rust stains Then we notice the room was not fully vacuum and dirt around the edge of the bathroom floor  So we asked to be moved to another room  We looked at five total and ided that our room  happened to be the cleanest of the six  We stay put until Saturday afternoon  We had packages to drop off drop and the room across the hall was being clean we looked at it and asked if we could move to  and not be charged anything extra  Yes the manager said  When we checked out Monday morning they wanted to charge us   more than what was agreed at check in  After talking with two managers at the same time one being the manager from Sat and  minutes later we were not charged the extra amount Only two ice machines where working one on floor  and one on floor   There are two coffee machines in the lobby however only one of them worked  
N => Dirty room Great location staff helpful re  ac that didnt work  We were prepared for old grungy room but not for the dirthairwhatever in the corners and all around the edge of the carpet    also something splashed on headboard of one bed  Bathroom was clean but toilet seat not well attached on one side  They did give a  adjustment   nights therewhen we mentioned the dirty room    we will try very hard to come up with something else next time 
N => Small Rooms Loud Noises  but close to everything Our first stop on our tour of the South was in Chicago at the Red Roof Inn  I was a little surprised to find quiet a small room when I opened the door  The room was ok and seems clean enough  I did notice the way the bathroom door did not stay open and slammed shut everytime one entered or exited the bathroom  You could also not expect to open the bathroom door and room door at the same time as there was not enough room to open both  We also had a street side room and noticed the quotsingingquot of fire enginesambulances constantly all through the night  As for location this was by far the best hotel for that We could walk outside turn the corner and hit the quotmagnificent milequot shops water tower place hancock observatory wrigley building and restaurants were very abundant as was a Traders Joe for picking up any fresh fruit or bottled water  I must make note that one of the staff members an asian girl at the front desk was very unfriendly and unaccomadating  Could use a little lesson in customer service  While not a stellar hotel location was definately a plus 
N => Not even good enough for my dog  WE stay at many USA hotels and this by far was one of the worst  We stayed one night and checked out and checked in across the street at the riott Courtyard  We were part of a wedding party and had multiple rooms reserved  Many family members ended up following us to the riott for the remainder of their stay  Upon check in at the Red Roof Inn the check in procedure was disorganized long and unimpressive  The elevators was not working and we had to tow our own luggage up the stairs  When we reached the correct floor we were unable to find our room due to missing room numbers  Finally finding our no number room we entered into a very small room with two double beds that had dirty sheets and wrinkled sheets that obviously had been used before  There were not enough staff to bring us new sheets we had to get new sheets from the front desk ourselves  We had to make both beds ourselves  The door jam had been forced before and the jam broken  The halls and room were in much need of reations  The air unit was very noisey with a matallic banging noise all night we were unable to get any sleep  We had to shut off the air and did not open the window because we were above an outdoor cafe and the chatter from the cafe was loud even with the windows closed could not imagine how noisey it would be if the windows were opened  That is even if the windows could open  We checked out the very next morning and was given a full refund  So awful of a place and would not recommend this hotel even though the location was superb  We have stayed at other Red Roof hotels around the country and never had such a unpleasant experience with inferior accomendations  
N => Wouldnt stay here again The location is perfect and the staff were pleasant enough but the rooms are ridiculously small  This was bearable but my biggest beef is with housekeeping  We stayed from Thursday to Monday and we had maid service only once after specifically requesting it  They made the bed and replaced the towels but didnt empty the trash or clean the bathroom  The second time they showed up they thought the room was vacant and so they walked right in to find me standing in nothing but a towel  For the rest of our stay we just walked into the housekeeping closet and helped ourselves to clean towels Its a fine enough place otherwise  But dont expect to come back to clean room at the end of the day  Im not especially picky but for  CAD per night I expect the bed to be made clean towels and the trash to be taken out  
N => Get Out While You Can About the only pro was that they allowed my party to check in early  Cons The price I was given for my room was not the price I was charged  I was actually charged   more a night  Problem was fixed after four straight days of trying to talk to a manager  They kept blowing me off that did not make me happy The first room I was given had problems with the water draining out of the bath tub The second room was smaller than my first room which I could hardly imagine anything smaller than room  but they did it When we closed the curtain gnats came out The bathroom had a horrible odor Only one elevator worked and it was slow  They had to call the fire department because something happened to it The beds were the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on  You might as well have been sleeping on the floor  The towels and wash cloths were terrible  They were extremely rough and thin  Overall this was a horrible hotel  I understand that the price was low for the location  However this is no excuse for any of the above  
N => Lots of issues  all bad We ended up with one of the quotbadquot rooms that others have mentioned  Toilet tank half open and what you could see inside was a rank combo of mildew and dirt  Generally dirty bathroom with sink and shower not wanting to drain  Dirty carpet that left our socks black and a musty smell and really loud air conditioner  I went downstairs and asked for an upgrade and there were no other rooms to be had  The clerk was honest enough to say that about half the rooms had been refurbished so if you must stay here ask for a refurbished room  When I went to check out the clerk refused to check me out because he was running late to get to his day job  He left the front desk unattended and I had to wait  minutes for a new clerk to arrive  Also do not store your luggage here  When you ask to get your stored luggage they hand you a key and you get it yourself  I could have taken anything I fancied  
N => great location   good night sleep We attended from Ohio for a wedding  Compared to other area prices it was a steal  I planned only to cleanse and sleep in my room and it was more than adequate  Plan to return in the fall to enjoy more of the city  
N => Got what we expected  ent great local  Read all reviews here so we were a little nervous but were pleasently surprised  We paid  a night with Sams Club membership We only spent time in the room to sleep but that is all we needed it for We were within walking distance of Navy Pier Broadway in Chicago Milineum Park Sears Tower amp the Hancock Building etc  Valet parked our car and we never used it again for the next  days Only complaint is the elevator was very slow amp small  We were on the th floor and it took a while for the thing to get to the lobby  Room was very small but again we only used to sleep amp bath I will definetly go back  The price was less than half of the next cheapest we could find  
N => Cant beat the location but wouldnt stay again for anything Like others have noted the reason to stay here is the price and location alone  Dont expect any extras unless you consider a hair dryer and AC big perks  Room was small and wasnt that clean and the housekeeper didnt bother to come until our third day there  The shower did not drain  disgusting  and housekeeping could not fix it  AC was full blast or nothing We came with our toddler and received a crib but it was stained and old  No refrigerator in our quotstandardquot room either  Not the best place to bring young children but we survived  There is an Italian restaurant there but notfor families with young ones  To their credit when checking out I mentioned the drain problem and I recd an  credit adjustment  
N => Good hotel no problems at all We have stayed at the Red Roof Inn for  days early   I hesitated for a long time to stay here because of all the bad comments  But for us it was a pleasant surprise  Location perfect Reception very nice and helpfull  We arrived too early and the room we booked had not been cleaned  We left our baggage and came back after lunch about   p m Because the room was still not ready they offered us an upgrade to a bigger room without any costs  A nice corner room with  beds a desk and  chairs  Everything was clean So no complaints at all for    per nightWe would come back here again  
N => Couldnt wait to leave I should have known better after reading some other comments but I thought Id take a chance      big mistake         filthy   walk barefoot on the carpeting and the bottom of your feet are blackened       small does not define the bathroomnot even compared to some in Europe    part of the wall under the shower came crashing into the tub    what an experience      never thought I could say this but I would have rather paid to stay somewhere else than stay there for free 
N => Value Hotel Stands on Excellent Location i stayed there for  nights that was good experience  All of the hotel was average  My room at nd floor was not spacious but okey  Staffs were not so helpful but polite enough Although only  block distance from Magnificent Mile the rate had so much value  So I recommend this hotel for economy travellers  
N => Downtown location not as shown on website Room was not as featured on website  Too small for conference stay   no desk or chair    barely enough room for the beds  Not vacuumed prior to arrival  required a call to housekeeping  Refills of daily needs had to be requested  shampoo glasses toilet paper  Nice folksworking there though  Location was good for conference shopping restaurants  If money is your only concern this is the place  Otherwise we recommend that you call for reservations and ensure that the room meets your needs  There are larger rooms but paying in advance prevented us from upgrading our room which we attempted to do  
N => Disliked the Red Roof Inn Chicago Red Roof Inn ChicagoIllinois Ontario St quotNot so cleanDate il th Reviewer VistorOur family just returned from our trip to Chicago  We stayed in the Red Roof Inn  The first night we stayed there it was okay  When we woke up the next morning my son had really big bumps on his leg all over My mom went to the front desk and asked them if they clean the beds a lot They said they change them daily  We went to sleep the next night and he still had them but worse  We asked them about it and they said they are pet friendly  When we left they wernt concered about it  We really didnt like our stay at the Red Roof Inn  
N => Not Worth the Savings My husband and I got a quotVIPquotpass at any Red Roof Inn because we had such a DREADFUL stay in the St  Louis location LAST year  We ided to try the quotRedesigned Rededicated quot Chicago site last weekend  The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it is the location right off Michigan Avenue  If not for that you would think youve landed in some tenement in a seedy side of town We were greeted by the desk clerk in a friendly fashion and given our room keys to our th floor room  We took the elevator to the th floor and found our room in the corner  The room was no larger than a small college dorm room and was about  degrees It was shabbily orated with drab dirty looking bedspreads and non descript walls  We turned on the heat immediately and to our surprise the heater started buzzing very loudly  We both agreed we would NOT be able to sleep through the noise so I asked for another room at the front desk  The clerk seemed surprised that anything was wrong in the first room but gave us keys to another room on the nd floor  I wondered why he didnt give me this room the FIRST time instead of shippng us up to the thWe took our overnight bags to the quotnew improvedquot room to the nd floor to open the elevator door to the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke  Since I had requested a non smoking room this did not bode well  However once we got into our room again in the corner and shut the door the smoke odor was not obtrusive  We ided this room would be quotfinequot for just an overnight stay  It was slightly larger but still very small and drab  The window curtains had to be either SHUT completely or opened to all of the other high rises around as there was no under liner to let in just the light but give you privacy  The room being claustrophobicly small we chose to leave the curtains open until bedtime Bathroom facilities were minimal      tiny sink with no place to put toiletries      old tub and toilet that needed to be replumbed since the toilet quotran onquot all night long even after several attempts to quotjiggle the handlequot  There was a very narrow shelf over the toilet but it leaned down toward the toilet so nothing could be placed here unless you wanted it IN the toilet If all you require is a place to lay your head that is right off the magnificent mile and are not going to be spending any time in your room I suppose this hotel would fit the bill  It IS much cheaper than most  I will say the sheets seemed clean as did the towels but the bedspread was questionable at best Weve ided were going to steer clear of the RED ROOF from here on  Its left a bad taste in our mouths twice in two years  Like the old saying goes quotFool me once shame on you       fool me twice shame on mequot 
N => Budget minded Bliss Nine friends and I ided to stay here while we were in town to run the Chicago Half athon  We all wanted to be near shopping and good dining too  so I suggested the Red Roof Inn Downtown based on other reviews I had read on Trip Advisor  Great Location and great value Rooms were clean and the staff was okay some more accomodating than others  After reading about the small rooms we booked double deluxe rooms four women  room   The size was just fine for our needs  However we could not get rooms next to each other as there is only one doulbe deluxe room per floor  We were able to get a late checkout so that we could shower up after the race before the long ride home  The staff seemed hesitant to grant this request but when we explained the reason why they relented  I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend this place to buget minded travellers  
N => Wonderful location nice rooms great service We visited Chicago for the first time e     y    We booked the Red Roof Inn   Chicago based on price and the reviews on this website and other travel books  It was wonderful  I am used to staying in very nice expensive hotels but I didnt want to pay Four Seasons or Intercontinental prices for this trip  We booked our room for  a night which is a steal  That was with a AAA motor club discount  The location is amazing  It is half a block from the Magnificent Mile it is in a safe well lit area  There are many restaurants near by next door across the street which stay open VERY late  As we have never been to Chicago before but to NYC Boston and LA many times we were not used to city storesrestaurants shutting down early  That wasnt a problem in the area we were  Check in was very quick and easy  We had such a great rate that the front desk man actually asked when we booked because he had not seen a rate that low in ages  He also said they were not participating in the AAA discount anymore which was not a problem for us and we had booked when they still took that discount  We requested a king bed non smoking reated room facing Ontario St  I read in many onlinebook reviews that rooms facing Ontario St had more light and better views  They were nice enough to oblige and we got everything we requested  Our corner room was on the th floor and it was very nice  The only complaint I had was that it smelled musty  I think the smell was coming from the air conditioner  But we got used to it  The room was nicely appointed king bed tv alarm clock night stands desk chairs and it was spotlessly clean  The bed was comfortable and I have a very bad neckback  The view was very nice  We had a view of Michigan Ave from one window and of Ontario St from another window  The bathroom was fine  It definitely was small but clean and the bathshower has a curved rod so there is more room  The room looked just like it did in the pictures online  I would have taken pics for this review but I forgot my cameraThe elevator was small and slow and not air conditioned but that was easy to deal with  They have valets which we did not use and sort of door men who called cabs for us Free coffee hot chocolate tea in the lobby  I would definitely stay here again  
N => I would not reccomend this hotel ever This is not a friendly place to stay  After making reservations months in advancemy husband and I enter our room only to discover that they gave us a queen size bed when I had requested a king  So we hauled our lugage back down to the front desk  I told the employee about the mistake and he told me that there were no more king size rooms avalible  I told him that I wanted the room I had made reserations forI had a confirmation   or a discount on the room that was given to us  After talking with a managervia phoneI was given a key to a king size roomI thought that they were none left  No one apologized to me  The room itself was clean but small  I would not stay at this or any other Red Roof Inn again  
N => Good Deal Stayed here for  days  ided to get the business quot TV and got a pretty spacious room  Suspect by paying a little extra got a slightly bigger room which was more than adequate for the price and well worth it Location is extremely good  The only down side was that the toilet was quotwedgedquot against the wall meaning it was uncomfortable to use  Not sure why this was done as there was plenty of space to move it out a little Would stay here again  
N => interesting find

N => Good place to stay  
N => A great location nothing more nice to say  
N => In centro ma con camere minuscole  
N => Great Hotel with a Great Location What a good experience we had with the Renaissance  We booked on priceline for a really reasonable price  Was so excited to find out we would be staying in downtown at a four star hotel for less than    We went to the U concert at the stadium amazing  It was a bit of a walk but we are young and loved exploring the city  We would absolutely return and recommend  
N => Perfect place to stay in Chicago We could not be more pleased with our three night stay at this lovely hotel  It is the perfect location for walking to all that Chicago has to offer from sightseeing to museums  Our riverview room was wonderful  What a great view to come back to every day amp night  We highly recommend the nearby Shaws Oyster Bar for great food music amp service  
N => Ok for the  If given the option we stay at Renaissance hotels  This hotel wasnt as nice as other Renaissance hotels  No complaints because the price was terrific but I would look at other hotels before booking this one because there are cheaper w   quality  The rooms are small bathrooms are nice size  The lobby was nice the front desk was friendly  However the rooms reminded me of a reated Crowne Plaza  The beds are comfortable but I wasn t impressed with the pillows  We always get upgraded but didn t here  We ordered room service one night and only one meal out of three was correct when you are ordering a  grilled cheese you expect perfection   The pool area was nice but the hot tub didn t have enough water and it took well over hours upon reporting to get filled I don t even know how long because we didn t stay any longer  In short I would recommend this hotel to a friend if it was the right price but there are other hotels I would first recommend  The location is okay but I have enjoyed other locations more too  You might not be disappointed but there are better deals out there  Oh and parking is  per night  
N => Great Location My husband and I enjoyed this hotel  The location on the river was perfect  It was centrally located between theater shopping and touring  It was in a bustling area but the room was very quiet  We were able to take public transportation from the airport and never needed a car  I walked everywhere       waterfront Millennium Park shopping restaurants etc  We only had to walk a block or two to the amazing Oriental Theater to see Wicked  Discount shopping world is within a five minute walk of the hotel Filenes Nordstrom Rack H amp M Loehmanns TJ Maxx among others  Magnificent mile was also within walking distance  I would not miss the boat tour by the Chicago Architectural Foundation  It was right down the street on the river  The service at the hotel was good and the room was great  The bathroom was nicely appointed the bedding was as nice as home and our corner room was very spacious  
N => fabulous wedding reception here at this hotel the wedding reception at this hotel was the best i have ever been to the food the setting which was on the balcony was just breathtakingthe staff could not have done more to make everyone feel welcome thank you 
N => Nice hotel away from Mich Ave hustle and bustle We are frequent riott travellers and find that Renaissance hotels are usually a step above riott  This hotel was a little disappointing compared to other Rennaisance hotels as about the same as a riott  Still very nice but doesnt compare to visits at other hotels  We liked the location as it was close to everything but still far enough away so that the area was less congested  The hotel bar wasnt very happening so if you are looking to have some cocktails walk across the river and go the Crimson Lounge which is right next to the House of Blues  Overall the experience at this hotel was pleasant but will opt for the riott on Michigan Avenue for our next Chicago trip  
N => last time for me We stayed two nights at the Renaissance last week  We had stayed here several years ago and had security issues at that time  This time on the morning of check out I happened to notice a small corner of a piece of paper that was ths outside in the hall  It was our bill not in an envelope with our name address charges and credit card used all out there for any passer by to see  The room itself was okay though the toilet was rather sluggish  The bathrobe provided looked like it was ready for the rag bag  There were plenty of clean towels provided and the bed was comfortable  Next time well stick to the Swiss or the Talbot  
N => Lovely surprise This hotel was a complete surprise for me   in a great way  Being a Platinum riott Rewards member we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Chicago River looking towards Michigan Blvd  It was magnificent The service was excellent the Club Lounge was well staff and well stocked  I would return here in a heartbeat Hard to beat the central location too 
N => Dont Stay at this Hotel What a disaster Avoid this hotel  Its supposed to be one of the best in Chicago but Im proof that this place is not all that its cracked up to be  We ended up cancelling our reservation and having to move to the Omni Hotel on Michigan Ave  Thank goodness because the service at the Renaissance was a joke  We arrived after check in time only to find out that our room was not available  We spent   hours in the lobby while my husband tried to get some answers from the front desk  He even spoke to the manager  No one seemed to care that I was spending my th birthday in their lobby and missed our dinner reservation  The lobby is gorgeous but the people are rude and very difficult to work with  We just wanted a room with  queen beds which we reserved   but it was not going to happen even though we were told that our room was being cleaned   for   hours  RIGHT Our family strongly recommends that you look past this hotel   its not worth the stress  You would be treated better at a Super  
N => Great experience small room I was here for a conference  The hotel was great as was the food in the different venues we used in the hotel over the week  
N => Mostly a great hotel For the most part this was a very good hotel  Some of the minuses are common to all hotels  For instance the make up mirror would have been perfect for most males or a tall female but not for a short or average height female like myself and my roommate  Although there were two of us staying in the room there was only one bathrobe provided  The first two days the maid only provided towels for one person  We did not have to request extra towels because I showered after swimming in the pool  The pool was swimmable but small  These unfortunately seem to be common to all hotels Other negatives are not common to all hotels  The bathroom door would not stay open by itself we propped it open with my backpack so that we could use the mirror on the door  I needed to plug the phone cord in my laptop so that I could dial up my office network but the phone cord on the desk phone was cht in a cable holder that would not allow me to pull it up onto the desk  The phone cord for the bedside phone was more flexible but there was not an empty electrical outlet to plug the laptop into this limited the length of time I could work to the battery life  The inflexible desk phone cord also meant that you could not move the phone around the desk  I would have loved to watch TV and work at the desk since there was a very good selection of channels you cannot see the TV when sitting at the desk There was a great CDradioalarm clock but there were only instructions for setting the time  We were able to figure out how to set the alarm but a colleague was not able to figure out how to switch to radio from CD Although we were in a room with two double beds there were only two very very small drawers  This would barely meet the needs of one person in the room but was totally inadequate for two  They did provide us with extra hangers based on my request in my riot Rewards profile  Unlike many hotel rooms with two beds there was plenty of open floor space  We were in an upgraded room at not extra charge  This meant that we faced the river which was a very nice view  Otherwise there were no differences in our room compared to colleagues in non upgraded rooms  The beds were comfortable and bathroom was roomy and attractive  
N => Expected Better I just got back from a four night stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel  Before my trip I read all the reviews and was excited to stay here but after my trip I dont know if I would necessarily stay here again  The room The room in general was really nice  It was spacious well appointed and very clean  We had a view of the construction site next door but that was expected since we are associates of the company  The bathroom was great  It was nicely orated and a ent size  What we didnt like however was the temperature in the room  The room was at a constant  degrees all four nights of our stay  On the second night we called the engineer to come take a look at it  He told us that the hotel was having problems with the heatingcooling system and that unfortunately there was nothing he could do  He offered to comp us a movie however that did not make up for the fact that it was ridiculously hot  His only suggestion was to open the windows which we did but being in downtown Chicago all we heard all night long were sirens car horns and the sound of the train  Needless to say we were unable to sleep well at all  The pool I was hoping for something nicer  The atmosphere was very tranquil and sirene which was relaxing however the temperature of the pool and hot tub were not regulated properly  The pool was pretty cold each night we were there and down right freezing our last night mind you this is supposed to be a heated indoor pool and the hot tub was so hot it burned your skin  Now I understand that it is supposed to be hot but this was definitely hotter than the regulation  degrees  The pool water was pretty murky and the one day it wasnt you could see obvious dirt on the bottom  Also the pool closes at pm which is kind of disappointing  Guest Services The staff of the hotel was under par in my opinion  We had a very nice gentleman check us in and give us some details about the area however he did not explain any of the amenites of the hotel  Is there a business center Which floor is the pool on Where is the restaurant located These are little things but it should be explained at check in  The concierge is helpful if you go downstairs to speak with them directly dont try to call them from your room because the phone will ring  times and when they do pick up the will say quotall lines are busy can we call you backquot At check out we ran into a few problems  The desk clerk never bothered to ask us how our stay was to which we would have told him we didnt get any sleep but I guess hes not too worried about that  He did find it difficult however to charge two arate credit cards  I wanted the room and tax on one card and the incidentals on another  He was unsure of how to do this which was fine and asked another associate for help  She helped him out and said everything was all set  When I finally got home I noticed that the clerk charged the same card for both charges so I called up the hotel and asked them to fix it  The woman at the front desk said she took care of it however now the other card was charged both charges  Honestly it is not that hard to split the charges between two credit cards and I wont call back to have it fixed a third time but its not worth it  The restaurant The restaurant food was great  I loved my fish entree  However our server was a little off  He poured my boyfriends beer foam over flowing and just walked away from our table Left the soppy mess right there and didnt look back  Overall our stay was ok however I think Id chose another hotel if Im ever in Chcicago again  
N => Perefectly comfortable I stayed three nights at the Renaissance during the hectic  Modern Language Association convention  Unlike many of the other convention hotels this one turned out to be pretty easy to use  The elevators worked efficiently the buffet breakfast was excellent the staff were efficient and the bedroom was capacious and comfortable  All in all this was an enjoyable experience and Id be strongly inclined to stay there again  
N => Excellent Service Great Location I switched my reservation to this hotel from the Hyatt Regency whose reviews were taking a dive just before my trip  I paid  more for the Renaissance but it was money well spent The service is very good  Check in was swift and pleasant and when the wired Internet connection didnt work the outsourced helpdesk had an engineer at my door within  minutes even though they had talked me through connecting to the wireless service in the meantime  The hotel actually wiped all Internet charges from my bill for my entire three night stay even though I could later connect   thats really going the extra customer service mileThe service in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner could have been quicker at times but the menu is good    be on the more unusual side but thats better than offering predictable fayre The rooms are comfortable  The heating system was efficient and maintained a very good room temperature  The bathroom mirror was nicely lit and there is a nightlight feature mounted under the sink unit flick the light switch down to activate this  Water pressure was above average but not the most powerful Ive experienced but the water was always very hot  One of those good curved shower rails too to give more space when showering  
N => Okay but not worth the money Stayed at the Renaissance the first few days of ember  My wife and I combined a business trip with a weekend getaway  Upon check in I was told my room was not available yet but for  more they had one available now  I lined and they were able to locate my original room reservation  The hotel is okay and did have a few nice touches although for over  a night with tax I have stayed at nicer Chicago hotels  The room was adequate and clean but in need of an update  I felt like we were staying in a s hotel  We ate breakfast in the hotel   food was good but service was slow  The nice touch was the hot chocolate and cookies being served one afternoon when the snow storm hit   Our plane was delayed due to the storm on check out and we were not allowed a later check out  All in all the hotel is okay but I will probably stay elsewhere in the future  
N => Beware of Overbooking When I reserve a hotel room for over  a night I expect there to be a hotel room  This was not the case when my dhter and I arrived at the Renaissance  At  PM in the afternoon after a delayed American Airlines flight we were informed by the assistant manager that there was no room at the inn  They had overbooked  rooms because of a Radiologist Society of North America convention  They offered a comped and upgraded room at the riott Chicago Downtown which was not where we wanted to be so we asked them to find something else  All of the other good hotels were booked so they drove us to the downtown hotel for one night  It was nice but not what we wanted so the next morning they drove us back to the Renaissance where they upgraded our room and gave us two comped meals breakfast and dinner  The comps and upgrades made the ordeal more acceptable After that we enjoyed the hotel and their amenities  The bar and restaurant were all very nice and the food was very good to excellent  The fitness rooms were also very nice  We never got to the pool but Im guessing that it met the hotel standards that I would expect from this establishment  We walked instead of taking the usual taxi  The location was very good when it comes to shopping and some theaters  I would definitely stay here again but I think I would call the day before my flight and the day of my flight to confirm and make my previous experience known to the front desk Be sure to go to Second City for comedy and see the quotJersey Boysquot and quotWickedquot when you visit  The art museums are something people should see as well  They were all great 
N => Find something better  We stayed in Chicago for a long weekend get away and found a  rate that was fair for the great location  Although the room I booked on line came back as not available on my confirmation   even though they still took my money and I still had a reservation   when I called they promised me it would be okay  True to their word it WAS and check in was very smooth having used their advance on line feature they had e mailed me  The room size was nice with good amenities but no safe in the room   The whole room had a wierd problem with screws that were missing or very loose hall door handle tv cabinet closet etc  The bathroom was roomy and clean with nice features   After we cleared up the  they charged me for the mini bar we had not used we had a good stay at a fair price in a very convenient location on the river near Michigan Ave  and Millenium Park and close enough to the Navy Pier  
N => Variably priced views You  want to bargain over the supplement for a room with a full river view  On checking in I was told that the supplement would be  per night  I lined but returned to the front desk on discovering that my assigned room with only a partial river view was next to the elevator  A different person at the front desk then offered me a room with a full river view for an extra   That was reduced to  after I said that her colleague had quoted that amount  My first night turned out unpleasant because the air conditioner was extremely noisy  My subsequent nights were much better although the air conditioner did not respond much to adjusting the thermostat below  degrees  The bed was just OK by my fussy standards  On the plus side the room was quiet and generally nice the view excellent and the staff had a good attitude  I would be willing to stay there again but I would also be interested in exploring the alternatives  
N => Pool was closed We stayed at this hotel Saturday night only and chose this because of the location and the indoor pool  My son and I went to the pool to swim shortly after we checked in and the pool itself was closed however the hot tub and steam room were open  Unfortunatly the pool was closed because it needed to be cleaned so we were disappointed  We initally were told it would be open on Sunday  The hotel told us we could use the pool three blocks away at the Courtyard which was ok at best  On Sunday the pool was still closed as was the hot tub and steam room  Very dissapointing to a ten year old boy whose highlight is to swim at a nice hotel in the big city  The room was very nice a huge bathroom  We stayed on the twenty fourth floor which was quiet  The room faced State street which was ok  A lot of nice shops attached to the lower level of the hotel however they were closed  The club lounge on the twenty seventh floor wasnt open on weekends which was somewhat dissapointing  We didnt eat at the restaruant nor did we go in the lounge  Hotel lobby was very busy Sunday morning  Parking is EXPENSIVE   The hotel employees seemed very nice  Not the nicest hotel weve stayed at but by far not the worst  The pool being closed really was the let down for this hotel  
N => Great Location My husband and I stayed the weekend of ruary   for our anniversary  Overall it is a nice hotel and I would stay there again  We used our riott points to stay for free which is always an added benefit  free rooms are goodWe were able to check in without waiting  I requested a river view room which they gave us  Im sure its prettier in the summer when the river isnt frozen but the lights from the buildings acrossed the river were beautiful at night When we were trying to ide what to do and had the television on it suddenly went off without warning and did not come back on  I contacted the front desk and was told they would send maintenance right up  After an hour I called them again because no one had come  Then after we had drinks in the lounge and the tv still wasnt fixed I requested a new room because I did not want to find out late at night that the tv couldnt be fixed and have no other rooms available  They switched our room without a problem  We actually got the same room location but  floors up The water pressure in the shower was absolutely awful    the worst of any hotel ive ever stayed at  I do not know if other rooms are this way or something was wrong with our shower but it was pathetic The exercise room was wonderful for a hotel  Numerous tredmills and ellipticals plus i believe stair stepper and bikes  There were also strength training machines amp free weights  The only thing I did not like is that the room was very hot perhaps because its attached to the poolspa area and there were no fans going so everyone was really sweating more than was necessary We used the hottub pool and steam room  The latter was wonderful given that you dont see those too often anymore We also had drinks in the lounge which were fine but the lounge itself was nothing to write home about  We did not eat at the hotel I was disappointed to find that there was not a refrigerator for use in the room  The bar was fully stocked but that meant no room for any in room munchies drinks amp such We were also very disappointed in the one time we tried to use the Concierge  Perhaps on the weekend they have less experienced personnel  That is the first time at a riott I have felt that way though As I said i would definitely stay here again  The hotel was nice amp above average and the location great  You could walk to most places  riott rates this hotel as a  on their scale of hotels but I would disagree and say its more like a   The fine points just arent there in my opinion  
N => Excellent Service at the Renaissance Our first visit to Chicago was made even more enjoyable by the service we received at the Renaissance  A few days before our scheduled arrival I called the hotel to check the possibility of getting a river view as opposed to a city view  I was told there would be no problem with that by a very friendly gentleman at the front desk  Upon arrival there was an equally friendly young woman who checked us in  We had arrived a little early so our room wasnt quite ready but she took our cell   and said she would call as soon as it was ready  We received her call within an hour and were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite at no extra charge  A very nice surprise and a beautiful room with a gorgeous view  Every employee we ran into in this hotel from the concierge the bellman the waitress at breakfast the waiter in the lounge the housekeeping staff were all polite amp friendly amp helpful  Our room was immaculate as were all of the public areas of the hotel  The location is also very convenient  We would like to visit Chicago again and would definitely stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel again  
N => Indifferent Inept Staff  Sly cunning extra charges  Avoid This was my third stay at this hotel  My first stay was several years ago and it was a pretty good hotel and a pretty good stay  not great but there were no problems  My second stay was last year and it was frht with problems from there being no room service menu no one answering the front desk concierge or room service phone i had to go downstairs to the front desk to order room service to repeated requests to replace a light in the bathroom it was not replaced during my stay  I expressed my complete dissatisfaction to the management during my stay and upon leaving I thought id give them another try  What a mistake  From a completely inept front desk check in person it took  minutes to check in and Im a  year riott Platinum member to room service order getting lost took over two hours to get it finally delivered to again no answers to calls to the front desk or concierge desk what is the problem here there were problems  Calls to management were met with apologies but no solutions They have two types of coffee in the room  the typical riott brand and Starbucks  If you use the Starbucks you get charged   per pack  To their credit there is a note attesting to this charge but I never read those notes as i never buy the extras  This is the first riott property where there is a charge for ANY of the coffee items on display at the coffee maker I guess ill go back to the Courtyards downtown  i thought the Renaissance and the riott equally awful were more upscale but the Courtyards downtown have both the Renaissance and riott downtown beat by a mile Avoid the Renaissance  They dont care  
N => Expected Better My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel at the end of e  We stayed two nights and used our riott Rewards points for both We had been looking forward to our stay as we booked six months in advance  When we arrived at pm we were greeted with pop music playing in the lobby Quite out of place in such an elegant hotel  We thought classical music or piano would have been a better and more logical choice  We checked in and were given a room on the th floor  Never having been to this hotel we asked about the location of the room and if we were going to be put on the Club floor which is where riott puts Silver Rewards members and we were told rather abruptly that the hotel was sold out and that was the only room availableSo here we go to the th floor      the room was nice not overly big but the bathroom was good size and everything was nice and clean  No complaints there as the housekeeping staff really did a great job with the cleaning  There was however a room service tray outside our door from the previous guests night before meal We called to have someone come and remove it  Then we looked out of the window and saw the L Train fly by and then another and then another      oh boy  Directly below usWe went out to dinner and to a concert iding that if there were no other rooms available wed make the most of it  We came back at about pm and after a brief discussion ided to call and speak to the manager  We explained our situation and told him we thought riott could at least give us breakfast since they didnt give us a particularly good room  He said they couldnt give us breakfast but offered us quotmilk and cookiesquot  What Then he said oh I can move you we do have better rooms       What Thats not what we were told when we checked in  My husband was in the shower by this time and we were pretty much settled in the room for our  nights stay  He offered cheese and crackers     we lined he offered us  off a massge  We lined  He then called back and gave us a  credit for the hotel restaurant  What a carry on We asked him to please removed the tray that was still sitting outside our doorThe following night we got turndown service with one chocolate and the next morning a bill under the door that had a charge for a Starbucks coffee packet  that we didnt even use If the maid had looked we used the free packet and the other was still thereWell that prompted us to speak to the day manager before we had breakfast  She was wonderful and went the extra mile and refunded our points She said we should not have been given that room and gave us her business card and said to call her prior to our next stay  We blame the person at check in for being so awkward  In the future we will ask to see a manager at check in to avoid the carry on we had  It effected our stay in Chicago to a degree but everything else about the city was great I hope when we come back to this hotel they have appropriate music playing in the lobby  it sounded as if they had teenagers at the contols After all when you think about it doesnt the type of music youre hearing set the mood One more thing about the Renaissance Hotel they charge far FAR too much for parking  per night is outrageous  
N => Could have been better We stayed at this hotel for only  nights ch  and il   When we arrived we were told our club room would be ready in quotless than an hourquot  Since it was our first time to Chicago we ided to go to the Sears building  We came back  hours later and our room was still not ready  We were asked if we wanted a regular room with a nice view of the river  Since we did not want to wait anymore we ided to take it  The room was nice great view of the river spacious bathroom and a small refrigerator  We hung up all of our clothes and realized that the room stunk of cigarette smoke  Since this was supposed to be a NON smoking room we called maid service and she came up and sprayed a freshener on the carpets  Also a maintenance guy came up with a machine that was suppose to absord smoke but it didnt help  Also that night we noticed that the room was quite stuffy and warm  The thermostat read  degrees  I usually like it a little cooler when I go to sleep  We tried to lower the temperature and it would not work  We called the front desk and told them that our thermostat was broken  She replied quotwe didnt put our air on yet its not the seasonquot  I pay  a night for a hotel room and I am not allowed to adjust the temperature to what I would like it We told her that we would like it cooler and feel uncomfortable sleeping in a hot room  This is not a Holiday Inn or a Motel  this is a riott She said that maintenance can overide it and it should be okay  Within a couple of hours it was cooler  The next day again the room stunk of smoke  Again we had to call maid service and complain  The carpets stunk the blankets the pillows the sheets  At this point I wasnt sure whether the bedding was ever changed from the previous guest or the maid was smoking as she was cleaning the room  My pajamas stunk of smoke  Its really disgusting if youre not a smoker  And once again the room was hot  We had to call down again and ask them to overide the thermostat  They never did  Ive stayed in many riotts over the years and never had to deal with cigarette smoke and no air  For  a night I should not have to deal with these problems  Aside from that the hotel was quiet at night and only a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile  I am not sure if I would stay here again  They are not very accomodating and they should be more cognizant of smokers in a non smoking room  
N => Rooms were small Staff was horrible We travel to Chicago regulary with our friends from Cleveland and this was our first experience at with this Renaissance Hotel weve stayed at several other Renaissance hotels in the US  Upon checking in the staff did not have my room ready which was OK but by the time we got our room it was extremly tiny we paid  on top of our room rate to get a larger room  We called front desk and they moved us in to another room which had water all over the floor  We asked for another room and they had one so this our rd move the room smelled like smoke  We were so tired we took the room because we didnt want to be extreme pains  We went out to dinner everything is far away from this hotel and had to take cabs all night long  The only thing close to this hotel is bowling across the river  I was not impressed  We finally checked out  nights later and will not go back to this hotel again  Id rather go to another hotel north of the river  
N => OK  but nothing great My wife and I thought the hotel was adequate but nothing great  The hotel was clean and the rooms were nice but for the money I didnt see anything special  The little things just werent there at least not in our case  My wife wanted to take a bath so I called down trying to find some bubble bath and was offered no help whatsoever  I also thought the entrance to the hotel was very poorly designed  You have to walk in where the car drop off is so there are cars all over the place making it very awkward to enter and exit the building by foot  I was also disappointed that fresh towels were not provided later in the evening after cleaning up to go out  We had to use wet towels in the morning  I know these are little things but when you are paying good money for a room i think you deserve more than this hotel provided  
N => Very nice I stayed at this hotel in     We took the quotLquot to the hotel from Midway airport  It was so easy to find we just went down the stairs from the quotLquot and there was the hotel and protesters outside the hotel for some reason  Anyway the lobby was very nice and big very elegant  Check in was a breeze however we requested  double beds and she said they didnt have anything available  She then said they had a King room wa sofa bed  So we took that  Glad we did because it was on the corner of a high floor and the room was about double the size of a regular room  It was very nice however it could use a little updating The location was very good but since it was next to the quotLquot you could hear it all night until it stopped  It was a short walk to the Magnificant Mile shops and State Street shops were even closer  Next time Id like to stay on the mile because it seems thats where we spent most of our time  
N => Excellent hotel Hope to stay here again Location puts all major Chicago attractions within walking distance or a short cab drive  Hotel amenities and service rates a   out of  stars  Even though our room was booked through Priceline we still received top notch service  
N => General comments  
N => Anniversary stay from hell  
N => first rate property  
N => The hotel was okay but not as amazing as I had hoped it would be Pros The room was very clean and had great Aveda shampoosoap a plus since I had forgotten my own stuff  The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of channels  The hotel itself was a great value giving us an affordable place to stay during the Chicago athon  The room service was very prompt and the food was pretty good  I particularly enjoyed their fries  They had a nice pool and hot tub as well with towels on the way there  The breakfast was pretty standard hotel breakfast with a made to order omelette station I didnt get to try this because they mixed up my omelette no meat with someone elses lots of ham and bacon  But it looked good   just keep an eye on your food  Cons When we got into our room one of the shades in the quotliving roomquot was broken and the door deadlock would occasionally get stuck in the locked position  We never asked the staff to fix these problems so it  be unfair to complain about it  There was ALWAYS a wait at the front desk no matter what time of day I went down there  I really felt like the hotel was understaffed but be that was because it was a busy weekend  We asked for more towels in the morning and told them they could take their time as we didnt need them until the afternoon  We didnt realize that this would result in an  hour delay after which we called for towels again  They were promptly sent up at that point  The concierge lounge was nice and quiet but didnt have public computers or printers for use Upon check out I was a little upset because when we asked the woman at the desk to hold our bags for the day we could have asked for late checkout but thought this would be more convenient for the hotel she crammed my athon poster into our bag then wheeled it into a wall and bent it in half  I was shocked at the lack of care for personal belongings so Id recommend you not utilize this service  
N => Very Nice  Airport Hotel  We needed a hotel near the Airport  The Renaissance was Great Their shuttles had longer hours of opperation than other hotels  that we neededThe room was nice  and the staff was friendly  
N => Very Nice Very beautiful hotel I took a trip to Joliet to visit my boyfriend who played football at a college there  On the night that I was scheduled to fly back to Louisiana there was a huge snow storm amp fortunately I was placed in this hotel  What a treat Very clean well kept and classy place  My room overlooked the expressway  There is also a Bennigans restaurant in walking distace amp the shuttle to the airport was a PLUS  
N => Wonderful Surprise We had stayed downtown during the week for a convention  We had booked the Renaissance OHare due to an extremely early return flight and wanted to be closer to the airport  We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived  The hotel was literally a couple of minutes from the train and had complimentary shuttles to the airport the next morning  The rooms were clean and fresh smelling    the bathroom was immaculate  Things that couldnt be said about the more expensive  star hotel we had spent the week in downtown  I told my husband I would have rather stayed at the Renaissance and taking the train in everyday The next time we go to Chicago we will definitely keep the Renaissance in mind 
N => Yet another happy Park  A great rate from ParkSleepFly com was too good to pass up Suite accomodations slept my wife amp I in the king bed and our two boys  amp  on the sofa sleeper  Front desk informs you that you can call Housekeeping to make up the sofa sleeper which they did within a few minutes notice Nice large bathroom had large walk in shower but a very high countertop means you have to wheel the desk chair in so the kids can reach the sink to brush teeth  Hard surfaces in the bathroom also meant that sounds echoed so even though the bath can be closed off from the bedroom and sitting areas it can be loud when youre trying to get the kids asleep for an early wakeup Limited services available after pm   Starbucks was closed  We went out to dinner then early to bed for a am wakeup eek  Airport shuttle runs on the half hours all night long if you need it Indoor parking cant be beat but spaces are tight and people park however they darn well please  The only glitch was my parking ticket didnt work in the exit gate upon returning from our trip after being authorized for the week of parking before we left  Fortunately no one was behind me at the automated gate as I had to back up and re park then go back to the front desk and wait behind other customers while my family was waiting anxiously in the lobby  The front desk eventually gave me a new ticket which allowed me to exit the garage successfullyWell definitely return for future Park amp Flys from ORD  Even if youre not flying out check those rates because normal hotel parking is  per day and it might be cheaper than what youre quoted elsewhere for this property  
N => Easy Park and Fly We stayed here the night before an AM from OHare  The highway access is super easy and the shuttle got us to OHare quickly  Our room was on the tenth floor facing the highway so we had a little noise but nothing too bad  We got in late so we didnt visit the restaurant or bar but they looked ent enough  Youre just steps from the Cumberland stop on the Blue Line so there are lots more options easily available  The room was a full suite which I hadnt expected so there was plenty of room to move around  I would consider this as a base for a long term visit to the city at least when the Blue Line weekend work is done  Not a luxury hotel but very comfortable We booked a ridiculously cheap rate through Park Sleep Fly which included up to  weeks of covered parking and the total was less than if wed used the OHare remote lot  Wed definitely stay here again  
N => They Ripped me off with unauthorized charges on my credit card The hotel is nice enough  But beware they will hit your credit card with charges you will know little to nothing about until you get your credit card bill We were at a function downtown and pre paid for a room at this hotel  The hotel is nice as was the room  However if you drive there and expect to park your car there please think twice When we arrived it was raining the valet service had cars parked in every conceivable spot include more than a dozen cars with only two wheels still on the pavement and the rest of the car up over the curb  As a result we were greated near the street by the value and handed our claim ticket  We walked into the front entrance and directly to the front desk to check in No where did we see a sign advising of the parking charge for guests that park there  There is a sign but it is way over on the side of the building next to the garage exit   not someplace we came anywhere close to  We were not informed by any staff of any charges for parking  I know some hotels do charge their guests for parking but others do not We stayed the night and when we left I checked out at the front desk and they said everything was taken care of  So I dropped off the room keys and went to get our car  We were not offered nor given a receipt  I assumed there was no need since there was no reason to have additional charges other than what I already paid for when I booked the room Handing the car claim ticket to the valet service we then waited for the car to be brought out  And waited and waited   we waited over  minutes  Again the drive was completely packed with parked cars they had yet to relocate into the parking garage  So when our car finally came out they had only one place they could put it and that was out near the street again   at least this time it was not raining Having to check my credit card account for other reasons today I noticed several charges from the hotel  One was   and the other was    So I called they had no idea what those charges were for   supposedly my card was to be charged  for parking and   for a bottle of water from the mini bar that we never even opened Parking in downtown Chicago on a weekend for any overnight rarely costs more than  at any parking garage  Thus this charge which they neither got my consent for nor did they inform me of it at any time while at the hotel is very excessive After speaking with a manager at the hotel they agreed to remove the mini bar charge but refused to remove the parking charge I have a great deal of problem with any business that takes free license to charge your credit cards without first informing you of those charges and obtaining your consent for those charges  Because they seem to be able to do this and have no problem doing it I would strongly advise that you avoid this hotel  
N => NO CONCIERGE AVAILABLE I really wanted to like this hotel but the fact that they didnt have a concierge available especially first time in Chicago Concierge leaves at am  and you have to be an Elite member to get access to the concierge lounge  
N => Great stay and fly hotel This hotel is located  minutes from OHare  The parking for our car was a covered structure which was better than other hotels  They have  hour service to the airport  The hotel suite was roomy  It was clean  The bed was comfortable  The staff was VERY courteous  The van driver was quite helpful particularly since my husband is handicapped  
N => ent Room nice hotel overall but does not appear to have riott Revive Bedding This hotel is fairly nice  The front desk staff was very friendly and the room was very clean  My only complaint was the bedding  Most riott hotels have upgraded to the riott Revive bedding but this hotel does not appear to have done so  The bed was very firm and not as comfortable as Im accustomed to at most riottRenaissance hotels  It also does not yet have flat screenhdtv  While this hotel was nice I gave it an average rating in comparison to most other riotts  
N => great value We booked this through a ParkSleepFly leaving our car their for a week  It was easy to get to from I  covered parking and a really nice room  Clean and spacious  It was well worth the money  We were able to use the pool and it was warm and clean  Staff was very helpful and the shuttle was quick and easy to the airport  No problems at all  We will stay here again  
N => excellent hotel Excellent hotel Great rooms clean restaurant Starbucks in lobby Close to OHare gas stations to fill rentals near by Excellent staff Parking not included  
N => What a Find This is one of the nicest hotels near OHare   And Ive stayed at most of them United Airlines put me up here for a night after a recent cancellation   They usually get me the Hilton but they were booked  I have very little bad to say about this place First of all the room was quite spacious  a little larger than most all suite properties  The or was very new and fresh  The parlor room had a flat panel TV while the bedroom had a standard tube TV  The bathroom was very large and blesque  I joked with my wife about the shower  I came out and said quotWhew that was close  I almost got lost in therequot The shower was that big  A few minor gripes with the room the blinds  they were very tough to close  Also while the bed was super comfy the pillows were pretty weak  But my biggest gripe was the bed was a queen  not sure if they have Kings or not   We sleep on a king at home so to us it seemed cramped  This was a club level room  I have low level elite status with riott so not sure if the standard rooms are any different  The restauant was amazing It was a Saturday night shortly before closing  only people in there  Service was great but the food   I had their signature pasta dish which was to die for  Next time United strands me at OHare Ill request this hotel over the Hilton even though its about  minutes further from ORD  
N => Superb Excellent from start to finish  Beds were just wonderful  
N => Great place to stay park and fly We recently stayed at the hotel for one night in order to park and fly out of OHare  The hotel far exceeded our expectations  The room was nice and clean  The shuttle was waiting right outside the door and we were able to leave our car for  days  The price could not be beat I recommend this hotel the next time you are flying out of OHare  
N => Love to stay here After two night in hotel downtown we moved to stay here for the last night and I loved it here  Nice design hotel newfriendly staffbig roomclean and easy to get to the airport  If I go to Chicago agian I will stay here 
N => They dont quite get it yet at the Renaissance With all the Hawkeye amp Cub fans in town for Labor Day games rooms in the Loop were hard to find for the weekend of our dhter s college move in  So we went out to Rosement just a few minutes up I from downtown  My hubby checked in Friday while I arrived on Saturday at Pm  Its a good thing we had another room because the second room was not ready until well after PM  This is my pet peeve    waiting for my room And from a riott Shame shame To the defense of the reception staff they were embarrassed  I just told them to relax because I was going to dinner and would use the other room for now  And they did try to get the two rooms near one another    just around the corner The hotel is large and well placed off the interstate only blocks from the quotL quot Its not far from a great forest preserve that we used for our morning walkrun  We came back for breakfast    not include    and very expensive for what you get on the buffet The staff was very pleasant this morning with a quick quotgood morningquot and quothave a good day quot And there wasnt anything really bad but I just didnt get a good feeling about the hotel  Our second room smelled soooo bad  The blinds were hanging off  Our shower head was a hair away from exploding  Still the room was clean  The baths were ble  The price was right   What was my problem Perhaps it was the design  I am not really into that European orange and beige  The living room was small as was the bedroom  But thats not usually enough for me to complain on my Trip Advisor Forum  Now that I think about it I think it was just the little things  It felt like cheap luxury    upscale wanna be  I dont think I would stay here again but for a family looking for value it worked  Just don t sweat the small stuff  
N => Great weekend away at the Renaissance My mom my son  year old and I stayed here back in y of   I had to write this even if a little late because it was a wonderful weekend Our room was like a mini suite with the bedroom arate from the living area T V  area  This is especially nice when traveling with a small child We were able to explore downtown Chicago come back to the hotel and rest and wake up feeling well rested We had the opportunity to use room service twice over the weekend  I have to say that even though it is expensive to do this the food was really great and worth it The beds were comfy and the bathroom was huge For just over  per night I would definitely stay here again 
N => Perfection My husband surprised me with a trip to Chicago and we stayed at the Renaissance  What a treat Amazing room it was like a mini suite with erate sleeping area off from the sitting area  It had two tvs which for me was a big deal the most comfortable bed ever prompt service lovely people gorgeous bathroom  Really one of the best hotels ive stayed at  We had a rental car but it looks like the metro would be an easy way to get to downtown Chicago  The only thing was we had a bit of a hard time finding the place at first  Its in one of those locations where you can see the hotel but have to figure out how to get to it  We called the hotel  times and they sort of walked us through finding them  Once we were there it was easy to get to   otherwise   fantastic hotel 
N => Some good points and some annoyances I chose the hotel due to its proximity to the office where I would be working during my time in Chicago  Overall the hotel is clean and the staff were competent at most times  The rooms are clean spacious and well designed  I noticed some sloppy construction and finishing work in the room The hotels restaurant in which I only had breakfast served lukewarm coffee on the first morning  It was quickly replaced with hot coffee but the food was so so  I also found the restaurant to be rather dimly lit and hard to read the newspaper  I recommend the tables near the windows although they were cold and drafty on a cold uary morning The biggest annoyance was the parking lot and the validated tickets that never seemed to work  Several times I tried to use the ticket only to have to re park my car and return to the front desk All in all a good stay but nothing spectacular  In comparison to other hotels in the area it is about average  
N => When do I get my rooms Booked a one night stay directly with the hotel for connecting rooms  They said only  queen rooms connect so I booked two connecting queen rooms  When I arrived I was informed my rooms were not connecting as no  queen rooms connect They got me a king and  queen room connecting over the river but    I didnt get the second room until  Hey check in is  Very nice rooms very nice hotel  But late check in pretty much ruined my stay  Man who do I have to call to make sure my reservation is going to be honored if not the hotel directly When I complained I got a whopping   off one room If your time is only worth   for one and a half hours then this is your hotel  Sorry I cant recommend   
N => Nice Hotel but    This was a nice airport hotel but I have no reason to choose it again when in the area  This is a newer hotel with really nice rooms however the sound proofing is rather poor considering its proximity to the Kennedy expressway L train and airport  I could hear every L train as it passed by the hotel and the air traffic noise got a bit loud at times  In my opinion this was not up to regular Renaissance standards which are usually nicer than the anchor riott line  The room was ent sized however failed to include a microwave or a fridge  The bedroom was rather small with very little room at all once the door was closed  For the cost  a night this was a great hotel but once again not up to Renaissance par  If you can spare the extra  stay at the riott Suites Ohare up the road which has much larger rooms and much better sound proofing  
N => Great Airport Hotel  Bad Shuttle  
N => Good business hotel   
N => Looks good on paper   not so much in person  A friend and I stayed here for a long weekend vacation  Before we came we did a lot of looking online at the hotel  However when we got to the hotel things just seemed to different from the lobby to even the exterior  The room was just ok but the maid service was great  We got new towels and different amenities everyday along with a fresh bed change  The elevators were extremely slow and the front desk was just semi helpful  The free breakfast was definitely quotfreequot  Overall this hotel was just fine for what we needed because we mostly just slept there  It is in an awesome location with the Magnificent Mile just a few blocks away  For a booking rate of  night this was a ent place to stay  
N => Awesome Stay and Great Trip We used priceline to book hotel and flight for  roundtrip for  for  nights  Such a nice deal and well definitely do again next Easter weekend The only negative is that there are no stairs leading to the first floor  Lots of people complained about the breakfast area not being big enough but the breakfast had everything and people ate and left fast  Just dont wait until the last hour to eat breakfast   go a little earlier if you dont like to wait  We really cant complain since we liked everything about this location   convenient to shopping and we took the cab everywhere in order to save time  There are  slow elevators but the longest we waited was  minutes Our room was nice and having a fridge and microwave was great since we always had leftovers  Our bed was a king and it was comfy  There is no tub but the shower was roomy  No view in our room but we were always out and we liked it dark for sleeping which was the only thing we did since we had too much fun exploring the town  Were huge Foodies so it was close to lots of good food  Wear comfortable shes and walk to get Hot Chocolate at Hersheys  Tapas Zodiac Restaurant inside Neiman cus   we love their huge popovers wstrawberry butter and Food Life attached to Macys  Plasma TV was a plus which the Hubby lovedI guess our room was a studio since the bed was not in a arate room but it was much more roomy than the last hotel room we stayed at in New York City  Did I mention   we loved having free internet access from our room Cant wait to come back 
N => First Class service and A accomodations There is not one negative thing to say about this lovely Michigan Avenue hotel its one block from Water Tower Place  The hotel staff was awesome  We got to the hotel at noon  Check in wasnt until  and they said they would call us on our cell phone as soon as our room was available  I couldnt believe it they actually called an hour later and we were able to check in  Thats a first for us We were on the th floor in a two room suite  The bedroom area alone was larger than most normal hotel rooms  Everything was so clean and well orated  We attended the managers Barbecue buffet for dinner excellent and the next morning the managers breakfast excellant again  We were so pleased with the hotel and staff we tried to make a reservations for another stay in  but unfortuneately they were booked  The hotel is located further to the North on Michigan Avenue but a very nice walk to all the shopping attractions and not to far of a walk to Navy Pier  
N => Tiny Bathroom Residence inn has been our hotel of choice all over the US  We are always pleased with the facilities amp staff  We always save money due to having our own kitchen which is always stocked well enough for breakfast amp small snack  means  Plenty of room amp TVs for our family of   We stayed in a bedroom suite    Only bad thing at this hotel was the tiny bathroom  The toilettub room was  x    and the sink area was also small  We understand that this used to be an apt bldg  which could explain the cramped bath area  If it was not divided up in res  inn style the area would at least have seemed bigger  I would reccomend this room for a couple or fam w teenagers  bathing babies would be impossible  The street below was not busy so it was very quiet not typical for Chicago downtown   We were within walking distance to many very nice restaurants amp   blocks from Mich  ave  The bldg  behind the hotel has a groceryparty store  
N => Enjoyed our repeat stay  Very nice  Like staying in a one bedroom apt  Plenty of room  Only complaint was its not WIFI you have to plug in  Location is great  
N => Generous room but not really a suite I was somewhat disappointed as the Inn is listed as a suite but it is only one large room with a kitchenette a small sofa bed amp a queen bed  My husband amp I sometimes get up in the night and it is nice to be able to read without bothering the other  When this came about I had to sit in the bathroom because it was the only part that had a door that shut off the rest of the suite  Otherwise everthing else was quite up to snuff and it has lower prices right now because they are remodelling one floor at a time  We did hear anything  Breakfast buffet was extensive  
N => In need of reation We regularly stay at Residence inns so were a little suprised at howoutdated our hotel room was  They are clearly in a reation programme   and it needs it  We had a  bedroom suite which was a good size for five people but with only one bathroom it was not ideal Our suite had everything else we have come to expect of Residence Inns   it was just old fashioned  It was clean comfortable and quiet   which are always my most important factors when chosing a hotel  It is in a great location too Given that the rooms are being updated   I would probably stay here again  
N => Okay if You lIke Crowds We have a big family so its always a chore to find a two bedroom suite even if price isnt an issue  Residence Inn offers plenty of room  We had a two bedroom suite but could have used another bathroom since we have two teenage girls  Hot water was also a problem  Our room was located at the end of the hall and it took no less that  minutes with every faucet running to get hot water  The room also smelled bad like hobos had been camping in it for several days The hotel itself was at full capacity since it was a holiday weekend and the elevators were very slow  The breakfast was a big plus except the guests would camp out at big tables and one morning some of us sat at a dirty table while the rest had to stand  It did save us a lot of time and you cant beat the price    free It certainly wasnt a relaxing experience having to elbow your way in to get food and then to try and not trip over small children running amok As far as the location its good if all you want to do is shop  I prefer a more central location near the river  I would recommend this hotel to people with small children but I wont be staying there again  It was far too chaotic  
N => Like having your own apartment Found this hotel because a business associate was staying there  The rate was more than I wanted to spend but another TripAdvisor person had posted a link to TravelZoo with a signifigant discount  a night down to   Thanks TripAdvisor Our room had a queen size bed sofa sleeper and kitchenette with microwave stove fridge dishwasher and dishes  Free hot breakfast and a light supper including free beerwine was included  Was a great opportunity to meet others  Had I realized what a great place this is I wouldnt have been so reluctant to spend the   We will return 
N => Has its pluses Stayed at the Residence Inn Downtown Chicago right before the World Series started this year late ober   The hotel is in a good location especially for shopping Not on an overly crowded street and just   blocks from Hanncock Building Easy to get in and out of but be familiar with surroundings if you have to take a cab  Two of our cab drivers didnt know where the hotel was located when we named it The bell and valet staff were great If you need any information about where things are in the city ask them  I also ran into a woman that worked behind the scenes and she was extremely helpful with kid friendly attractions what to do and how to get to where we were going The free breakfast was nice and had a wide variety of items to choice from of course crowded  Just dont plan to rush through the breakfast bar  The happy hour was really a waste not much to it especially considering the hassle The front desk staff was generally unfriendly or unfamiliar with tourist information  We were traveling with our   year old and were put in a room right next to the elevator    when we asked to be moved we completely inconvienced the front desk woman and she let us know it  When we asked where the Museum of Science and Industry a great musuem they didnt know directions The rooms arent overly huge but nice especially considering you have a kitchen  The bathroom was really really small but clean    actually had to curl my hair in the kitchen infront of the microwave    there was no where to put things in the bathroom other than one small foot long shelf about five inches wide above the sink or on top of the toilet seat  Id run all the dishes through the dishwasher before you use them  Lots of our dishes werent clean  The room was really HOT  You couldnt turn off the heat the only alternative you had was to open up the windows    no screens    not safe with small children  And this is a family hotel  The instructions on the heater actually stated to open windows Two small elevators for the entire hotel    dont plan to go anywhere fast during peak periods    during breakfast check in check out and happy hour  Theres no pool at the hotel you have to go to the riott to swim or exercise and then you have to pay a fee for it  Well try another hotel next time but wont rule this one out  
N => Just a standard downtown hotel My wife and I booked a room for four nights on Thanksgiving weekend and I am not suprised that this hotel has sunken in the TA rankings as of late  The location is fine and rooms are quiet enough but we had a few complaints  The biggest problem is that the windows dont open   not even a crack  The recycled air was very dry and made the room a little stuffy  The cleaning service as mentioned in previous reviews was not great   bed turndown was inconsistent and parts of the room seemed untouched  There was peeling and scratched wallpaper and the caulking around the bathtub was a little moldy and stained  The reception staff was inconsistent as well  The concierge service wasnt the most professional Having said all this I need to say that the rate I recieved from Hotwire was very reasonable  I find it hard to call this hotel substandard because compared with other downtown quotfour starquot establishments in Chicago it was no different  However the higher rates one pays when conventions are in town would have left us disappointed  I dont see any reason to choose this Kimpton over say the Hotel Intercontinental  
N => Good but could be improved Generally really like Kimpton  Have stayed in fabulous one in Portland and another in NYC  Hotel Monoco was OK but has some annoying weaknesses  Pros Great Beds Good linens and robes and towels  Clean rooms and obliging if not always pro active staff  Fabulous location Cons Had to constantly ask for extra towels usually in a Kimpton a record is kept of preferences  Sometimes we got turn down sometimes not  One day even with service sign room was not made up till well after  and then only when I asked at desk  Staff while cooperative was not really into personalized service Room next to ours had put their fish out in hall where it stayed for days while housekeeping staff ignored it  Finally after I complained that fish was neglected it was picked up Worst con is adjacent restaurant  Very mediocre rather standard hotel dfare quite overpriced  Breakfasts all had to be ordered a la carte  Staff always seemed rushed and overwhelmed  Not up to standards of other Kimpton associated restaurants Because of general room comfort cleanliness and location would probably stay there again  
N => Never again Dear TripAdvisor You have put this hotel on your Travelers Choice list but be you should rethink that ision  My husband wanted to surprise me for my th birthday by staying overnight in downtown Chicago  He booked a room for one night Friday ober th and asked for a room on the top floor with the best view  We arrived early  at  a m   and were told the room wouldnt be ready until   They told us we could check in our bag and they would call our cell phone when the room was ready  We paid to check in the bag and left to do sightseeing and shopping  Although no one had called we returned at  and retrieved our bag  The room was still not ready  Now we were told by the manager that the guests had paid to stay in the room until  p m  so it wouldnt be ready until  p m  by the time housekeeping cleaned it  They offered another room on a lower floor without the best view  I asked what the rate would be and was told it was the same  We looked at it  The view was disappointing  Since they were going to charge us the same rate we ided to wait for the better room we had originally been promised  We paid to check in our bag again  We spoke to the concierge for recommendations on where to kill some time until our room was ready  He gave us a card for a free appetizer at the hotels adjoining restaurant Water Street  We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers  a flatbread pizza and  quotslidersquot items the bartender described as the special appetizers of the day  When we presented the coupon with our order she said she could not honor it for the flatbread because that quotis not really an appetizer  Its just what we happen to be serving today quot But she could apply it toward the sliders  each  We told her to call the concierge next door  She spoke to him over the phone out of our earshot  She agreed to honor it for the flatbread but asked if we wanted the special one she had previously described or the one quotwith just the cheese quot I was ready to go back to the hotel and return the quotfreequot appetizer coupon if it was going to be that painful for them to honor it   We were done at the restaurant around   Feeling like we were wasting our day we went out again  At  p m  still no one had called us  We went back to the hotel and asked if our room was ready yet  The girl behind the desk looked confused  Yes it was ready  I asked why no one had called us  She had no answer  During this conversation the manager was present and he also offered no explanation why we had not been called   Once we were finally in the room we felt we should have a late check out to make up for the time we had to wait  I called the desk and spoke with the same girl we had just checked in with  She informed me the latest we would be allowed to check out was  p m  I told her that was not satisfactory since when we tried to check in earlier we were told late check out was at   She put me on hold returned and said we could check out at    Finally in the room and unpacked I attempt to take a shower and no soap I called the desk again  Housekeeping arrived shortly with  bars Im not trying to get extra soap  I dont think one bar of soap is too much to ask  Everything about our stay at Hotel Monaco went wrong and it could have so easily been fixed with an apology or a reduced room rate  There was nothing special about this hotel that would make us return or recommend it  
N => Apathetic Staff Not High Class Service I have a great love for Kipton Inns this one does not even come close to the type of service I expect  Its  I have just returned to my room and it is still not cleaned despite the fact that the service hanger has been sitting on my door all day  I called to the front desk but they said quotthere is no guarantee when they will get to my roomquot Also my minibar was not stocked proper on arrival Only  beers I called the front desk to notify them and the next day the fridge had one beer I went to the front desk about this the next morning and they said quotit would be cheaper to just get supplies across the street quot If I cared about cheaper do you think I would being paying night to stay in this hotel Also their was no room service menu in my room when I called to get one they gave me attitude and argued with me  This place is not worth the money despite the nice or and great views of Chicago  
N => Monaco was great I stayed with my teenage dhter and niece at the Hotel Monaco e  y   I printed out directions we were coming from the Field Museum but after  turn the street was blocked off for Taste of Chicago  So it took us about an hour driving around downtown in Friday rush hour traffic stuck behind a bus but we finally found it  We opted for the valet parking at  dollars a night  It seemed high but when I checked with a nearby parking garage the fee was  dollars for  hours so the extra few dollars was worth the convenience  Check in was painless and our bellman was very pleasant  I thought he was going to unpack our luggage for us The room was huge two queen beds etc but no window seat which was my determining factor for choosing this hotel over its sister hotel the Burnham  I called down to the front desk and the very efficient clerk assured me that I had a really nice room and I should stick with it  If i wanted to switch to a room with the window seats it  not be as large and I  not get two beds  I didnt feel like making a fuss so we stayed with our non view room  As I said it was quite large with  small tables with chairs two comfy armchairs one with an ottoman and the cabinet in the corner with tv honor bar and cd player  The bathroom was especially large also with nice size tub and shower  I was happy to see the magnifying makeup mirror but the bulb must have been burned out  The extras like cotton balls and cotton swabs were provided that was a nice touch  I signed up for the Kimpton customer loyalty program and was pleasantly surprised to receive a tray shortly after we got to our room with a personalized card a bottle of Fiji water and a biscotti as well as a complimentary menu item should we go to the restaurant  The beds were comfortable one had a down comforter one had a blanket  The orative pillows were kind of stained and gross but we always just toss those to the side as soon as we get into the room anyhow so no big deal  We faced out onto an alley and the first night I was awakened by garbage pickup in that alley never heard a peep from other guests though  I didnt take advantage of the wine reception in the evenings or Starbucks in the morning but other people seemed to be enjoying them  We were in the room the first night when the turn down attendent came so she just left ice and candy  The second night we got back late and I was expecting to come back to a dark room  I was pleasantly surprised to come into a dimly lit room with the relaxation channel on the tv and a chocolate surprise on the pillow  We had a problem with the toilet not flushing efficiently and practically before I could hang up the phone an engineer was there plunger in hand and had the problem taken care of  When I returned home I received an online survey to fill out  I dutifully fill those out as I have gotten them at other hotels Ive stayed in  I was honest and to my surprise I got an email back from the manager saying he was sorry my stay wasnt flawless and should I stay there again make my reservations directly with him and he would do everything in his power to make sure I got my  beds plus the window seats  That was refreshing  Ive had major problems at other hotels before and no response back from management  To have this personal reply to my minor disappointment made the difference for me between looking at another hotel among the many fine ones in downtown Chicago or going back to the Monaco  To sum it up the location was great for the theatre  blocks to theatre where Wicked is playing  Garretts popcorn is right next to the theatre shall Fields is right there     Wed planned on going to Water Tower place for shopping but ended up in that same little area of State Street every day  There was plenty to do  So try the Monaco  The staff are so friendly and efficient and their commitment to customer service is exemplary  
N => Sorry   have to disagree on this one I am usually one to agree with the masses and typically agree with fellow raters on TripAdvisor   but I cant agree on this one  I will preface this by saying it is possible that it is just due to the holiday weekend and the hotel being booked full but we will not give it another chance to see Arrival Doorman literally just looked at us coming in with our luggage we had to walk from down the street due to the parade  There was no offer to try and get the door or to even help us with the luggage  I thought that was a litte strange but okay whatever Check in Perky girl at the front starts checking me in and then says quotoh no   what do I doquot Sorry cant help you there The young man next to her tells her our room is not ready and we can preregister  My husband and I were not upset at all that the room was not ready because we were there several hours before check in  However this young man looks at us and tells us quotwe cant just kick them out you knowquot NOW Im getting a little nervous that this is going to be the hotel from    but we lhed and said that we understood and they said they will call us when the room is ready  We left ate walked the entire Mag Mile sat at the Vet Memorial  la di dah   no calls   finally at check in time I ask a less perky girl if the room might be ready  She says quotnoquot  I mean nothing else so I said well do you have an estimate She said no its hard to tell  I could go on but lets just say that we finally were helped by an older gentlemen who was WONDERFUL  He called housekeeping got our room ready and we were in only an HOUR after check in time Room Next time I wont ask about the room and be they will actually clean it  There was a mess left from the previous guests  Wrappers plastic tags and lots of hair in the bathroom  UGH  To think we paid  for a Med Suite and actually had to inspect the sheets to see if they were cleaned  The couch had stains I wont go there and the floor had lots of little puddle stains  I know they are pet friendly but this seemed a little much  The shower was extremely small and you had to do some strange maneuvering with the bathroom door to get to it and the toilet  However we did enjoy their bathroom amenities and their cute minibar offerings  Nice view of the Chicago River State Street and Wabash  Restaurant South Water Kitchen was actually pretty good  We ate twice in the restaurant and once as room service  It was pretty basic fare but it was all very good  Location we liked where the Hotel Monaco is located  It was an easy walk to the Mag Mile theater district pretty much anywhere we wanted to go  The only thing I would suggest is if you are going to Chicago strictly to shop then the location  be out of the way  I cant imagine having a lot of shopping bags and not being able to drop them off occasionally  If shopping is your passion I would suggest staying on Michigan Ave somewhere such as the Intercontinental In sumy I did not hate the Hotel Monaco  I think their front desk personnel needs training in basic customer service skills and their housekeepers at least the ones on the third floor could use some retraining  However it was a whimsical hotel with cute touches and does offer a complimentary wine reception in the evening  
N => Enjoyed my stay at the Monaco I enjoyed my stay at the Monaco mid    for a business trip  I loved the atmosphere of the hotel although unfortunately on a quick business trip I was not able to enjoy many of their amenities the wine reception the goldfish etc I did eat at the hotel and although the food was very good the service was somewhat slow  The area was a short cab ride away to my clients offices but was convenient to get to from Midway airport via CTA train  I think my favorite part was the window seat to enjoy the view from my window  It was a great way to relax and enjoy the city  
N => Underwhelmed Having read the read great reviews here for the Monaco I was expecting more   especially for the high price  The hotel was only OK in my view  Initial impression on arrival was uninspiring  The rooms were OK  The view from the window seat was nice  The restaurant attached be arate management was pretentious over priced and distinctly ordinary  The hotel never real felt close to anywhere and having to wait for the valet parking every time I wanted to go out was a pain  As I had to use the car most of the time anyway when business or pleasure takes me to Chicago I now usually stay out of town and save myself a small fortune  
N => Wonderful What a lovely find We checked in on a Thursday evening and were invited to a warm wine reception with good wine and a friendly sommalier and the concierge helped us make reservations at a four star restaurant  The staff was unpretentious and courteous  Unfortunately our babysitter called to let us know that our son had a fever of   We immediately had to check out but the manager said quotDont worry about the charge quot We never got to stay the night but so appreciated his generosity We will definitely reschedule 
N => wonderful hotel as other reviewers have noted service at his hotel was topsthe room was very nice and comfortable including the bed  shower worked well  Bath products nice  paid  dollars for a room worth more  Location is good Only complaints on check in at a very early hour  am they were kind to find us rooms available at that hourunfortunately they offered us the worst room in the hotel right across from the elevator on the nd floor  this was quickly changed at our request  one morning we ate at the attached restuarant and they forgot us  The food was ent  
N => Anniversary Surprise For our anniversary my wife surprised me with a stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago  We had an awesome time there  The room suite was spacious and the whirlpool tub for  was a nice touch  Both the bedroom and living room were fun and eclectically furnished  We got a lot of use out of the window seats overlooking the river Chicago River in our corner room  The staff was great and the valet guy was the best not to mention he went to U of M Duluth   where we live  We look forward to staying there again  
N => Just OK After staying at the Monaco in Seattle the Chicago Monaco is not as nice    nor the staff as helpful  The concierge was a joke  Recommended mostly all the places you find in the glossy hotel magazine for dining  Room was bizarre in its layout    very difficult bathroom to use as the door barely cleared the tub and sink and the smallest shower I have ever used    including on a cruise ship  This was the Mediterranean Suite  Doesnt hold a candle to the one in Seatte  Will not stay here again  Too many nice hotels to choose from  Great location though  
N => My New Favorite I love all of the Chicago Kimpton Hotels but since my last stay at Hotel Monaco have ided the this is my new favorite  Check in was a breeze I asked about room size and the clerk told me If I wanted a bigger room with no view I could have it for the same price  Huge two very comfortable king beds two comfy chairs with ottomans a desk and armoire with t v   Bathroom wasnt huge but we managed  Foyer was large to accomodate our luggage so as not to mess up sleeping area  The or was very funky and fun  Afternoon wine hour was a hit in the lovely common area with fireplace  Concierge was helpful as was the valet team  The one bad thing and it was bad was after a full day of shopping we returned to our room at about  for a quick change for our dinner reservations and our room had not been cleaned no fresh towels nothing  When I called they immediately sent somebody to our room wtowels then finished after we left for the evening  Despite that I will definitely stay again  
N => Too Snotty and        for Me DisappointedThe first time we went to Chicago we stayed at the Hotel Burnham  The hotel was fabulous the rooms were exquisite and the service was impeccable  As a result we wanted to try another Kimpton Boutique Hotel and after seeing the reviews we ided to stay at the Monaco  When we first arrived the front desk staff was rude and acted as if we were inconveniencing them when we asked for the added touch of the pet goldfish  They cared more about their chic instead of their job  The rooms were nice and large and my fiancee loved the little alcove where he could stare at all the activity outside  The next morning after our room was serviced VERY LATE AND we did not receive new glasses or the ironing board returned to its original location  An addition to the other amenities the Monaco provides a complimentary wine hour  During this hour we went across the street to the White Hen to pick up some juice for in the morning  After returning to the hotel the front desk staff advised us of the wine hour  We politely said that we  come down later  Looking at our juice he then emphasized to us that the wine hour was quotFREEquot insinuating that cost was a factor to us and we were being cheap  That night we wanted to eat at an italian restaurant and the concierge recommended a place  minutes away stating that the staff eats there regularly  The food at Nick amp Tonys THE GRILL ROOM was horrible UNLESS YOU HAVE NO TATSEBUDS  We only ate two bites and then ided to eat sandwiches from White Hen  The next day we ate at a much better location for a lot better price off Michigan  We had a great time in Chicago but for the true hotel experience I am staying at the Burnham  
N => Amazing views charming European feel Great rooms   suite have  window seats as big as single beds Japanese soaking tub  Charming and sumptuous hotel  Lots of European charm with a very eager to please staff  Jewel of Chicago  Wanted to keep it a secret or there will be no rooms left when I want to go  Worth every penny  The goldfish a bit quirky Great Location  
N => Absolutely adorable We stayed here in ch in a suite that was simple adorable Love the contemporary or and the Aveda bath products  The  seat jacuzzi was wonderful and attention to details was much appreciated from the light dimmer in the bathroom to the gold fish which was brought up within  minutes of our request  The window ledge made a memorable bed under the stars and the main bed was the most comfortable weve ever slept in The lobby was small but cozy and the staff was friendly enough  I highly recommend the suite to couples on romantic vacations  Look on the hotel web site for packages  
N => Loved Hotel Monaco We loved our stay at Hotel Monaco in Chicago We stayed there in uary and it was cold but Hotel Monaco was a great place to keep warm  It is so centrally located we were able to walk to almost all of our destinations  The staff was so helpful even recommending amp reserving us a table at an excellent restaurant  The wine hour is definitely a bonus Loved the rooms the staff   what a great place  I definitely recommend it  
N => We love Hotel Monaco  
N => it was ok  
N => Huge Room  
N => Miss the House of Blues    This was our first time staying at the Hotel Sax since it was converted from the House of Blues  The vibe is very hip and the location is great but the room was not up to par with the price we paid  There were major chips in the tub a burned out light bulb in the bathroom that wasnt changed in our  day stay and when I went to plug in my laptop the outlet plate fell off in my hand leaving the outlet completely exposed  There are so many great places to stay in Chicago we wont be back to the Sax  
N => Very nice deal great amenities not cheap but affordable for the quality The room was VERY modern and trendy  It had a lot of cool orations quot Plasma TV  High quality minibar although we didnt touch it because it was a fortune Be careful though because even if you take something off the minibar it automatically charges you for it it has these cool sensor pads  We got a pretty good deal I think about   off the room because we went in il not the busy season Other pros Great Location Within walking distance to all major attractions Fun quotGame roomquot with Nintendo Wii X Box  etc Right next door the the House of Blues  Staff was very friendly although I dont think we had a single problem Bathroom had very nice robes a heating lamp to help you dry off faster and everything was very up to dateCons It was almost too trendy for me even though Im a fairly quothipquot  year old D Parking wasnt free but I dont think it ever is around there  I actually somehow ended up in the employee parking section and only had to pay  a day 
N => Urban classy but iffy reservations even after confirmed Stayed here for my bachelorette party  Check in was a bit stressful  We had confirmed reservations for  adjoining rooms because of our large group but when we got there we were told that room was no longer available  First they said they could get us rooms close to each other but that wasnt going to work for gift opening etc  They eventually upgraded us to a suite which we all fit in  It was HUGE and very clean with great views of the city  When we checked in others around us were having trouble with their reservations from rd party discount sites ours were made directly with the hotel  The hotel had given their rooms away too and for some people they werent able to accomodate them  So even if you have a confirmed reservation Id still recommend a back up be or not take the chance even though the hotel overall is amazing  Crimson Lounge near the lobby was fun to start off the night  Dim lighting sexy upscale but not stuffy great drinks and friendly bartenders  Hotel is close to everything  We walked to all of our dinner and party locations  
N => Not worth the price The best thing about this hotel was the view  When we arrived it took about  minutes to get a valet to even recognize us and give us a ticket for the car  The room was ready early and they let us check in about an hour before the standard check in time  Our room was disappointing except for the view  The headboard was practically falling off the wall and the nightstand was actually leaning against the wall not attached to anything  All the staff we came in contact with after the valet were more than helpful and accommodating especially the bellhop  
N => Be careful about checkout charges We purchased our room for  nights through Priceline  We had printed our confirmation and brought it with us  Our last night we got the bill from the hotel under the door for about  for quotpromotional room ratequot We questioned this charge and were told that we had only purchased one night through priceline  I had called our credit card and we indeed had purchased  nights  We took our print out of confirmation for the  nights we already paid to the front desk and the initially removed the charge  HOWEVER when I received our credit card bill about  weeks later there was a charge of  besides the  charge for housing our car for  nights I called to talk to the manager and she said that quotthey investigated it and we had only purchased  nightquot so they charged us after we left on our credit card for   I said oh no we had purchased  nights and showed the front desk clerk our receipt  She asked for the confirmation email to prove this from priceline Long story short it took me awhile to convince this manager that we had paid for  nights through priceline  She made me feel like we were trying to fraud the hotel  We originally had a good experience with the hotel but ended up on a VERY sour note And through all this the manager never offered anything for the headache she put us through  
N => Great Young Vibe The staff was really kind room was clean but might be too quotyouthfulquot for older guests  We arrived on a Thursday night and the lobby bar was quotbumpinquot like a club which didnt bode well for our long journey  Whoever designed their reation must have been fresh out of school because it was too many trends thrown in at once  Snake skinned high back chair with mirrored nightstand Ouch Not much counterspace in the bathroom though We got a good promo at the time for  w free parking  Great location but might want to stay at another more subdued place next time  
N => We loved our first visit We made our first trip to Chicago for our th anniversary  After studying and agonizing over all the hotel choices online   I booked us at Hotel Sax through Expedia  We got good enough rates  The hotel was all we needed   good location close to public transportation nice friendly helpful staff our room was CLEAN the or somewhat eclectic   but if you want the same old hotel   stay at one of the major chains  We thoroughly enjoyed our  day trip Nice comfy robes good quick room service   FANTASTIC shower nice toiletries  
N => Didnt get reserved room type and room dirty We booked this hotel through hotels com and prepaid for a Superior King room  When we checked in and got to our room the room was small and the bed looked like full size  I called the front desk takled to the manager  She said that unfortunately when you book through a third party vendor such as Expedia or Hotels com they cannot guarantee the room type and that they were sold out for the night  I asked if we could get a discount and she said no  I indicated that our view was a view of the parking garage and she said that most all rooms have a view of the parking garage The hotel room was small and when I walked around barefoot someones hair pin stuck to the bottom of my foot along with hair  The bathroom just had a shower stall no bathtub  The halls were super dark and gloomy  There are no vending amenities at the hotel to buy bottled water soda etc  I do not recommend this hotel and will be staying somewhere else for our next trip to Chicago 
N => No longer worth it My husband and I spend a few weekends a year in Chicago and loved this hotel when it was the House of Blues  After our stay this weekend we were very disappointed  We reserved a king room and were given an incredibly small dark room with a queen bed  When we spoke to guest services to change to a room that met the reservation expectations we were not treated very well  They were not willingable to honor what we booked and did not seem to think it was a problem  The room lighting was so dim I was not able to see to apply make up once the sun had set  The wall behind the bed had a section that was falling off and the overall look was pretty shabby  This was not at all what we had experienced during previous visits to the House of Blues  Friends of ours stayed in a hotel nearby  They had a fabulous room spacious and well lit too and were treated very well  While we look forward to our next wonderful visit to the Windy City we wont make the mistake of booking a room here again  
N => Dark Smelled Like Rot Personal Items Stolen or on the rock star side of things   interesting to look at but not to live with for  days  The hallways were too dark to navigate with anything more than your room key   not the case when youre there on business  The bed was comfy  The shower did not drain well not unusual  The hallways smell in the mornings of stagnant water   which didnt help our enjoyment of breakfast in the hotel restaurant  And the stolen items   thats where value and service take the downgraded rating  
N => Funky Hotel   Great Location We were in Chicago for three nights to visit our son who was moving into his first apartment in the city  We picked the Hotel Sax because of the proximity to our son s apartment but turns out to be a great location in the city for many reasons restaurants shopping historical sites etc   Our room was a Deluxe King overlooking the  corn cob  building and the river  Loved the funky d cor of the room  Bed was very comfortable nice linens  The bathroom was also well orated modern cool chic  Overall very nice room   clean comfortable and updated  We are not the types to stay up late we used to be but if you want entertainment there is plenty right in the complex with the hotel Crimson Lounge House of Blues Bin even Dick s Last Resort  Given our sons new address in Chicago we will be returning 
N => Bed Bugs I stayed end of il for the first time   Hotel Sax  Got a good rate but quotpaidquot in the long run Hotel looks fabulous upon arrival but you will regret your stay the very next morning after itching all the way home  Room was not clean and I had bites all over  Management was unresponsive to my email explaining my dilemma  I travel to Chicago for business about   times per month and will NOT ever stay here again  Stay at your own risk but pack some bug spray  
N => Great sax The Sax was just perfect for us  We got a fantastic deal through travelzoo for  which included free parking and two drinks at the bar Checked in early and requested a Chicago River view which was awesome we got to watch the river turn green from the comfort of our roomThe staff across the board could not have been more helpful  Our room while not huge was comfortable clean and well appointed It was so great to walk next door at night and catch a show at The House of Blues tooThe hotel bar was swank comfortable and the staff was wonderful  
N => well be back everything was fantastic here  rooms were beautiful  beds were very comfy  shower was great  view was great  location was great  price was great  Highly recommended the only thing they need are vending machines  its hard to find a coke for a reasonable price under  
N => Speak up We stayed at this location in  when it was The House of Blues  We liked the area so ided to book a King room at the recently reated Hotel Sax  We requested early check in amp got a room right away  We were told that only a Queen room was available  When we got to the room on the th floor we were extremely disappointed   the bathroom was so tiny that the sink was in the bedroom area amp that area was also very small  I called the desk to complain amp the receptionist said quotyou booked through Expediaquot then said she could give us a room with  double beds   I immediately said yes since we wanted out of that tiny room  The nd room was much bigger amp had a nice flat screen TV  I had requested a fridge amp asked if there was a coffee maker in the room amp was told no but they would send one up  She also mentioned a microwave amp I asked what the charges would be  She said there was no charge amp sent the items up  There were floor to ceiling windows that opened  The view was of the unique condoparking towers amp The House of Blues which is very busy every night of the week but being on the th floor the noise was minimal They provide in room safe ironboard bathrobes mini bar nice toiletries amp power rain shower that feels like a massage  The Crimson Lounge on the main floor is very popular lively amp quite expensive  Bin  is right next door as well as  Pin Bowling Alley amp Lounge  Harry Carays Bar amp Restaurant is nearby  Boat tours are also close by  We took the River Tour on Chicagos First Lady which has volunteers from the Chicago Architecture Foundation who are extremely knowledgeable Hints Go to Shaws Crab House  E  Hubbard St  for half price oysters  to  pm  Check out the free days for the Shedd Aquarium  Lincoln Park Zoo is always free  Take the   bus at the stop just around the corner from the hotel  There is also a free shuttle to Navy Pier   great burgers at Charlies Ale House 
N => Fell Short of Potential A beautiful building in the perfect location for convenient nightlife fun  Unfortunately service and exeuction by the staff was greatly lacking  Requests generally to fix something which was not initially right were repeatedly dropped  They were great at apologizing but not at recifying or obviously preventing issues The Microsoft Enhanced Technology rooms are a cool idea   but they did not deliver or even have any of the requested and promised games or music   and their own laptops would not connect to the Internet Not a good testimonial to either Microsoft or Hotel SaxSo close to a great spot   yet so far from deliveringWe will definitely try another hotel during our next stay in this great city  
N => Average To Below Average Stayed at Hotel Sax for  nights in ust  The hotel almost tries to hard to be something that it isnt Room service terrible  I had to follow up twice and on arrival food was very cold and not edible  Contacted service to request a replacement   never arrivedRoom is very small and a bit tired  In room reading material mentions minibar  I thought I was going insane so I phoned customer support to be advised there was no minibar in my room  Why advise in reading material of the mini bar thenI did not think the staff were overly helpful either  Plus side is location is excellent for sightseeing  
N => Good Overall  Average for Downtown Hotels  Good hotel overall Pluses  champaign amp peanuts in shell at front desk upon Friday night arrival  Large bathroom  quot LCD was fantastic th floor computergaming roomNegatives not enough lighting next to bed but my   negative is that the bed itself was not on par with higher end hotels   I thought it was kind of hard and not even  I dont agree with previous reviews that it was soft  The comforter was very warm so you really had to turn the room temperature down  Ironing board was broke and had to use while laying it on the bed  Wife said she did not have enough counter space in bathroom for all her cosmetics  Bath tub wasnt a sunken tub  No coffeemaker but coffee was available in lobby although it could have been better quality though for hotel level Booked via priceline for ltnight so it was a very good value  
N => Great as long as you dont use their Valet service It saddens me that I cant write a rave review about the SAX  It started out great the room was immaculate bathroom huge the flat screen TV had access to HD channels wireless access was seemless and the bed was extremely comfortable and soft  The location was excellent just a short walk to the Miracle Mile and Merchant t  My husband and I were contemplating extending our stay at the hotel because it was so comfortable and well perfect  That is until we retrieved our car from the valet lot a day after we checked in  Our car had been ransacked with every compartmented rumaged through and our belongings scattered  Luckily we removed all valuable items from the car except for some quarters intended for parking those were stolen but it felt violating to have our car vandalized like that  When we complained to hotel management they immediately said that they do not run the valet parking service and they just send guests to the lot since its right across the way  And of course the parking service didnt want to take responsibility either  My perception of valet parking is that the car is kept in a safe place where it wouldnt be ransacked so obviously this kind of service was unacceptable to me  I was tired of getting the runaround so I asked that we not be chared for parking that first night I parked on the street after that and they did remove the charge  We ided not to extend our stay after that experience and their indifference to what had happened ruined our experience with the hotel  
N => Kinda Weird Actually My company has a business rate with this location and of all the Chicago area hotels Im really shocked they chose this one  Most of my younger early  something colleagues tend to like this location but Im not completely sold on it I find theyre trying so hard to be trendy that it becomes annoying All of my contacts with the staff were very pleasant Gettting to the room proved tough as the sixth floor was very dark and the rooms were poorly labeled The room was comfortable and plush but again tried too hard to be trendy  I found the bathroom to be odd  With a long walk from the shower to the sink counter top on a cold floor  Had I stayed long Id have requested extra bath towels simply to quotcarpetquot the floor I did not use the hotels internet service but did use their valet parking which I found to be very expensive    but probably on par with what other downtown hotels charge  
N => Great hotel   Impeccable concierge service We recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hotel Sax in Chicago for a brief New Years visit to bring in  My wife and I along with our  teenage sons and  of their classmates had a most enjoyable stay at the hotel and experienced unmatched levels of courtesy and service from the hotel staff  We thought the computer gamesactivity room was a great idea and we wonder why more hotels dont offer an amenity like this to provide a fun safe and convenient entertainment option for the kids to enjoy especially teenagers The concierge in particular a Ms  S  C  was most helpful in assisting us with the usual quotwhat to see what to doquot drill and we really appreciate her personal attention to our many questions and requests  She is an asset to the organization We would not hesitate to stay at Hotel Sax again and look forward to a return visit to Chicago one of our favorite cities  We have enthusiasticlly recommended the hotel   and Chicago   to our friends relatives and colleagues Thank you Hotel Sax for making our visit so pleasant and relaxing  We will be back JGS 
N => Needs some work quick  Used to stay here when it was the House of Blues Hotel  I really liked it even though teh rooms were small because it is really convenient and the people were nice  Now the lobby is bigger but it is very cold and white not inviting at all  The rooms are still small but now they are a weird purple gray color and that minimal IKEA kind of furniture  The only people I recognized from my last stay were the bellman  They are still great but it seems the hotel told them they are no longer allowed to temporarily park cars next to the lobby  I had picked up a rental car at Hertz to go visit a customer out west  and just wanted to run to my room to check email and gather up my things be  minutes at most but I had to put my car in the garage  Well people started showing up for some show at the House Of Blues and it was a zoo when I came down for my car  Not only did it cost me a lot but it took over half an hour to get it  I was almost late for dinner  Looks like they changed the bartoo which is too bad  It didnt appear to be open yet but it looks like it is going to be some really loud pretentious kind of club  Not sure how business people are going to react  I quit staying at the Hyatt because of the loud club over there  Oh and the price seemed really high for something that is still not finished too  
N => Great Experience We arrived on il th for  nights and before we arrived we had heard about the construction that was underway at the hotel but was pleasently supprized when we arrived  It is true that the main lobby is closed for remolding but we did not feel their was any inconvience with the temporary lobby on the th floor  We had heard that they were remolding the rooms with new carpet and a toned down wall and bed coverings  We arrive by  am that morning and we were told previously to get a coner room for better veiws and when we arrived a room was not avialable but they were very nice and told us that we would have a room with in the hour  We did get our room about pm and the room was great  They have installed quot flat screen TVs in the new rooms and you could still smell the new carpet  Everything about the room exceeded our expectations even though they were not huge they were very well laid out  The only negatitive comments would be the cable tv could of had more chaneels and at least one movie channel  But overall re would stongly recommend this hotel because of their location and their rooms  Even though this hotel is transitioning to the HOTEL SAX this is still a great place to stay  
N => Not what we expected The House of Blues IS going through a major reation  There is no lobby when you arrive just a person at a podium sending you to the th floor where there is a makeshift desk and some one to check you in  Not a soul around  felt like the twilight zone  One of the main reasons we booked at the HOB is becaseu we were traveling with our teenage son and thought it would be a lively place to stay next time we will stay at the Hard Rock  Our one bedroom suite was lovely with the exception of the pull out sofa bed  The mattress was so thin you could feel the springs underneath  The Conceirge was rude when you could actually get a hold of them we booked tickets to the Sunday Gospel Brunch wrong number of tickets and when I asked what time we should arrive for the  seating we were told quotquot  Actually it is family style seating and buffet which means if you dont get there ahead of time you are left to wait in line to eat for upwards of  minutes  The bowling alley is awesome too bad we didnt get to use it When we checked in we were not told that we would need to make a reservation to bowl  We tried to bowl on a Saturday afternoon but it was a two hour wait Bellmen were great  
N => perfect We stayed  nights on the house of blues hotel in Chicago and it was very good Friendly staff lovely interior perfect location and close to all the sights in chicagoand right next to all the stores on michigan avenue   There was also a very good blues concert next to the lobby one night   A bit expensive hotelbar but all in all a very good hotel that was just perfect for our visit to chicago  
N => Great Location   Construction wasnt that bad I stayed in room   for three nights during a tradeshow at McCormick Place  The concierge Amy was terrific  I had to call her in advance of my trip to make some special transportation arrangements and she was all over my request and contacted me with frequent updates  The front desk was friendly and quick  My room was generously sized with a comfortable king size bed  Yes there was construction but I didnt find it any more disruptive than regular city noise  In fact I stayed in my room late one morning to finish a presentation and hardly noticed it  Terrific location with a VTK Vongs Vietnam Kitchen next door with fast take out service if you want something good eat but dont want to eat alone or order from room service  
N => Geat Stay Friendly staff We recently traveled to Chicago for the first time for a weekend getaway  We ided on the House of Blues Hotel because of location and reviews  We also wanted to go to the Gospel Brunch next door on Sunday  The hotel was booked full the night before but they were still able to let us check in early  The staff was very friendly  The room was very nice and the bed was comfortable  The only downer to the room was the mini bar which like all mini bars is way overpriced  When you pay that much for a room they should just give youa bottle of water The bathroom was fine but the tub  shower was more of a shower  You would have to work hard to fit into the tub  It was  to  size  Everything else was good  The bell station was helpful and kept our bags while we looked around some more on Sunday  We had a great stay  
N => Chicago  great place to visit The location of the House of Blues Hotel was great  the room was a little small but very clean  When flying into OHare Airport I would recommend taking the CTA the Chicago Subway to the hotel  For   you can take the Blue Line to Clark and Lake Street  it takes about   min but its alot less than a cab  We went to a Cub game at Wrigley field  great time  would def  recommend seeing a game if possible  Also walk to the Navy pier lots to do from the Navy pier we took the water taxi to the Sears Tower   ride on the Chicago river to the Sears Tower  we got to our destination while getting a scenic ride down the river  Must go to lunch at FOGO de CHAO  N LaSalle ST  go for lunch bc its alot less expensive  amazing food  they give you  different types of meat where you can have as much as you want  unlimited sides and salad bar  lunch is  per person  dinner   Great place 
N => Loved this place  
N => A fun place to stay  
N => Dont bother  
N => molto bello il sax hotel  
N => What a dive We were very conflicted about staying in this hotel because due to the pictures on the site  It looked kinda dumpy but not too bad  Upon our arrival we COULD NOT believe our eyes  IT WAS DISGUSTING It was filthy run down unsafe looking smelly and overall well   disgusting We got the key to quotcheck out the roomquot sat down at the falling apart rickity table and chairs that were in the room and frantically dialed other hotels in the area to beg them for an open room for the weekend  Thank goodness the RED ROOF INN on E  Ontario St  had an open room for the weekend  If anyone on here has anything good to say about this hotel BESIDES the fact that its close to downtown youve got to be taking crazy pills  
N => If you want a place to pass out after a long day of sightseeing    Ok  I had looked at all the reviews and was dubious  So I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised  The bathroom was a bit dated but it was VERY CLEAN  The beds were softer than I prefer but it wasnt bad  I always travel with a clothespin to keep the light out from the curtains and I was glad that I did  When we came into the room one of the lights and the refrigerator which I wasnt even expecting werent working  We called the desk to report it took off for a quick lunch at that AWESOME McDonalds that was very close by and when we returned all was fixed  We found the location VERY convenient to the HardRock Cafe Rainforest Cafe Sports Authority and Fogo de Chao  We felt very safe walking to and from the hotel  The desk staff was great  IF you arent really fussy and just want a place thats clean and not too badly located this is for you  The  bus goes right by which was great for us as we had taken the train to Chicago and that bus goes directly to Union Station  
N => Clean Hotel in a Good Location We stayed in this hotel for  nights  Despite the surly attitude at the check in desk things went fairly smoothly and we were given a room on the third floor  The elevator is scary and old moves slowly and feels like it might plummet to the ground at any time so we took the stairs after the first time  The hallways arent pretty but we opened a door to a fair sized room with  rather comfy beds  The free internet was a nice bonus though it wasnt   reliable in our room we enjoyed a flawless connection in the adjacent cafe the next morning  Bathrooms are small but the water is hot and the pressure was good  Above all the room was CLEAN  Location not bad   close to shops attractions and restaurants  They also held our luggage for us free of charge after we checked out when we wanted to spend our last day in the city without lugging heavy bags around  
N => Not for single female travellers This hotel did not feel safe to me and as a female travelling alone this was important  The rooms are accessed straight from the car park   which can be accessed by anyone not just guests from the street  I had requested a non smoking room but it smelt of smoke  When I reported this they sent someone round with an air freshner I promtly checked out and went and stayed somewhere else 
N => Lower what you expect to see save a ton of money If you have read any of my reviews over the years you know I pull no punches  Upon arrival to this property if I would have immediately written a review it would be a lot different than the one I am writing  First of all the hotel is old and certainly dated  It is not what any of us would expect but if you just relax and give the place  hours it is plain to see it aint so bad The room was as clean as any hotel I have stayed in the rate was one third what everything else was within  blocks of this property I felt safe at all times and there was even free parking  The hotel was a short walk to some great bars and restaurants and the staff was friendly and helpful  They did have free Wi Fi but if you were not in certain rooms it would not work but I just walked to the lobby and did my thing  I would stay here again  It saved my company  bucks over two nights since there were three rooms involved  Remember just relax and give the place a little time to grown on you  
N => Clean safe room for good price nice convenient area I was in Chicago for the weekend visiting some family and meeting friends for a few days  My hope was to find a ent hotel close to the downtown area I would be going to most and not be too expensive  Most hotels in the area were outragiously high around  a night  I finally found the Howard Johnson but saw mixed reviews here and at other sites  I took the chance and was pleasantly surprised  The room was clean and ently maintained  It was an older hotel with older furnishings but I basically wanted a clean room to sleep and shower in  And HoJo provided it It was easlily within walking distance to Hard Rock Cafe House of Blues Coyote Ugly Rock Bottom Brewery and many local restaurants  The area was nicely lit and felt safe  And if you needed to go further around town it was easy to get a cab For my next trip to Chicago this will be the first place I check for availability  
N => Do Not Stay Here Our room was so dirty we chose not to stay in it for even one night  Like the other reviewer we also did not feel safe  Thankfully we were there early enough to check out before we were charged   and I must say the hotel employee at the front desk was very accomodating when we told him we would not be staying If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in downtown Chicago stay at the Congress Plaza  It is cheaper than the HoJo   we got a night internet rate   infinitely cleaner and in a much better location  If you are worried about what you have read about the picketers dont be there are only  or  of them they are off to the side and they dont look at you or make any noise  
N => Good choice This hotel gave me exactly what I was looking for a fairly cheap rate as Chicago goes which allowed me to spend my money on other things  The free parking was a real plus  Somone said that it was hard to find I found it incredibly easy to locate just south of Superior on Lasalle  Room was a little dingy could use a coat of paint etc  but it was clean and in a great location  If you like spending  a night plus another  for parking for a more upscale hotel you probably wont want to stay here  If you are looking for an inexpensive place to sleep that is in a great location and want to spend your money on the many attractions Chicago has to offer this is a great value  I would definitely stay here again  
N => dirty run down I am not one of those picky people  Often I stay at Motel   But this was one of the worst motels Ive stayed at  Stayed in room d  When I entered the hall leading to my room it stunk of urine  My wife was looking forward to taking a bath but refused because the tub was dirty  The sink was all scratched up and stained  The dry wall between the seink and tub was rotting and mildewed from water damage  The second day I was there I had no hot water to take a shower  They couldnt tell me when it would be fixed and their answer was to take  off the night  The ONLY two things it had positive was the free parking and the proximity to attarctions  Oh yah breakfast was good and reasionably priced at the Lasalle diner in front  
N => Not Bad OK for the money  was expecting worse  good position No problems here but probably could do with a face lift  bathroom clean Good position  independant probably would go up a grade next time 
N => Excellent Location Free Parking  We stayed here for a couple of nights over the th of y weekend last summer  We had never been to Chicago before  We are not fussy people but like a clean place where there are some services like coffee in the a m  The diner downstairs was so great for a quick bite so you didnt have to head out right away just to get started  You can walk to all kinds of things If youre looking for a fancy place with lots of amenities this should not be your choice  Its a great way to check out the city see where you spend your time all at a reasonable price We brought our motorcycle in our truck and unloaded it right there  We rode all over the place and left the bike in front of the truck at night  No problems at all The rooms are old and small but very clean and we found to be quiet I would stay here again without reservation  We cant wait until we can return to see the stuff we couldnt get to  
N => Great Hotel Overall I was very happy to have stayed in this hotel The outside was a little scary but our actual room was very clean  Our TV set had video in and audio ins so I could watch movies with the portable DVD player I brought  There was a coffee maker a blow dryer and a few little extras as well  The hotel staff was great and very responsive  Within a few minutes of my entering the room the front desk called just to check if everything was to my liking And to top it off free parking in downtown Chicago    You cant go wrong by staying here  
N => Our stay literally stank Based on the good reviews posted on TripAdvisor we chose to stay at this hotel this past ober and I do regret it  The room was supposedly non smoking but was permeated with accumulated smoke  In spite of the strong strong smell of some kind of industrial air freshener the smoke smell was in everything  It was so strong in the pillows etc that I barely got any sleep  We checked in very late so there was no time to play room roulette in search of another one   plus if this passed as non smoking we didnt hold much hope for any others The best thing I can say about it was there was free parking but had we known how old and smoky everything would be we would have made another choice  
N => OK for the price I paid live in the South these days  First problem was customer service if you can call it that  Called HoJo support line from the El asking where the nearest stop to Hotel was  The office was in New Brunswick Canada and didnt know  The room was kinda small with the usual lousy generic heat pump  They have a restaurant on the grounds good for breakfast lunch busy and dinner only until pm  couldnt get late checkout bc they were filling up but they did let me keep my luggage in the office  surprising to see a low rise motel in a business section like that  But it was OK for the price  
N => Other guests not the best  
N => Cheap as chips  
N => I Expected MUCH More From A Hyatt We got this room for a great rate but we still expected a standard four to five star Hyatt experience  Yes it enjoys a great location but the facility has to be twenty five years old and while there have been some facelifts given its still pretty shabby Here are the lowlightsGot to the room and noticed that there was some black stuff in the caulking around the tub  See photos  I mentioned it to the front desk staffer who apologized profusely  She said the housekeeping manager would get right on it while we were out at dinner We got back from dinner and   still had the black stuff in the tub  So the next morning I brought it to the attention of the new front desk staffer on duty and she too apologized profusely  Using almost identical wording as the first woman  As if there were a script she was following    We asked her to have the housekeeping team address it while we were out at breakfast so that we could have a clean tub for the rest of our stay Shockingly there was no change in our tub after breakfast  Went back to the counter spoke with the same staffer from earlier in the morning  She asked if wed like to move to a new room which while inconvenient sounded like a good idea  To her credit she did offer to give us some sort of freebie for our trouble  But since I didnt need free internet or food vouchers there was apparently nothing else she could offer me  I asked if they could comp my  parking bill yes thats a daily rate Sorry no dice  So we went to look at the new room  Unfortunately it had gunk in the tub too See photo Whats This FoolishnessMaking matters worse when we returned from breakfast we found that our sheets actually had multiple rips and tears in them It was impossible to miss them which tells me that the housekeeping staff either didnt care or wasnt given the guidance that you know ripped sheets dont really enhance the Hyatt brand So I pulled the ripped sheets off the bed and went back to the front desk  We told the desk agent wed stay in our original room since the new one wasnt much better  I think the sarcasm was lost on him  Once again profuse apologies housekeeping manager will be calling you putting our best people on it yadda yadda We have two more nights here  It will be interesting to see how this plays out     
N => Hyatt class Staff and service were excellent from directions to room service  Ultra clean rooms food was wonderful  Perfect walking distince to Mile shopping and most sights  Loved everything about this hotel  If you want class stay at the Hyatt Regency 
N => Absolute nighte   overbooked displaced and then charged for a room I didnt even stay in  I stayed here for a conference with a reservation for one room  The hotel was overbooked and we were forced to stay one night in a different hotel  In the process of checking back in to the Hyatt for the rest of the nights somehow two rooms were created under my name  I received keys to one room and when checking out was informed of only one room  The bill was split between my roommate and I  Upon checking my card I found that I was charged not only for half of one room but a full bill for a room I never stayed in  When disputing the claim I was informed that the extra charge could not be removed because someone did stay in that room  Does this hotel not check if they gave keys to anyone if anyone actually checked in and used a room or inform someone when they check out about all of the rooms listed under their name 
N => Great location nice rooms very accommodating staff Every part of this stay went smoothly  One of our party checked in early after I called to ask that she be able to check into a room under my name  When the rest of the party arrived we were upgraded to a room with a wonderful view so that we could be close to the st room  This was a quick girls weekend  We spent a lot of time at the Big Bar but missed the touted piano bar because of scheduling conflicts  The drinks were expensive but location couldnt be beat Location of the hotel was wonderful easy walking distance to Navy Pier the BillyGoat Tavern the SNL Cheezborger Cheezborger shrine shopping and many other attractions Every staff member we spoke to went out of their way to be accommodating  We will be back 
N => Chicago athon My son ran in the athon so we wanted to be close to the action  Hyatt fit the billl  Great location  Downtown and close to all attractions  Walked eveywhere  Can not complain about location  The Hyatt did not live up to expectations  Long lines to check in  And once checked in very disappointed  Housekeeping was bad  Rooms smelled bad and were dusty  Burn holes in the carpet of a non smokng room wallpaper peeling offetc   They claimed we were smoking and tried to charge us    Guest services were great and fixed everything but Id think twice before staying here again  
N => HUGE hotel Little to no service but amazing stay  When we first checked in we ided to use the automated check in to avoid the line  it seemed easier  The line was completely empty and had been for  minutes by the time we FINALLY got our keys  This part of the process completely eliminated any contact with Hyatt employees as well so avoid this if at all possible  Its always nice to be greeted by a person if you have the option rather than a machine We got our room key and went to the elevators went up to our floor and realized that our room wasnt in that tower  that our room in fact was across the street at the other tower  Had we used an actual person instead of the machine  we probably would have known this before wasting our time traveling up to the wrong floor Once we finally got to our room everything was amazing  The view was incredible we have a view of the river and the Magnificent Mile  The bathroom was very clean  The room itself was incredible  Aside from the view the bed was a nice size and very comfortable the TV was a nice sized flat screen The only downsides to the room were that housekeeping didnt come until about pm usually which is a little too late especially if we want to come back after a morning walk or something the other downside was the water pressuretemperature  The pressure was VERY low and the temperature was very fickle  very rarely was it always hot you usually had to wait about  minutes for the temperature to get to a reasonable degree But those two downsides aside everything else was awesome  I cant say much to the service level experienced at the Hyatt as we werent really in need of a whole lot of service  but no one really went out of their way to say quotHiquot or ask how our stay was If you do stay here dont miss Big Bar its a elty but definitely is something worth checking out  They have some really good and really big drinks and the bartenders are all really nice In all there werent too many things negative about our stay  We were neutral on some levels but on the levels where it really truly counts Hyatt went above and beyond our expectations and I would stay here again in a heartbeat  
N => I would stay again   We stayed here one night but it was great  Staff was great and our room was a good view  We had a good time at the quotBIGquot bar and would recommend stopping in  
N => Paper Thin Walls First let me start out by saying that I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member and stay in Hyatt hotels in other cities when I travel This was our third stay at this particular hotel and needless to say the most disappointing  Let me rewind the tape  Last year we stayed in this hotel just before Christmas   The location is excellent for shopping and the rooms have a very good view  Unfortunately our stay was spoiled by a late night party that the hotel staff could not get under control  To their credit they provided us with a complimentary nights stay should we return which we did last week  When we checked in this time we reminded them of the problem we had last year and asked them to locate us into a room that would hopefully be very quiet this time around  All was going great until approximately  am when we heard a man scream very loudly from the room next door  This was followed by deep moans groansand screams from a women and it was obvious there was some very intense business going on   Now this was not just any ordinary session taking place it was right out of the movies and went on for what seemed to be an eternity  I am not criticizing what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own room but the walls of this hotel are paper thin and what should have been private was anything but and I mean this was REALLY LOUD  When we checked out in the morning we were asked how our stay was and again offered a complimentary stay and breakfast with their deepest apologies  So let me wrap it up and sumize This hotel is in a great location and the staff especially ia are top notch  We love Stetsons restaurant  And the morning breakfast buffet was fantastic  But if you are looking for a quiet night and a good nights rest it is a real crap shoot  
N =>  Hotel security  I had to reluctantly switch from the wonderful Peninsula to the Hyatt Regency on Wacker for financial reasons  My husband who made the reservation was in conference  I had to move our stuff from the other hotel and check in which I did with absolutely no problems  My six year old son and I put away our things and went out for a day of museum hopping  Meanwhile my husbands conference ended and he needed to get changed out of his business suit but had no key  He explained to the concierge and they gave him two new room keys  When my son and I came to the room he had left for dinner already and my two keys were inactivated so I could not get inside the room  I went downstairs to get new keys explaining that I suppose when my husband got his keys mine we inactivated and the concierge refused to give me new keys or let me in the room because my name same last name though wasnt on the reservation  I was needless to say furious  They explained that it was for security purposes  I then explained forcefully that that was bull because if they were so concerned about security they wouldnt have let a six foot five man into a room that a  lb woman and small child had already checked into I mean hey thats SAFE right They finally acquiesced to let me in IF I could prove that my stuff was in the room  What an idiotic policyOne other note there were no less than THREE pubic hairs stuck to the bathtub when I checked in Disgusting 
N => Good location and view but busy and noisy The hotel was doing an offer where there were offering a Regency Club room for the same price as a standard room  We ided to take up this option and ended up with a room on the th floor Room  which had a great view out over the river and Navy Pier The room itself was exactly as the pictures on the website portrayed with a nice comfortable bed  There was a safe in the room which meant we could safely stow away our valuables and this was big enough to hold our cameras as well as cash etc The only criticisms of the hotel was it was extremely busy and noisy we had heard it described as a railway station and this rang true  We were also in the West Tower and trying to get the lift to our floor took a long time as they were extremely busy We made use of the Regency Club lounge but as the promotion was being offered by the hotel it was extremely busy in the evening with nowhere to sit until other guests had finished  We spent our time in the adjoining business centre on the PC to kill a bit of time It was quieter in the morning but we were there fairly early as we didn t get a good night s sleep with other guests returning to their rooms at all hours of the night   and not being quiet about it  
N => Great location Great central location in the Loop in walking distance to the shops on Michigan Ave  to the north and the Art Institute to the south  A little difficult to get to by train though its theoretically possible we ended up taking a cab a few blocks Only stayed one night so cant give too much detail but I have no complaints  Very basic but nice  Defintely not worth the list price of around  but I got the room for  on Hotwire so I was satisfied  
N => Hotel Overbooked Confirmed reservation room not available no refund Arrived late in the evening for prepaid room to be told that the hotel was overbooked  Had to drag luggage  blocks to another hotel  Was told refund would be made no refund yet they dont even respond  If you need a room for sure for a business meeting or whatever book somewhere else  Other people had same problem  Hotel itself is warn and rundown  
N => Great place great location   no problems Like a few others I went to the Hyatt kind of expecting a dump because of all the negative posts  No unusual problems   elevators were quick service was good room was clean bed was comfy I didnt encounter noise problems and I saw several room service trays in our hallway in the morning so I know we werent alone up there  We had a south view which was all they had available when we checked in but no big deal  The only problem I would point out was Daddy Os was supposed to be open until am and when we walked in at am they immediately told us they were closed even though there were several people in there    thought that was really rude   they directed us to the Big Bar that stays open until am and they were a little rude as well    the waitress came up to me before we even had our food and said quotI need your credit card nowquot and I replied quotCould I at least see the bill firstquot     strangeDefinitely avoid the night parking unless you like the convenience of the valet  We paid night at the Millennium parking complex about two blocks south of the hotel   saved us  for our three nightsThat grocery store right behind the hotel is awesome   Bockwinkels    Great location    hop out the door and walk a block to Michigan Ave    just four blocks from the El station which was also nice    well definitely be back to the Hyatt 
N => Enjoyable experience We got a great rate from Priceline so the high cost of valet parking  didnt sting as much  We had two adjoining rooms to accomodate family  Not the best view we looked out at an office building but since we were there over a weekend the building was empty of workers two of the three days we stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago  The hotel location was great  We walked to MIllineum Park and the river was just a step away so we could take a boat to Navy Pier for a very reasonable rate  Check in was quick concierage service was helpful never had a problem with the elevators  During check out time the elevators were fuller but nothing to complain about  When we did have to call for our vehicle we were always asked if we needed directions  Previous reviews warned use about the air conditioning and the mini bar  The air conditioner temp had to be set very low to make the room feel comfortable  The tag on the doors of the mini bar warn you that you will be charged based on weight of the items  If something is moved you will be charged and the rates are incredibly steep  We were traveling with an inquisitive three year old so we blocked both doors in each room with luggage so nothing could be accessed  We could have paid extra for a fridge to use during our stay but used a cooler instead  Ice was available on each floor  The beds and pillows were very comfortable  During our stay our room was cleaned daily and the hallways were cleaned and vacuumed regularly  We had to call for extra towels and the response was quick  We had help getting our bags to our room and when we checked out we were offered assistance several times  Only complaint is the lack of a pool but we knew that going in  Having an in room safe free of charge was a plus  Overall all our stay was terrific and would definitely stay again  
N => Had a great time We stayed here becasue of a conference my husband was attending  Loved the location while he was in meetings I went the tourist route  I was able to walk to Michigan Ave for shopping although I took a cab back to the hotel  Cabs were plentiful and reasonable the concereige service was very good  I reserved boat tour tickets through the hotel seemed to get directions everyday  The lobby restaurant was good with huge portions but over priced  There were plenty of good restaurants in the area so we only went there once  Our room was spacious and the staff was nice I forget a few things and they readily supplied them First hotel Ive been in in awhile that also provided travel toothpaste along with the standard shampoo condition and lotion  There was a card in the bathroom saying guests needed to request fresh linens but we got fresh towels daily anyway without asking  
N => GREAT location We scored a GREAT rate on Priceline com  Excellant location   close to everythingCheck in was a breeze  Room was nice could use more drawers  If we had been paying full price we would have expected MUCH more  FYINo shuttle service tofrom anywhereNo poolNo one offered to carry in our bags and we had quite a fewNo free internet connectionNo free access to in room safeMini bar takes up ENTIRE in room fridge so bring a cooler for leftovers and drinksNo watersoda machines on floor   just iceRoom service dishes and trash in hallways throughout the stay   housekeeping needs to make rounds more oftenNo fan in bathroomsHousekeeping did not leave enough towels soaps or glassescups for family of fourConcierge was out of City Pass tickets and did not have info regarding busses   would have saved us a TON of time waiting in line at venue to purchase  
N => Good Experience at the Hyatt Regency We were very pleased with our experience at the Hyatt Regency  We booked the stay through Priceline with the help of www biddingfortravel com  We paid  per night  For that rate I would have let fleas play shuffleboard on my shins but the hotel was great  The front desk staff Trinity and concierge John were very polite and helpful  We were in a corner room and heard nothing but normal hotel sounds  The room was clean and well maintained throughout our stay  This was not the fanciest hotel in the world but it was just fine for a large urban hotel  
N => NEVER AGAIN Absolutely the pits  Just awful  Do not even consider  It was a complete nighte and a terrible waste of money  I have received  times better customer service from walt greeters  All of the staff are stuck up slow to help and refuse to resolve complaintsproblems My boyfriend and I wished we would have stayed at the comfort inn  
N => Fantastic Staff The helpful staff made our stay pleasant  Our room was not ready at the requested but not promised pm check in or at pm we had left the hotel but I was expecting cellular notification or at pm when we returned to the hotel  When we arrived at pm a Customer Service rep took us in hand and was helpful  The same was true at pm  The hotel was fully booked  They did produce a room not on a Regency Club floor but one of the few rooms with a full unobstructed Lake MichiganNavy Pier view looking down East Wacker Drive  House keeping could not have been better  The included breakfast AAA rate was one of best breakfast bufets anywhere       included made to order omelets Eggs Benedict really good pancakes      The rooms and bathrooms are dated and could stand a remodel  They are ent sized  Ours was a standard double with two double beds three chairs and a flat screen tv Only four stars due to the dated and quotdown at the heelsquot appearance  In every other respect this big convention hotel deserves five stars  
N => disappointed booked ior suite  weeks in advance and called ahead to have suite with a view of river to make engagement more sentimental   assured this would be done but was greatly disappointed and offered only a business suite with no view or small regular room with a view next to service elevator   thanks for nothing and making my once in a lifetime evening a little less special   i think another hotel would have definitely been more helpful and accomodating   the staff didnt seem too concerned about helping me definitely not the Ritz  
N => Surprisingly Impressed The room was booked through a discount Web site at a very good price Upon check in there was a guest complaining to the manager about her experience  I thought is this going to be the beginning of MY experience It was not The service was fine I requested additional coffee packs and they came quickly and plentiful  The room was clean and updated  Funny they updated the bath but kept the old tub and tile surround  It was still clean Great location by the river and very close to Millennium Park  They do have a hr  fitness center but I did not use it I would say the best was the room I had a corner room that I enjoyed  The least The large  dated  lobby with many guests  It was loud and airport like  
N => Nighte on Wacker Dr I booked  rooms in this hotel because I got a very good rate to want seemed to be a very nice hotel  The full amount was charged to my credit card about  days prior to arrival althought there was no indication on the reservation that it was a prepaid rate  I thought of calling but since it was a vacation trip and I would have to pay for it anyway I did not call  Got to the check in counter at about PM on a Tuesday and after a couple of minutes of quotI have to check somethingquot I was told that they were overbooked and they would send me to another hotel for the night and give me my rooms the following day  Of course I did not accept that arrangement specially since they had already charged me for the rooms  After about half an hour of discussion asking for the manager which very conveniently the clerck told me she was the manager they would simply not give me any rooms so I relented and asked where would the put me for the night only to be told that they would send me to the Hyatt in OHARE What There must be some crazy manager running that place  I vehemently oppsosed and told them I would not go anywhere until they gave me my rooms that were already paid for  After some  more minutes of talking quotin the backquot they ided to give me one room with  full beds for  adults  Im quot and my son is   I dont know how they expected us to fit in there  I finally arranged for the kids both  to sleep over at a relatives living room  They also offered free internet during my stay never happened and a  credit towards food or drinks in the hotel never happened either  At AM the next morning I was at the counter to get my  rooms and I was told that if someone checked out they would let me know   what I took a deep breath and went up to the regency club I had reserved regency club rooms for some coffee only that the key card would not allow me in  Went down again and another lady told me this time that they would give me  rooms on the east tower not regency club so I felt a little better  She changed my key and I got access to the regency club  After we got back to the hotel the gave us our rooms one of which was a suite the other a regular dbl bedroom  I will not exagerate when I tell you that I went through at least  different key cards  The would re program them but they would not work so they ended up sending security up with me to see if I didnt know how to open the door I guess  And when they also couldnt they would let me in te room  After they finally got it working for one room only for the other it never worked the kids had to enter through my room then it would not work for the regency club and so the cycle began all over again The rooms are nothing special not even the suite  It was big but thats about it  If you plan to be on vacation and sleep late forget it  The hallways are so loud that you wont go to sleep early or sleep in late  You will hear absolutely everything happening in the hallways including the housekeeping calls at AM in every single room that does not have a privacy sign on it  The slit under the doors is so huge that you have to block the from your sight if light bothers you  I can go on about the rooms because a lot of things werent up to par but I think you get the picture On checkout I was charged  more per night on the dbl bedroom  When I requested they fix it I had my original reservation with me they came up quotin the back roomquot with the excuse that it was for the suite upgrade although I knew and they knew that it was not the case  Already tired of fighting with them I let it go  But I for one am not ever setting foot there again and will think twice about setting foot on a Hyatt ever again unless it is absolutely necessary  I also plan to find how to get through Hyatt management to let them know about this  
N => Oh dear     some work needed here Spent  nights at the Hyatt Regency in early y for my step dhters wedding  This was a large event as we had about  rooms booked for our party  The room was pretty good a newly refurbished king and we had a view of the lake just about  There was not sufficient storage space though we were a parking lot for some of the wedding paraphernalia but even so there was not a huge amount of storage space  I did like the desk situated behind the bed though  The service was generally appalling We had arranged a party in the Big Bar and whilst the service was okay during the event the planning of it was usually a battlefield of negativity from the staff as we were not prepared to spend enough The charges for everything were unbelievable I became convinced we would be charged for breathing too hardOnce our event concluded the staff returned to a quotdont carequot attitude  We requested a late checkout but I was convinced that our room keys would refuse to work at the standard checkout time and sure enough we were locked out of our rooms with still another  hrs before our extended checkout time  No communication between the front desk staff  The elevators are terrible in the morning  You will become acquainted with every floor on the way down to the lobby  When youre on the  something floor this becomes tedious very quickly  It can take mins to make it down to the lobby The air conditioning in our room failed after the second night and although this was reported nothing was done during our stay  It became nearly unbearable in our room especially at night  It was supposed to be some new quotgreenquot tech but it largely seemed to be a waste of time  While we were there several events were taking place and even though we were quite high up it was still very noisy with guests roaming the corridors in the early hours of the morning bawling into cell phones or at each other  I would praise the fitness center its modern there is plenty of equipment and its well serviced   the only part of the hotel that is The only other thing they have going for them is the location right in the heart of downtown Chicago its pretty hard to beat but This is a hotel that seems to believe that its the Ritz however the reality is that its a barely average convention hotel  Someone needs to point this out to themA miserable experience and one that I wont repeat There have to be better hotels in Chicago 
N => Okay Rooms with Weird Layout This is my second stay at the Hyatt Regency  Last time we had two queen beds so the room was large  This time we had one king size bed which led us to have a weird room  The room itself was very small and the television was situated next to the right side of the bed so the left side had trouble seeing the tv  Next time well ask for two queen beds again just to have more space  Also the walls were thin which made it difficult to sleep when our neighbors were partying and playing music Check in was super fast  Staff was pleasant  Just remember that check in is on the second floor  The room was spotless  The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean  The bathrooms were spacious and hand nice amenities  The views werent bad even though we didnt upgrade to lake views  Theres also a grocery store around the corner from the hotel so you can save some cash on dining in the hotel restaurants which are a bit pricey  
N => Absolutely Horrible This place is busy and chaotic  After a lengthy check in ordeal we waited in line  minutes to ride the elevator to the th floor  We opened the door to find that the room was already occupied  We went back downstairs for another lengthy ordeal and then had to wait another  minutes to take the elevator to our new unoccupied room  The air conditioning did not work  The one vent just blows air up towards the ceiling near the window  It was very hot and humid in the room  Maintenance came and said it was fixed but it was not  The ironing board was broken  Parking costs  per day  The only redeeming quality of this beastly place is the location  
N => Disappointing be we just got the worst room in the hotel but our stay was awful  The climate control was terrible   our room was constantly stuffy humid and warm until we finally turned the thermostat down to  which made it too cold but at least a little less humid  The coffee maker broke on the first day when we asked for a new one they delivered one and left it in the box on the dresser  They didnt open the box unpack it set it up or take away the old one we had to do all that  Trash was left lying outside our room for over  hours even though the maid had cleaned the room in the meantime  There wasnt enough storage only two small drawers  And the room was incredibly noisy   water noise from surrounding bathrooms woke us up every night  I wouldnt stay here again  
N => Dont Bother The Concierge was very helpful w tickets to Shedd Aquarium but only sold adult tix not childrens  Elevators were rather slow but after fireworks on the rd they opened up service elevators with employees directing folks where to go so that was helpful  The room was ok but the toilet was commercial looking and the bathroom was kind of outdated  The bed was ok comfort but Ive had better I had to call security two nights in a row bc of teens running singing yelling etc  in the halls at  am  Unacceptable for the type and price of hotel Location is ok but not near many restaurants  It was very helpful that there is a grocery store right outside the hotel  My husband couldnt get internet on his I Touch unless he went downstairs  
N => Excellent Customer Service On a recent trip to Chicago I left my purse in a cab in route from the airport to the Hyatt Regency Hotel  I am truly grateful to the staff of the hotel for all their help in tracking down my bag  Everyone from the manager to customer service to the security personnel were truly above and beyond what I had ever experienced in a hotel staff  I was treated as if my personal problem was a top priority of the entire hotel staff  Luckily my bag was recovered and I will always be thankful to the help of the staff of the Hyatt Regency Chicago  
N => Our first visit to Chicago with friends the hotel was just fine thank you  After reading some less than stellar reviews about this hoetl I was a bit concerned about this hotel  But we got a great deal bidding through Priceline so that offset my concerns  My wife and I went for a long weekend at the end of e along with another couple our good friends  The hotel exceeded our expectations  We arrived at noon on Friday well before the  check in time  We both asked for a river view on the same floor  They advised that we would have to wait a few hours to get it which we happily agreed to do  They stored our luggage and we went out for lunch at O Briens Riverwalk Caf  on the river front  Good burgers and beer  We walked around some then when we returned to the Hyatt about  we were both assigned  rooms on the th floor with wonderful views of the Chicago River  Our only minor issue with our room was that we were in a lock out room and a few times in the early evening we could hear our neighbors talking  But we never heard them at night  Our king size bed was very comfortable   Restaurants we liked  O Briens Riverwalk Caf    great lunch fare and beer on the Chicago River   Corner Bakery Cafe a block from the hotel on Wacker Drive   we ate breakfast there  mornings in a row  Great reasonable food good coffee and friendly service    La Luce   Wonderful and reasonable Italian  This was a referral and it didnt dissapoint  In an old building awasy from the downtown area near the United Center  Try their lasagna and their eggplant parmesian    Catch Thirty Five    W Wacker Dr   Great seafood in a pretty restaurant  
N => Excellent customer service The hotel was full but not once did any of the staff appear to be too busy to assist our group with our requests  We attended a program about customer service the Hyatt staff were great examples  For a business trip the location the conference rooms restaurants bar etc  were great  Downsides were charge for internet service if accessed from your room high parking costs and no pool  
N => Has No Idea What Cust  Service Is Customer service can make or break a hotel  Many things can be overlooked if the staff is helpful courteous and knowledgeable  And when the customer service is bad it makes everything else sour in comparison  My recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago feels like a disaster  When we first arrived we had paperwork stating that we had pre paid  Our card had been run  days prior to our stay when we booked it and the hotel had conveniently forgotten this when we checked in  They assured us that we would not be double billed and demanded we give them our card again  So we spent the whole trip worried that a rather large charge we were staying many nights would end up charging twice to our card  We were also given a discount on valet through AAA the hotel at first knew about it then had no idea then knew again then ended up charging us the full rate  The final straw on this camels back was that our brand new car was damaged in excess of  by the valet who backed the car right into a pole and attempted to cover it up  
N => oversold again As noted by many others this hotel has a terrible problem with overbooking  This is the third time in  years I have had a guaranteed reservation not honored because the hotel was overbooked  Several of the hotel employees on multiple trips over the years have acknowledged to me that this hotel has a problem with overbooking  To make things worse this hotel is very aggressive about enforcing its one night penalty policy for customers who do not keep their reservation  They do this even when they are oversold and they would have not been able to honor the reservation if you had shown up  As some reviews note there are a number of nice features to this hotel but they are all overshadowed by the ridiculous amount of overbooking which is at a level to be an unethical business practice MEETING PLANNERS BEWARE MEMBERS OF YOUR GROUP WILL BE DISAPPOINTED  THIS HOTEL DOES ITS WORST OVERBOOKING DURING CONVENTIONS If you are planning to arrive at the hotel late be warned that your likelihood of being denied your room is very high  Checking in ahead of time will NOT protect you  
N => Great stay wonderful My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of    She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city  We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos  night stay for night plus we got the full buffet breakfast The room was wonderful  Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area  We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move  The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows  No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit poor taps  We could have upgraded to river view for night but chose not to  We enjoyed the room for what it was  nd floor looking south The buffet breakfast was great  Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please  Great to have breakfast included in night stay  Might be a bit dear to pay at person  It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat always informative and ready to provide maps directions multiple suggestions and even make the reservations  Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs Location was great  Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river If in Chicago again would not hesitate to stay here again A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it  
N => Very over priced eating places over priced  room airconditioner did not work even after service tried to fix it  Location in good  parking charges very high also internet very pricey  Staff was friendly and helpful  Very little space for your clothes to be stored only two drawers to put your clothes away 
N => Only good if you get a great price  We got this hotel for  a night on priceline  With that in mind it was pretty good  We asked for a view at check in and told us that would cost an extra  a night we said no thanks  Then they asked if we minded a handicap room to get a view and we accepted  Great viewHotel location  Excellent The room seems pretty standard upon inspection  Big flat screen TV but doesnt have HD channels  Linens Ok Bathroom not so great  Yes granite tile the grout around the tub in the shower were sort of gross  The bathroom has no ventilation fan and the ceiling tiles had stains on them The room was satisfactory at the price but we would have been severely disappointed if we had to pay  a night which was the Hyatts price  
N => Typical for a Hyatt   no surprises  I was here for a conference and delighted with the Hyatt for the facilities  One problem was that the staff could not direct us to the location of the conference due to the fact that they had not received the next days schedule we needed to set up as the conference started at  the next morning   in this day and age this should be something pretty easy to resolve    especially from a hotel that specializes in conferences  Othe rthan this which was a mild inconvenience the stay was great  
N => Nice clean convenient Huge busy downtown hotel that is a hopping place  Clean double bed room  Rather standard but no problems  Everything in good working order  Bathrooms are especially pretty  Walking to Museum Mag Mile too far  Buffet brunch is fabulous  And their upstairs bar appeared to be a fun happening spot  Staff all over hotel very professional  Wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
N => Great Location Friendly Service and spacious room Great Location   walking distance to Magnificent Mile Millennium Park Art Institute State Street stores  Friendly staff   when we got to the hotel we were readily directed to the reception area for check in  Check in was a breeze Our room was spacious and clean  
N => Great Stay and Thank You Travelzoo To start with I would like to put a disclaimer that we paid night from a special with Travelzoo that included breakfast vouchers for myself and my wife so a lot of my opinions are based on that We arrived on Tuesday afternoon around  and checked in very quickly  My first impression was that I found the hotel to be huge but it was pretty empty  I liked the atrium design with the waterfalls and the garden  The room itself was very good size  We had a king size bed and more then ample room to stretch out  There was even a fridge which we could use to store out water and beers We asked the concierge for assistance in getting tickets to The Blue Man Group and they ended up finding us   off tickets through Hot Tix which was a great score  In general they were very helpful My only one negative comment would be the Housekeeping  One day they did not clean our room even though we clearly had the Clean Our Room sign on the door  However that was manageable if we got a couple of bath towels  So I called down to Housekeeping and they stated they would send them up  We had dinner reservations which is why there was a little more urgency in obtaining the towels  I ended up having to call  times and waited  minutes before they finally arrived  It wasnt the end of the world but it did put me off for awhile Overall I loved the location of this hotel and the friendliness of the staff we encountered  We had breakfast in the restaurant  of  days and found very good  For the price we paid this was an absolute steal of a deal  If we paid twice as much I would still say its a great hotel and I definitely recommend it to anyone  If I had to pay x as much then I would say it  be a little to pricey  
N => Great stay My husband and I went to Chicago for meetings with his company  The Hyatt was great and had a wonderful staff  I enjoyed my trip and would go back again  I was not crazy about the view but this is by the airport  Our room was at the end so we were not disturbed by other guest in the hall  Our hostess in the Regency Club was fantastic  Wish it had an indoor pool  
N => cant complain but cant write home about it either Pros service was amazing Traveled with some colleagues and we checked in at different times but they managed to get us in rooms fairly close together  Location was great close to everything that we needed Cons rooms were nothing special  They were clean and my room was spacious but fairly standard If I hadnt booked through Priceline and gotten a fantastic rate I think I would have been disappointed but given the rate I paid I was very happy  
N => Guest services not to expectations Hotels staff was friendly  Iron in the room was not working and upon multiple requests staff at the front desk did not replace it and eventually in the morning I call guest services who then took care of it  I was very disappointed with this quality of service from a hotel of this class and reputation  Guest services did not even offer to compensate for the inconvenience caused and did not even follow up on what actually caused the delay in replacing the ironshe did apologize to begin with for the inconvenience and said would try to find out what caused the delay  Overall we were satisfied and happy with our stay  
N => Good location Bad quality room We stayed at Hyatt Regency during Mothers day weekend with family  We had  rooms and the room was smelling like smoke rooms were clean  Bed was horrible mattress was probably old  we asked for king size bed and surprised to a twin bed on all our rooms  These were supposed to be all non smoking but we smelled second hand smoke as if rooms were converted  I dont recommend staying the west wing  
N => Didnt want to leave Stayed in a ior Suite which was beautiful and spacious  It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel great excuse to catch up on some movies The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice  The service was top notch  Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty  The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing  Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city  
N => Great place to stay as long as you dont book directly This Hyatt met the standards the chain sets out  It is a very nice hotel with comfy beds and big flat screen TVs  I stayed two nights and couldnt find anything to complain about at all  I would have liked free Wifi but  star hotels always seem to charge for it  The subwayelevated trains are only about three blocks away and the area seems safe even late at night  I easily walked to Navy Pier from the hotel and the convenient public transit can get you to any other place in town  If you ide youd like to stay here though be sure to use a third party like Priceline where I got a rate about half the rate on the Hyatt website  Or try your negotiating skills when calling the hotel directly to book 
N => Great experience We stayed at the Hyatt for one night   We arrived late at  and were exhausted from the  hour drive from Detroit The check in guy Aladin was very helpful  He upgraded us to a Regency Club floor that included a free breakfast  You needed a special key to get to that floor  There was a beautiful lobby and a huge gorgeous tini lounge I think called the Big Bar  We were planning on going to our room changing and showering then going to the bar in the lobby for a drink  As soon as I laid on that bed I was out  It was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on  Me and my fiance ended up falling asleep and not waking up til  am the next morning We woke up and had the breakfast that was exclusive for Regency Club guests only and it was divine  Everything was fresh and it definitely was not your typical continental breakfast  They had pepsi in glass bottles which I absolutely love and the staff was extremely nice  We left the hotel and I was sad to leave because it was such a nice hotel  The walls were very thin you couldn t hear people talk but you could hear other rooms when they flushed the toilet or put the shower on  Also they didnt have a pool or hot tub which i was looking forward to  But that bed made up for anything that the hotel  have lacked  
N => Great Hotel for the price and location My Boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel right before Christmas and it was a good experience Parking was underground and of coarse you had to pay a little extra for it  On our last day they even let us keep the car down there because we werent done sightseeing yetWe didnt eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel but we did have a drink at the bar That night that we went a company was having thier Christmas party and the whole place was busy  We were happy to even found a seat but we did and service was excellent  They came and waited on us right away  Which was nice since it was soo busy Overall the rooms were nice we had nothing to complain about them  Just dont open the minibar if your not going to have anything  Its case sensitive  I opened it anyways because I wanted to see what was in it but they never billed me for anything which is good The Hotel is in the perfect spot for everything shopping is close by we hardly took a cab and it was in the middle of Winter there Overall our experience was great if we were to stay in Chicago again we would def stay there again because of the spot the hotel is located in  The deal we got on the Hotel was great so no complaints from us 
N => Not at all what we were expecting This hotel cuts corners  Checking in and out is a breeze with a great wait staff  The concierges were very helpful and knowledgeable with great tips from attractions to food  I was able to book the ior suite for  with a coupon found on www travelzoo com which included two free buffet breakfasts  value each  The room was not as promising as it seemed via hotel research  The shower in the bathroom had drainage problems and flooded our floor  The ceiling had also been replaced which brings me to the conclusion that this wasnt just a problem in our room  To add to this the craftsmanship of the replaced ceiling was not to hotel standard seeing as it was a giant piece of drywall screwed into the top with the edges left visible  The vanity mirror looked as if it had once been ripped out of the wall and then screwed in above its original spot seeing as there were several screws and holes below it that were painted over The Hyatt Grand Bed was rock hard  The couch felt like it had been purchased from the clearance rack at Ikea  The hallway carpet needs to be revamped  Internet was   tax per night Outside of the room and wait staff the hotel bar quotThe Big Barquot was at mediocre at best  They serve oz tinis and oz beer towers which sound intriguing but expect to wait an hour literally to be served  Drinks were overpriced which is to be expected for a hotel bar but youd think that theyd have a wait staff that cared enough to come to your table instead of gossiping with others  After stating our case to the waitress we were giving a free tower and more free breakfast vouchers  This set us a ease for the night but still the wait was not acceptable In all I will not be staying at this hotel ever again  If you for some reason want to chance it go on priceline and bid  for your room  be then it will be worth it  
N => We were expecting better Correct me if Im wrong but isnt Hyatt HQ in Chicago In any case I went on a weekend       shopping getaway with my mother Im in my mid s shes in her mid s  We thought the location was indeed superb  Cab rides to Navy Pier or the Magnificent Mile cost us under  bucks and we walked when it wasnt too cold  The first room we got had a partial view of the lake up on the st floor but it was moldy and my mother couldnt handle it  The staff was very accomodating and moved us to another room  The next room was better in regards to smell and view but as I sat my purse down I noticed that the coffee table was filthy  It looked like someone spilled something on it and they only cleaned the glass so underneath the glass the residue was caked on   so gross  As far as the bathroom aesthetically speaking upon first glance it was nice  Upon closer inspection the countervanity although blegranite was stained and so was the floor  The SINK oh goodness   washing our faces and brushing our teeth was an experience  The drain did not allow the water to go down properly so there was always residue   icky  Regarding the bed linen   I found a stain  Oh and the remote for the tv was sooooooo dirty  One more thing for some reason it looked like the door had been forced open  It had evidence of forcible entry  I dont know what that was about but I thought Id add it to my comentary  Theres more but my mother isnt around to speak on her observations  Wait wait wait   how could I forget the paper thin walls  I heard everything outside and the tvconversations of the room beside us and everytime their toilet flush  WOW  The beds were pretty comfy  One thing we found strange was that I had a nice warm duvet while my mother had a regular blacket on her bed  Overall though stay was fine  I would not give this place a four star rating  There might been other rooms that deserve the  stars but certainly not ours  There needs to be greater detail payed to cleaning the rooms  Seriously people have to live in these rooms for a period of time so they need to be sanitary  house keeping can help tremendously in that area  Other than my issue with the cleanliness which concerns the HK I think the staff was very nice helpful and efficient  I cant say anything bad about them  About Hyatt corporate however I will say this   please please please invest some money into the adequate upkeep of this place  I know everyone is facing financial hardships but you have a reputation to maintain  Honestly I dont think I would stay here again  I typically dont like to complain but when my hard earned money is being spent especially in recessionary times I dont like the feeling of being taken for granted  Please ignore any spelling or grammatical error  Thanks  
N => It was awesome I booked this hotel through priceline  I was hoping to get the Intercontinental so from the get go I was not that happy  After reading the reviews on here I was nervous as well I got the hotel for  a night so in that aspect I was happy The hotel was very impressive  It was big and the lobby was nice  It was one of the nicer hotels we have stayed at and we have stayed at manyThey bumped our room up so we had a view of the frozen Michigan River which was nice We visited the Big Bar which had delicious big drinks and the food was really great a touch on the pricey side but worth itThe hotel is in a great location Walking distance from a lot of sightseeing  I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel  The negatives would be the parking but we stayed during the weekend and managed to park at a meter which is free on Sundays  All in all the walls are a little thin but we had a corner room so it was not that bad  The staff was very nice and helpful  I was impressed with the computers at the concierge which are able to print your boarding passes  That was a nice treat  Also they have really good Starbucks hot cocoa for a good price as well Enjoy your stay You really will be happy with the end result 
N => Perfect Stay I had booked the room through name your own price Priceline and got an awesome deal  I know the economy is down but this deal was a great one  I called after I made the reservation and requested a King room  Because on Priceline you really don t know what your getting  You just know you got the room  Check in was smooth and the staff was very friendly  We got the King room we had requested  It was room   The room was located on the end so we had no problem with noise  Some people are commenting on the walls being paper thin  We heard no additional outside noise  The room was great  No complaints at all  Valet is  dollars a day but there is a parking garage right next to the hotel which has the standard  dollars for  to  hours as im sure that is where your car is going anyway if you use the hotel  Taxi service was great we had no problems getting one  Once we got back to the hotel after our evening out we went to the BIG BAR  It was crowded but we found a table no problem  Service there was good as well Server was very friendly  As far as drinks being expensive as some people have noted  It s a hotel in the middle of downtown Chicago  You re not at the Holiday Inn in Madison Wisconsin people  Once back to the room we ordered some room service and it also came in a timely manner and was very good  When it came time to check out the staff was great  Quick and efficient  I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again  
N => Great Location   Paper Thin Walls I was looking for a hotel close to Michigan Avenue that was around   I was able to get a  rate through the Hyatt web site  The Big Bar was cool but the drinks were very expensive  I guess you are paying for the view  Our room was orated nicely and clean but the walls are paper thin  I could hear conversations clearly outside our room  I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful  Especially the concierge  If I had remembered my earplugs I would have given this hotel an above average rating  All in all the hotel was worth the  per night  One plus is the free trolley stops outside the hotel  
N => Good hotel if you get a good rate Got a great price through a convention rate however when you do that be prepared for a total mob scene The taxi line downstairs looked like the ones you see at the airport YIKESHotel was fully booked so only had  double beds despite my king bed reservation  Again when you have a big hotel like this that is packed be prepared to wait for alot of things elevators coffee etc    Room was nice great mega flat screen tv but no HD  Bathrooms need a bit updating but not bad however be warned the shower pressure is TERRIBLE packed large hotel usually equates to bad water pressure For the  it was a great value would not pay more than other comparable hotels in the area as I dont think you need to  
N => location was super Very fun stay in Chicago  Stayed on rd floor of hotel directly across from fire station  We were impressed with windows  At first we thought quothope they dont get a callquot  They did get a call in the night though we did not hear it Check in and check out were very smooth with self check units  We didnt have to wait in line  Bell staff was polite and helpful  Housekeeping was friendly and room was clean  Carpeting was beyond repair in two spots  That should have been replaced  Other than that we liked our room Big Bar was fun  Italian restaurant was awful tasting and over priced  Js quot hourquot snacks was closed at  a m  when we were hungry  That was a bummer In general we were happy with our stay  There were lots of great places to eat outside of the hotel  
N => Okay I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago and our stay at the Hyatt was just ok after three arate rooms Our first impression of the hotel was that it was extremely busy  My wife likened the lobby to an airport and I think that was a good comparison  There are people waiting on lines everywhere for the front desk the concierge the coffee bar etc We arrived a bit early and checked in  Unfortunately our room was not ready but the person behind the desk said that we were going to be put in a room with a lake view  Within a half hour they called me to say the room was ready but we did not come back to the hotel until mid afternoon  We assumed that a room was reserved for us but unfortunately there were no lake view rooms left We were given three different rooms one with a view of the lobby one which backed on to the service elevator shaft and was very loud and a suite with the same elevator problem  Luckily the service elevators dont run at night We ended up staying in the suite they gave us which was large and had a nice sitting area and wet bar  Although listening to the elevator woosh by every minute or two was very annoying The layout is very strange and it looks like the building was converted to a hotel at some time  Our large suite had only a stall shower and the closet was in the bathroom The location was great though  It was right on the river and near the Miracle Mile Main tip MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM IS NOWHERE NEAR THE SERVICE OR PASSENGER ELEVATORS  
N => Unnecessarily unaccomodating I have had a stressful experience at this hotel  I booked this through a conference for what I thought was the st to the th only to find out that my reservation was made for the th to the th possibly my fault possibly booking error  When I arrived from my flight I found out that my entire reservation had been cancelled without a phone call and so I was charged both the room cancellation fee and had no place to stay  They were kind enough to allow me to stay one additional night but explained that they were overbooked and so I might not get a hotel room tommorow  In fact they were not overbooked as I can book one of several rooms at a higher rate on their website  when I went back downstairs for clarification I came to understand that in fact they are overbooked for our group not for the hotel  It bewilders me that they can not provide the courtesy at  a night of extending my stay  nights when they have capacity PARTICULARLY to a customer that had originally booked those two nights  The front desk staff and guest services are courteous which I appreciate  
N => Never again I stayed at the hotel as part of a conference  My room was somewhat clean however shortly after check in the smell of smoke began to come from the hallway  I was on a non smoking floor  I contacted the front desk and was told they would have security deal with it  It was late so I went to bed  The next morning again smoke was in the hallway from another room  I contacted the front desk and they again said it would be deat with  That night again there was smoke I asked to be moved to another room and was told they were booked solid and that was not an option  I asked if they could do something about the room that was smoking on a non smoking floor and was told they would be charged for cleaning but they do not stop people from smoking  On my final night they offered a room change when I got the new room it was a king bed instead of the two doubles I had previously had  I contacted the front desk and they said I could have the king or move back to my other room  Overall the property is worn and in need of a good cleaning  Location is good but rooms were noisy  
N => Solid choice if not sensitive to noise For a huge hotel the Hyatt did surprisingly well with elements under the staffs control  Check in at pm on a Friday in the busiest lobby weve ever seen was quick and efficient although a long wait for an elevator  Our initial King room at the end of a hallway was strangely shaped like a squished trapezoid with the bed squeezed in at an odd angle  Were not terribly picky but it was not a happy space or a relaxing room  Since we booked through Priceline I wasnt sure wed be able to switch but a call to the front desk offered a new room on the same floor this one with two double beds but with the caveat that they had no bellman to move us  A trip down and back up landed us a room across from a very loud malfunctioning ice machine    but the rooms size muted the noise and we had a Priceline rate so we knew we were not going to get a choice room We are sound sleepers so the noise wasnt a big deal but man it was LOUD especially with the late night tipplers staggering back to their rooms in the wee hours  If the Hyatt can afford quot plasma TVs surely they could afford a quot strip at the bottom of the door to block some of the noise that comes through the large space between bottom of door and floor Our room was standard Hyatt or pretty yet it had clearly had seen a lot of traffic  We were greeted by name in every phone call and desk encounter and a room service clerk was especially courteous and observed all standard gender protocol requesting permission to enter the room opening the deadbolt so the door did not fully closelatch when he was in the room when the female member of our couple ordered room service alone in the room one evening  Some  think this old fashioned but it was appreciated We expect expensive room service but at  for a veggie wrap and a soda it was disappointing the sandwich was tough and unpleasant and did not taste fresh  Weve typically had much higher quality room service meals at other Hyatts The Fitness Center is located inconveniently in a tunnel connecting the two wings of the buildings in a passageway it shares with an Indian restaurant  The hallway outside the fitness center reeked of cigar smoke to the extent that we didnt bother going in That said the location was perfect the weather was beautiful and really when we werent in the massive quotairportquot lobby it wasnt a bad stay  Not something we would recommend at full price but a very solid choice if you can get a deal  We would definitely stay here again  
N => You can do much better There is nothing wrong with this hotel but there also nothing special  My first impression was that it reminded me of a somewhat worn large airport lobby full of many people  In fact I think that is what the hotel is trying to achieve  They even have self serve check in terminals and flashing lights indicating what wing you re to use to get to your room  If you are lucky you will get a room in the west wing high up so that you have a nice lake and river view  If you are not lucky you could end up facing a dirty old apartment building For the most part my stay at the hotel was okay  I had trouble sleeping because of loud noises from the icemakers and other people using water  I was not expecting anything special and I was right not to  We stayed the last two nights of our visit to Chicago at this hotel to lower the average of cost we spent on hotels for this visit  We found a great rate on Hotwire for this hotel under a hundred dollars  However even with the great price we got on this hotel I would not stay here again  There are just too many more hotels in Chicago that have so much more character than this hotel  If you don t care about character or charm than you might be okay with this hotel but I think you can do better even at a great rate  
N => Boy did I pick the WRONG Hyatt in Chicago Bad customer service mediocre food in restaurants and loud sums it up  This is a huge hotel  When I checked in rooms came and went before I could answer the questions about quotupgradesquot  They said that I could have a complimentary upgrade to a suite  When I found it it was one floor above the street I knew it was a problem  When I went into the room all I could hear was the ice machine outside the door rumbling  Then someone used it and it really made noise  I asked to be moved because of the ice machine and street noise  I lugged my luggage back to the lobby across the hotel to the other tower to my new upgraded room on the quiet quotclubquot level  They left out the part that club amenities were extra which I can understand but at least inform the customer when you are playing up the quotclub levelquot part  This upgraded room was missing a remote control for the tv no pen on the desk no paper  Since I heard turn down service going from door to door I waited patiently and then realized quotno turn down servicequot for us upgraded people  So I had to call the desk to bring these items Then I heard room service pounding on someones door at am  I have gotten room service that late myself but they are usually quiet about it as some people might be sleeping but not in this hotelAbout a half hour later all hell broke loose on the quotquiet club floorquot  When I called the desk they said they would send security  I told them it was security making all the noise yelling in the hall at  am  I never heard anyone but security and their radios turned way up making noise The next day the manager asked what he could do to make it up to me  I said that club level amenities would be nice and he seemed to agree  You guessed it   never got anythingThe food in the hotel restaurants was also mediocre as was the service I wouldnt stay there again if I were paid to do so  Several of my friends had problems as well but they can write their own posts  
N => Overall very good hotel I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a convention  The convention rate which was not paid by me was a great rate of   I had stayed for the same convention  years ago  AT that time the hotel was much prettier had a grand piano playing in the atrium  The hotel was impressive  The people working there could not have been more helpful  I do not feel the concierge always guided us correctly with restaurants however  On a Sunday she gave us the name of a restaurant that is closed on Sundays  The assistant manager helped us with airline troubles and let everyone print out boarding passes  The room was very nice of course  I thought it should have come with a small refrigerator  There was a cooler of sorts with the normal treats you have to pay for  We were not interested in buying anything just wanted to put our water etc  in the cooler  It said every time you open the door you will be charged  dollars  So we did not put our water in the cooler  Had we been able to use the cooler we could have brought left overs to our room  With the money the Hyatt charges and considering most any even Days Inn you go to now has a little refrigerator the Hyatt should provide this  Most of the people in our group liked the bed  I found it very hard and it hurt my back  Other than this Id recommend the hotel  
N => An ok place to stay I just got back from a trip to the Chicago Hyatt Regency  We arrived on  and left on   Overall it was a nice hotel  We waited until  days before our trip to book our room so we ended up getting a room for a more reasonable rate  If you are planning on going there I would wait as long as possible to book your room  From our room we could hear noise from the elevators all night long  The only other complaint I have is that the parking is  per day which seemed very high  We had the problem that it took awhile for them to bring our car around  We needed to get our umbrella from our car and my husband waited  minutes for them to get it for us  We learned to call ahead for them to get our car ready when we wanted to leave  Overall the hotel was ok  I wouldnt have paid the full rate for the room though because to me it didnt seem that much fancier than a less expensive hotel  However the location was great for walking to the Art Institute Millennium Park and the Magnificent mile  
N => Not worth the money I just spent three days here on a quotgirlsquot trip and we were all disappointed since it was a special trip and we thought we were staying somewhere swanky  The queen beds turned out to be full size  Two coffee pods were available for the four of us and no coffee anywhere else to be found in the hotel we take our coffee very seriously and its such an easy amenity to provide  Zero extras like breakfast cocktail hour even apples or water on the front desk  Not enough towels for four  A  charge to even use the refrigerator apparently it is weight sensitive  The movie we rented was fuzzy  A dirty cup was left outside the door next to ours for almost two days the hallway carpet was stained and the ledge in our room had visible dust hanging off  I hate to point out cleaning flaws however since the maid and the valet were the only kind people we encountered in the entire hotel  The staff is indifferent at best  We valet parked for night but we were still expected to leave the hotel to get our car quotThe quickest way for you to get your car is to go across the street and down two escalators to ask them at the valet desk or you can give your ticket to someone at the door next doorquot is almost verbatim what we were told at the front desk when we asked if our car could be brought up while we fetched our bags  And no offer to help us with our bags from anyone at any point  They wouldnt even let us use a cart when we unloaded the car because it is a quotliabilityquot  even though we saw other people with carts I admit Im a bit biased at this point because Im in Chicago a lot and have had some really great experiences and to be fair one really really horrible one  This hotel is a dud  If you have any expectations for customer service or anything even remotely special there are much better places to stay including the Affinia Allegro and the Amalfi  
N => Convenient location Was booked in here for a  night stay in conction with a professional meeting  When I arrived after the  pm check in time I was told that my reserved king room was not ready and I was offered a room with a queen bed  Since I was alone I figured this would suit my purposes  Unfortunately the room was a corner room with weird furniture arrangement insufficient dresser space and a large screen t v  situated on the desk which made working difficult  I would not recommend accepting this type of room if offered  The hotel is huge and clearly serves a large business audience  However they appear to be able to accommodate well large crowds and elevators waits were not a problem  Room was comfortable and typical Hyatt or  The location is excellent being close to Michigan avenue and the Loop  I also took advantage of being close to the boat dock for the achitectural boat tour  minute ride  which was excellent concierge will book reservation  My only real complaint with the hotel other than the slight disadvantage of an odd room was that on my check out day the room service lady knocked on my door and let herself in at  to ask when I would be checking out  Fortunately I was dressed but it could have been awkward had I wanted to sleep in late  
N => Comfy bed terrible bathroom lighting My husband amp I stayed here for  nights while he was attending a conference in   Our room was on the th floor with a view of the river  The view would have been excellent except for the moisture in the windows which blurred the view  It was a nice room but not a  star room  I would give it   stars  The bed was very comfortable amp we did get a king room which my husband had requested  Also good fluffy pillows  However our bathroom seemed old  The lighting was very dim   not good for shaving or putting on makeup  I stopped by the front desk amp mentioned it to the girl on duty  She was very pleasant amp confirmed that a number of people had complained about the lights  We liked its location amp were able to walk to many places like the Art Institute of Chicago Millenium Park the Magnificent Mile etc  The one evening when my husband had a business dinner I walked to the Oriental Theatre by myself to see quotWickedquot which Id highly recommend  We used the concierge services  times amp received good service  The concierge desks are setup like podiums close to the main check in area  
N => Moody waiting staff We visited this hotel for lunch and I had to write a review because we were so disappointed  The  Restaurant at this Hotel simply had the most miserable and unhelopful wait staff that I have come across  Everythying was just too much trouble  The exception was Joanna the bar tender who went out of her way to help us I went to use the ladies and there was a homeless lady washing herself in the sink  Delightful Please dont visit this hotel if you want good service with a smile 
N => Nice rooms but ripoff beverage prices and parking fees The room was nicely remodeled with a plasma tv etc  The bathroom was smallish and had no exhaust fan of any kind making it a steambath when taking a shower  The toilet didnt flush properly  The large glass ceiling lobby restaurant and bar area was very pleasant except for the fact the air conditioning was not able to keep it cool  The bar area had to be pushing  degrees on a sunny day The drinks were the most overpriced I have ever encountered Total ripoff  The restaurant prices were not too bad if you order from the menu  The breakfast buffet was way overpriced for the quality offered  The hotel staff was nice  I rode Amtrak to Chicago to avoid the ripoff parking fees of nearly   a day  All in all I would think there are better hotels for the money in Chicago  
N => Nickeled and dimed to death A very pleasant hotel but sheesh the prices  a day to park a day to use the room safe   a day to use the internet   a day to use the mini fridge which I needed to keep meds coldExorbitant room service prices And so on and so on  
N => Great Location They were out of room so they offered me the State Suite that had a cot  I accepted the offer because they offered me a  food and beverage credit to do so  Though it was likely worth more than that since the cot was not that great  Big room but without the attached bedroom it was not as cool  
N => Mixed Reviews Was here for a  day conference and found the hotel common areas such as lobby not that appealling The Big Bar was kinda cool and a good place to people watch and hang out but restaurants were difficult to access and not that inviting  Thank goodness the rooms were pretty ent amp clean Great beds and flat screen TVs in some rooms  Close walk to Miracle Mile Shopping area good location if you like to shop Might see Michael Jordan having drinks there I did that was the highlight for me a big Bulls fan Chicago was great but make Im not sure if I would recommend this hotel RMA Hamilton Ontario Canada 
N => go to a  star youll be better off  star inconvinience  moldy bathroom walls haqir in the bathtub   parking pernight  for internet you pay min  dollars which gives you  min then you add another  dollars    it took them  min and  phonecalls to bring a toothpaste up to the room   bucks to get these does not leave you pleased  sorry 
N => not that great we spent  days at this hotel for a meeting  the location was ok but still a couple of blocks away from all the action  the whole complex is a little on the shabby side  chairs in the lobby had disconcerting stains on them  the room itself was just average and in need of paint and a makeover  toilets were of the type you find in a bus station not that ive ever been in a bus station the kind with a bar in back that you flush with your foot since youre scared to touch it ive NEVER seen that in an expensive hotel  and yes  it was expensive  we didnt have a flat screen tv when we checked in on wednesday but on thursday they installed one in our room and the rest of the floor  internet access was almost  a day  we ordered room service twice and it was delivered promptly even the breakfast we preordered for  am so we could catch our flight  all the service personnel we had dealings with were polite and helpful  they will not give you fresh towels or fresh sheets without request  they claim theyre trying to save the environment  i dont believe the room was vacuumed our entire stay  nothing greener than dirty carpet huh anyway i think there are much better quality and values for your money  we only stayed there because it was the venue of the seminar  any further meetings we have to attend at this hotel well stay elsewhere  
N => The real review will come in ober    Ok let me preface these comments by noting that I and I had my wife with me was at the Hyatt as part of a mid year board meeting for a professional organization  We have our meetings at the site of our upcoming ober annual conference  Therefore we were designated as quotVIPsquot which  mean that the overwhelmingly attentive customer service I received  not reflect the experience of the average guest  ober will tell the tale Im sure that we wont be VIP status since our group will number about  or so   well just be regular guests All the same I was really ambivalent about my stay based on the TA reviews I had read  My experiece was a good one  Our room was really nice  very comfortable bed and I enjoyed having an LCD TV to watch  We were on the th floor with wonderful view of the river the Hancock Tower etc  We thought the water pressure might be an issue given the way the sink flowed but the shower turned out to be just fine  Internet access was plenty fast but too pricey almost day   but I had it free for this visit Customer service was very good   but keep in mind the VIP thing  When they called to tell us our second room was ready we were given an adjoining suitelivingdining room wbar couches etc my wife went down to get the key  Because the reservation was made by my organization she wasnt listed    so they wouldnt give her the key  However the customer service agent in the lobby came up with her to verify that she was my wife  Everytime I called someone on the phone they used my name  So overall very good customer service Its a little thing but I really liked being able to print my boarding pass  no charge  at the concierges desk Prices at the coffee shop etc    forget it  Outrageous ripoff Location  cant beat it  Easy walking access to both ends of the Maginificent Mile the Pier etc  Only a few blocks from the StateLake CTA stop from which you can catch the Orange Line straight to Midway   for    The other lines are easy to access as well So for now this is an ok place to stay  Well see in ober  
N => Hated it I dont usually stay at Hyatt hotels and I was reminded why when I stayed here while attending a convention in the basement  The hotel looks old feels old and some of the modern amenities youd expect from a  star hotel were sadly lacking  Also the hotel is just too big for its own good  Check in is on the nd floor so you have to drag your bags up the escalator yourself no porters to be seen when I arrived at pm after a long transatlantic flight then you get asked to use the self service check in kiosks  I refused and asked to be served by a person and not a machine due to my having two arate reservations  The hotel guy completely blanked me and still wanted me to check in using the machine I was on the nd floor view was ok of the river but the room looked tired  Huge plasma was screwed to the desk so much so that there was hardly any desk left available to work using my laptop  Overpriced mini bar thin walls and doors and a small bathroom were also a drawback  The worst bit was the iron which fell apart in my hands and nearly ended up electrocuting me  On checking out I brought this to the attention of the registration staff and they just smiled politely offering a pathetic apology  The location of the hotel is good but thats about it  If you go to Chicago dont stay at this  room hotel with as much personality and charm as a low budget motel  
N => Pleasantly surprised with our exciting stay We spent Friday ch  at the Hyatt in the West Tower on the amazing th floor with a spectacular view of the river Lake Michigan and the city  I had booked the Amour Package which included a bottle of champagne with chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival gift certificates to the fabulous breakfast buffet and it was all wrapped up with a  p m  late check out We couldnt have asked for anything better as it accommodated our timing to get to OHare on Saturday afternoon to catch our Caribbean flight making our short but entire stay even more enjoyable We were thrilled with the heavenly comfort of the kingsized bed that provided an unusually fantastic hotel sleep that I often never get With being so well rested we were able to do a morning return walk to the Sears Tower to gaze out at the expanse of the lovely Chicago vistas We would definitely return to the Hyatt clean and impressive with helpful courteous and friendly staff we were treated royally Id be remiss if I did not mention their pleasant Concierge Service wow   simply an all round first class experience Highly recommended 
N => Awesome Location No Flat Screen TV thin doors Ok so you cant find a better location but we were suprised to not find a flat screen TV in our room  Also the door was not entirely that thick I honestly thought my wife was talking to me but it was someone outside down the hall thats how loud it was Also request a room far from the elevators as they are loud as well  Overall a very nice hotel but the noise and the minor details of it not being what we expected were a little disappointing  Very friendly staff  
N => Location great hotel good not great No matter what it is expensive to stay in downtown Chicago  Based on that i guess I shouldnt be to harsh in my review  It just seems to me that for what you have to pay to stay here you should get quotknock your socks off servicequot  I dont think you really get anymore here than you do in your average Courtyard hotel except for location  We requested a king room when booking but we were told they could not guarantee one would be available  When we got there we were told they were out of king rooms and we could request one in the morning and move  I called late morning and was told they still did not have one available but probably would later in the day  I was told the request for a king room was noted on my account and they would call and leave a message later in the day when one was available  When I returned to the room later that day there was no message so I called the front desk again  She put me through to an asst  manager and I wanted to know the status of my request  He told me he did not see a request on my account  I told him I had talked to  different people about this and was told it was on my account  He asked who I had talked to and that irritates me  I do not think it should be my responsibility to document my conversations with staff and I also feel like you think Im making this up when you ask me to document my conversations  I do not expect this kind of quotservicequot from a hotel of this caliber  They did have a king room available but I should not have had to go through this to get one If you want to park at the hotel it is up to  per night so keep that in mind when booking the room  There is other parking available for about  a night but it is  blocks away  The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable  They have quot flat TVs in the room but the picture is not in HD  Again for the price couldnt we have HD TVAll in all this is a nice upscale expensive place to stay in a very convenient location  No way would I call this a  star though  Its just a big clean hotel that can charge a lot for rooms because of where it is not what it is  
N => Great location I was able to get a great rate through priceline under   total and was pleasantly surprised  The location was perfect  In valet line we asked where we might find alternative self parking and the attendant guides us across the street where we saved   a night  The rooms are very nice but are small  Overall good value but I would be hesitant to stay here for the listed room rates 
N => Stay elsewhere until they reate Stayed here for  nights in a King quotior Suitequot  There are so many better places to stay in Chicago   This is rd time weve stayed here work makes us stay here and each time NO hot water  Thats even after running the water for  minutes to see if it ever comes  Since to me cold water is camping not hotel I called front desk and  minutes and  calls later someone from engineering told me the trick   you have to run the shower AND the hot water in the sink and then hot water comes   Despite our large room like other reviewers the walls were paper thin  We heard EVERYTHING  Im sure my neighbors did not enjoy our  year old son dancing and singing at  am but then again I didnt like hearing their drunk antics at  am   you get the picture   DIRTY Our room had a mini fridge with spilled nasty sticky stuff on the bottom when we checked in  Lightbulbs were burned out in the room  Scuffs and torn and ripped furniture  Our couch was so stained we did not want to sit on it  Ceiling of bathroom looked what can only be described as quotcorrodingquot  Some days our  glasses were clearly dirty lipstick ks on them   not mine   This is a HUGE hotel  There was a  person conference and at times wed have to wait  minutes to get an elevator  Also to get a cab sometimes took  minutes because everyone wants to leave for dinner at the same time On the good sideThe beds were ultra comfortable the bedding was clean and luxurious and the staff in the concierge lounge were helpful  
N => Poor service  There are some nice features of this hotel but I would never stay there again  I travel often amp can honestly say that the last night was one of my worst hotel experiences ever Pros excellent location modern clean nice views from some rooms Cons crowded elevator areas VERY noisy rooms toilets neighbors outside traffic no response when you need help We stayed over New Years  I understand that it will be noisy just after midnight but our experience was UNREAL  We booked w two other groups so we had three rooms to evaluate  Parties on every floor until AM  People yelling in halls all night teens smoking outside rooms non smoking hotel  It was more like a frat house than a hotel  It took FIVE calls to finally get the front desk attendent  She supposedly sent security to our floors but you wouldnt know it  Yelling amp banging amp flushing persisted until AM  Out of our group of  people we had a collective  hours of sleep In the morning we called the front desk for a cab to the airport  The snotty girl said cabs are always outside amp we could also take the shuttle  So we go downstairs and guess what No cabs  Too much work the night before  We look for the shuttle  It cost twice as much tas a cab but after the BS from the night before we were glad to get the hell away from this place If you value a good nights rest amp customer service I strongly recommend you find another hotel  
N => New Years at the Hyatt Regency My boyfriend and two of our friends ided to stay at the Hyatt Regency on New Years Eve   We were not going to go to the hotel party located within the hotel  We had other plans which were far better  However we chose this hotel for its good location and above average reputation Room  wonderful  The bed was very comfy and there was a sofa and a comfy chair  Also had a huge plasma tv The bathroom was nice as well with a wonderful shower  However it does need a bit more light plus the hair dryer didnt work Service from the moment I walked into the hotel I was the first one of my group there I was greeted and treated well  The front desk agent was very helpful and friendly  Also later we ided to open a bottle of wine and room service was more than happy to quickly send up a bottle opener Food We ate at the  Bistro for breakfast  The buffet was outstanding for a hotel buffet with an omelette station and everything  However it was a wee bit pricy at   Still though it was better than going out in the snow The only bad things I have to say are about the people who stayed at the hotel who DID go to the hotel party  When we arrived back at the hotel they were rude and drunk  When we got into an elevator some girl pressed every button so we stopped at every floor not the best when we were on the th floor  Overall though this has nothing to do with the hotel  I will stay here again if I need to  
N => Good Chicago hotel I stayed one night in uary  prior to attending a conference at another hotel I arrived early and was able to check in  The front desk person did not seem very friendly The room was nice but I did not have a good view The hotel complex is large  Just getting to the fitness center was a trek  It did have a nice selection of exercise machines The location is within walking distance to nearby sights and the L which will take you pretty much anywhere in Chicago I was able to get a nice rate for my stay but there are plenty of good hotels in Chicago so definitely shop around  
N => ent Hotel We booked our stay at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago on Expedia for  per night  This was not a great rate as it was the same on the Hyatt website  Anyway back to the hotel We arrived at  AM not expecting a room at the early time but upon check in we were surprised that they had one ready  Check in was a breeze however the staff seemed unpleasant Our room was fine as we didnt spend extensive amounts of time in it however if you plan on spending time other than sleep in the room you might want to consider a different hotel The beds were comfortable but the sheets felt cheap  The desk was large enough for a lamp laptop and some papers  The TV while plasma wasnt very good in terms of picture quality and the movie prices were outrageous The bathroom was large and well appointed but some of the tiles were cracked and the grout was dirty  The bathtubshower combo was fine but old  With all these minor flaws in mind nothing could beat our view  It was excellent  We had an unobstructed view of Lake Michigan the Chicago River and Navy Pier  It was so nice falling asleep in a setting such as this Hallways were long but well lit  The elevator lobby was average and it took FOREVER for elevators to arrive  I think they only had one or two working The main lobby was a great place to hang out and have an evening drink  It seemed oriented towards younger people and was a really hip and happening place The location of this hotel was great but to avoid walking over the bridge to reach Michigan Ave  I recommend the Sheraton across the river Overall we had a great time in Chicago  The Hyatt Regency was not worth the price but was a nice place to spend a few nights  Next time we will be staying at the Sheraton because of the location  
N => Chicago Hyatt Regency   eptive Business Practices The Chicago Hyatt Regency eptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation  ie the room cannot be cancelled  I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel  The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a  hour cancellation policy  However when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe Robert the reservation supervisor said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room  He said that I should refer to the confirmation e mail that states at the bottom thatprepayment is required at time of booking  non refunable  This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone  I told him to cancel without being charged  In response he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay  Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price The bottom line is the hotel eptively changed the terms of the agreement and Robert should go back to customer service school 
N => Be Aware BEWARE of Hyatts Reservation Policy My husband and I made reservations well in advance for a quiet romantic getaway in a smoking King bed or Two Double bed room  However at check in we were informed that they did not have our requested room  They said they would upgrade us actually downgraded to a very cramped One Double bed no smoking room a room that far less than what we had reserved  I have stayed in nicer motel rooms  It was slightly larger than a walkin closet and noisy being located directly over the glass ceiling bar with disco music thumping well into the night  When we contacted corporate we were informed that their reservation policy only guarantees that you will have A ROOM  It does not have to remotely resemble what you reserved  You can reserve a no smoking room and end up in smoking you can reserve a king bed and end up with a twin and a rollaway bed according to someone elses review  They apparently feel that you should just be grateful that you have a room  Its not that there isnt anywhere else to stay in Chicago nor any other city that they are located in I find this policy to be very eptive They know how many rooms they have  If they were upfront about what was available you would at least have the option of booking elsewhere or is that what they are trying to avoid Now that I know this I will definately stay elsewhere 
N => Ok But the room service was the best i have had in a long time Ok and just that  Service and just that but the room service was great had my food in  minutes but   a day for internet crazy when there are hotels that comp it or have it for free as wouldnt provide a fridge and bell man was very rude to the driver  
N => Great stay We booked our trip through priceline and got a great deal on our room  Upon entry the hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly  Our surprise came when we saw our room  We were on the th floor and had a beautiful view of the Chicago skyline The room was very clean  the toiletries were a nice touch toothpaste soaps  etc  The only main problem we ran into was parking  I had called prior to our visit and the woman told me that we could do self park with in and out priveledges for   When we tried to leave to go into town for dinner we were charged to leave  We spoke with the front desk and they told us that we were misinformed and that we could try and ask the valet if we could switch to that   We waited outside for  minutes and no one was out there so we left and paid  The drive to downtown was short and convenient Another problem was that there were no vending machines for late night drinks We ended up ordering a pizza with soda around  am from a local pizza place  The hotel was very clean and upscale  We loved it My boyfriend proposed to me here so I love it 
N => Alls well that ends well I took my family with me on a businessleisure trip  We arrived at the hotel after  pm to find they did not have any standard rooms  Apparently one of their guest ided to stay another day  The hotel offered to take us to another location or give us the living room section of a suite  We took the suite because we were tired and my convention started the next morning  Although the room was large wa wet bar the rollaway beds they provided did not offer a restful sleep for anyone in our party  I complained to the front desk the next day and they immediately moved us to another room gave us  breakfast vouchers a bowl of fruit and complimentary water  We also received a letter of apology from the hotel Manager and a phone number to call if we needed to  The room was wonderful We had a lovely view of the lake and downtown  Although the hotel is far from downtown they have a free shuttle that will take you to tourist sites  Kudos to the staff who made the rest of our stay enjoyable  This review is a little late in coming but i wanted to make sure they were thanked 
N => WOW Just returned from a night stay at Hyatt It was far beyond my expectation Staff were very willing to please Ate lunch at MX food was very good Ate Breakfast at Shor was GoodRoom had awesome view of city and was very clean Slept in alot of Hotels and this bed was by far the best Has shuttle that will take you to navy pier and Musuems But no return shuttle so be prepared to take cab back or bus Would recommend and return to this Hotel 
N => Only good if you have bussiness at McCormick Place stay elsewhere otherwise  Location location location  If you are attending an event or exhibiting at McCormick Place its a good place to stay because you dont have to deal with parking each day and can simply walk from the hotel to the convention center without even going outside  However as a hotel for seeing chicago its to far from downtown which means you will have to take expensive cabs just to get to the typical tourist attractions  Also there is an incredible lack of dinning options after midnight not even a vending machine and nothing within walking distance of the hotel so if you are coming in late to the hotel be sure to eat before you get there 
N => Solid hotel but the location was not to my liking This is a pretty ent hotel but I prefer to be a little more north  Most of the better destinations in Chicago are a few miles north of this McCormick Place location  This hotel has an excellent location to Soldier Field Shedd Aquarium Adler Planetarium and the Field Museum    so that was a positive  They offer shuttle service to various spots so the location might not be much of a problem for everybody  All told though it was a great bargain for me as I was able to secure a room for  per night thru Priceline but in the future I will look to stay a little north of this location I had a nice stay though and I would recommend this hotel     especially to those that plan on hitting the destinations I mentioned earlier and for those that have business dealings in or around McCormick Place  
N => absolutely   Perfect stay  I must say this place was perfect I and my son who is yrs old and a close friend ided to stay here because we got an awesome room rate  I must say i was a little leery i had no inside info on the place but it was everything we could have wanted  The staff was very accomodating the bell boys even played with the kids had a heated pool clean and every inch of the hotel was very clean   Our room was spotless The hotel featured a free Shuttle to vistor quothot spotsquot  and the parking was relatively cheap    a day self parknot to mention the hotel itself is modern and upscale  We will be back 
N => Stay closer to downtown Stayed here to go to Cubs game and then hang out in downtown area afterwards  There were  of us and no minivan taxis so we all crammed into one taxi  Was so far from downtown area we didnt go back there to change clothes because it would have cost to ride a taxi back and forth  If you are planning on being downtown for your outings my advice would be to find something downtown instead  We paid around  for our room  Im guessing you could find something for same price but with more convenience  Took a limo back to hotel and the driver couldnt even find our hotel  It is a very nice hotel but just too far from everything  Self parking is  and valet is around   
N => Do not stay here unless you must be near convention center  First the good  Bed was excellent with very good pillows although sheets were thread bare  Good desk chair  good hotel if your entire stay is for convention next door and you just want a place to sleep while being at convention center Negative Not what you think of as a Hyatt  We were booked by mistake at this hotel thankfully able to change to only for a one night stay  We could not wait to check out  Nearest restaurants are in Chinatown a  taxi ride away and they are poor  Would rate this hotel a   at best  Bellman watched us unload luggage from limo and place it on curb and only then did he offer assistance  Wall paper peeling in room and hall  Anywhere there could be dust it was there  Drab cheap or as previouly noted closet door is more like a shower curtain  Bath amenities almost none were  star not  star at they think of themselves  The TV was neither a flat screen or HD understand suites have hdtv and it must have been as old as hotel which I would guess is about  years  Internet so slow as to be almost unusable  
N => Other guests reviews right on the money I stayed at this hotel to attend a concert that was held at the Arie Crown Theater  Boy was I ever thankful that I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor about the hotel before I went to Chicago for the concert  First this hotel is a st choice if youre attending an event at McCormick Place  However take heed about what other guests note in their reviews    there are NOT any underline any amenities near by the area outside of the hotel  This area is devoid of restaurants sports bars conveniencedrug stores gas stations grocery stores shopping etc  This really surprised me because it seems to be an up and coming area  It really didnt matter that I was driving because I didnt want to take my car in and out of the parking garage because of the exorbitant parking rates  Besides it was too late for me to jumping on buses or flagging down a cab just to grab a bite to eat  So I went without food until the next day  Now sure I couldve eaten in the hotel but as other guests noted the food was very pricey  So plan ahead be prepared and bring your own food snacks and beverages if you stay at this Hyatt Regency  Or you can hop a cab or the bus into downtown to grab a bite to me and have more choices  One other thing to note the on site restaurants close early  When I was walked to the concert around pm all of the hotels amenties were closed  This was confusing especially since there was a concert going on next door  Guess they want to force you to order room service  The room was average  Walls are really really paper thin I could hear clearly the conversation of the guests next door  My view was spectacular  Fan for heater was very loud but I had to have it on since temperature was single digit  As I said if youre going to an event at McCormick Place its a good choice but make sure you have food and snacks for after the event and when all of the on site and overpriced amenties are closed  
N => Review    PROS Clean nice rooms comfortable beds adjacent to convention center good fitness center and pool  Restaurants staff excellent and friendly  I especially liked that just inside the rooms door there was a place to sit and take off shoes CONS Not close to Chicago attractions few restaurants nearby  Hotel shuttle only runs once an hour and only in the morning it takes guests to specific tourist locales no return trip offered plus you have to sign up for the shuttle as space runs out quickly  Daily Grind was overpriced and the staff was a bit slow OVERALL Found staff to be friendly and helpful and hotel was fine  There was a bus stop right outside the hotel and the bus would take you right into downtown Chicago  This was a good way to travel but the hotel staff seemed hesitant to suggest public transportation  
N => Best choice for attending McCormick Place If you are going to McCormick Place this hotel cant be beat  Its attached so you dont even have to go outside   Not to mention that you wont have to wait in the massive taxi lines that form for the McCormick Place Hotel is extremely good   Great rooms  view of Chicago nice fitness center pleasant staff  They clearly take pride in their hotel The downside of this hotel is that you have to taxi it if you want to head into Chicago  Theres literally nothing nearby and while its not a bad area its really close to Solider Field as well its deserted on the weekends and at night  
N => Serviceable but seek shelter elsewhere     Stayed here on a recent business trip despite the fact that I had no business at the convention center  The hotel is located on the south side of Chicago   much closer to Midway than to ORD  Got to the hotel early but they wouldnt check me in   i had a heck of a trouble trying to access the web thru my wireless quotairquot card   a theme that was repeated later on when i checked into my room Hotel is clean and efficient   the room that i was checked into was on a high floor with a beautiful view south  Room was clean but not luxurious  No Wi Fi in the room   i repeat   no wi fi in the room  This is a convention center business persons hotel and there was no wi fi  I have a wireless card that allows me to connect to the web anywhere i can get an att cell signal   but it did not work   i suspect the jam the signal so that you must buy their wired web service  Cab ride into downtownloop area not a bad ride   the hotel even has a free shuttle service operated by a chatty woman  The hotel gym is very very good  Lots of treadmills free weights and machines  I did not use the pool tho it looked pretty good  Outdoor sun k right by the poolgym No real reason to stay at this hotel unless you need the convenience during a convention   yes it is an OK hotel with some bright spots   but why subject yourself to this mediocrity   tman 
N => Nice hotel so so location We booked this hotel at the last minute after our trip to Florida had to be cancelled because of Fay  The staff was very friendly with the exception of one of the concierge  The parking charge is a little ridiculous but the valet guys were most helpful when telling us how to get around  The room was very clean and comfortable but nothing spectacular  We ate at one restaurant for breakfast one morning and wished we had just gotten room service since the price was the same  for  adults and  child although the staff there was very friendly and accommodating  We drove a few places but bought a CTA card the last day and took the bus el and a water taxi around the city  Its not a long bus ride and really the most economical choice considering you will pay minimum  downtown to park  If you cant stay right in town or in Grant Park or if you are going to a convention at Mccormick place this is not a bad choice however I would not pay the full price to stay there  
N => Do Not Stay Here We were very disappointed in our recent stay at Hyatt Regency McCormick Place   Furniture missing  Ex  no chairs  They said they had been broken and not replaced  Phone   You could call out but was broke and could not receive calls  The alarm clock was broke  No hot water in shower   For two days matter what time we tried the water was cold  Minor problems with room  Curtain for closet falling off  Our room was not ready until  hour after check in time Pros  Very accommodating staff in restaurant 
N => Better off at a Holiday Inn Adequate but missing basic amenities  No cups or glasses in the room  Bed sheets too short for the mattress  Room was dirty  None of the lights worked because they had been unplugged  Cant believe they dont have wireless and they charge for Internet Even a cheap hotel has free wirelessBottom line  its a place to sleep but its not what I expect from a Hyatt Regency  
N => No Staff Not Clean Not Helpful Just completed stay on   Hate to complain but    Arrived at pm to find floor full of breakfast trays outside  of the doors on the floor including our room  Our first room was water logged due to some sort heater leak  It was truly like a suana    not entirely bad in a Chicago winter Someone must have known because there were towels on the window sills  Manager was unhelpful wanted to fix the problem rather than assign new room  We were initially told there were no other rooms available then a few seconds later one quotjust popped up quotSecond room was a smoking room    not informed of this  Requested some shampoo and it never arrived It seems as if they were really short on staff but you would think they would have a handle on it by now  Suggest another hotel would be cleaner  
N => stay away  Would not stay here again  Service was bad and the concierge was nothing more that useless  
N => Hyatt Regency McCormick Place   pros and cons I just returned from a large conference in Chicago where I stayed at the Hyatt Regency that was attached to the conference center  There were definite pros and cons to staying there  The pros large clean room with comfortable beds never had to go outside to attend conference events speedy elevators and a nice fitness center  The cons not close to any downtown attractions or restaurants hotel restaurants were expensive and food only so so ridiculously long lines to get a cab to go anywhere at night and no free wireless anywhere in the hotel even the lobby areas  I cant ide if the convenience of being right at the conference events outweighed the other inconvieniences espcially being able to find something to eat  It required a cab ride to go anywhere for dinner and there was one night I waited  minutes in line in the lobby to get a cab to go downtown and another night that I ided it wasnt worth the wait and had a tasteless bowl of soup for  in the hotel restaurant  The concierege said the walk to the train downtown wasnt safe at night so the only choices were cabs or the bus  One night a group of us braved the bus to go downtown for dinner which was the most interesting experience I had during the trip There were some food courts in the actual conference center but they also seemed to have long lines and food that wasnt very good  So I was frustrated a lot with meals and wished I had packed some crackers or something to get me by  I was also aggravated at paying over  a night for a room and still having to pay another  for internet service even in the lobby  Im not sure Id stay there again even for a conference in the dead of winter where I didnt want to go outside to attend conference events  While the room was nice with a view of the city and lake it just didnt seem to be worth the cost and hassles  
N => Easy access to Lake Front  We booked our  night stay here for a conference next door  As it became close to our arrival I was nervous after reading reviews that I would be unhappy  In particular because we were not close to town  What we discovered was much different The room itself was great  The bed was enormously comfortable and we did not find noise to be a problem we were on th foor  We asked James one of the concierges where we could run and he gave us excellent directions to the Lake Front  Just down the street to the bridge on th street over the tracks and to the lake fron via Soldiers Field  We walked back from down town as well as enjoying several runs  The lake front is beautiful felt very safe and had lots of quotpeople traffic quot No scary quotbad neighborhoods quotThe main restaurant needs a major over haul The people were freindly and service was great but the room was stark hard and the lights too bright  The bar on the other hand was very comforatble and well laid out  The prices for all food was very high but there is not a lot of choice yet in the area  We did happen on a Society Bistro a few blocks away that had the BEST coffee and muffins for less than we paid for  coffees at the hotel  Near the museums  We were very happy with our stay   all personnel were friendly amp helpful   
N => So So We were attending a wedding in the area so we booked this hotel due to a package with free parking  The hotel was ok but I expected more  Things like strange long hairs in the tub moldy shower curtains and lipstick on the sheet covers just turn you off and you do not expect them at the Hyatt level  The front end staff also seems to be very confused  The breakfast buffet was  and definitely not worth the money even in Chicago  The pool is very small and a big disappointment to the kids  Not sure I would ever stay there again  
N => Would Stay Again Just returned from a  night stay with kids  The staff was very friendly and helpful  We got a free upgrade simply by asking  Our view was fantastic with a view of Lake Michigan the Magnificent Mile and Navy Pier complete with fireworks seen from our room  It took some searching but we also got complimentary free parking which was worth a lot over the  days    The money saved there was spent on cabs to our destinations  The shuttles run every hour but space is limited  We used them twice during our stay and if you want to be assured a seat its a good idea to sign up early in the day  We only ate breakfast at the hotel and it is pricey  But its Chicago and everything is pricey  We would definately consider staying again  I was a little hesitant at first after reading some reviews but everyone was very kind and seemed to be sincere in making our stay as pleasant as possible  And it was much appreciated 
N => Didnt get even close to what I paid for    We recently stayed at the Hyatt McCormick through a Valentines Day package which was NOT all it was cracked up to be First the room reservation was messed up we did NOT get the room I had booked Second we never received our chocolates at turndown as advertised  upon speaking to the front desk clerk we were assured they were going to be delivered  hrs later and checkout time    NADAThird we never received our breakfast vouchers as advertised and when we went to the front desk at first I was told we were not elligble After speaking with the clerk further we were issued the voucher however had all of  minutes left to get to the restaurant and eat as she said it was closing    And last but not least    the  a day parking was rather steep   All in all the room was ok the curtain rod closet was rather cheap looking and the bed was so so  For a king bed it seemed small  The restaurant was stuffy and pretentious not to mention very expensive  FYI the restaurants on their website do not exist anymore they have been replaced by a snobby cold eurochic restaurant called quotShorquot  The tini bar is non existant All in all I dont think I would EVER go back to this particular location  
N => If Your company isnt paying Dont Stay Stayed in the hotel for  nights  Arrived after Flight From JFK  Made reservation via there    Long line at reception so used the self check in  was given room with an open plan bathroom which looks cheap and tacky  Went back to reception and got a room change  Next room was better but had an adjoining door to a suite that had a conference taking place  Went back to reception Again and got moved to a room which was like the first with the open bathroom but was quiet so we put up with it  The Business center there has to win a prize for the most expensive ever  They Charge  a minute to use the computers and to print a page  a page  If you want Color print its  When the reservation was made I paid  a night extra for  people to have breakfast included  On getting to the hotel I was given some coupons for Continental breakfast which were Cereal and A piece of bread and tomato   Not good and not worth the   Yet if you want to change to a hot breakfast Forget the  value the coupons will be worth     each  The hotel offers a Bus to take you into town yet only takes you you re on your own to get back The Rate I was given was including tax But on Checkout they made me pay tax on top of the room rate  Not good service Wont stay again  
N => Hotel okay   Service Nay For  a night I was expecting a little more  The hotel itself was alright enough however the service was less than it should have been  For example room services stops at midnight and there is nothing within walking distance  Also I had to call down for towels every day often it would take an hour or more and additional calls for them to arrive  Also one day that i was there I came to the room about  p m  to find housekeeping in my room watching T V  which I had turned off before leaving  She then had the nerve to act annoyed that we were in the room and very rudely asked us to move so that she could vacuum  Also breakfast on one day took almost an hour to arrive at our table  The accomodations were clean however and the furniture was in good shape  No fitted sheets on the beds though  
N => Nice Fine business hotel  Staff was helpful  
N => Better than expected Let me first say that I was not looking forward to staying at this hotel  Initially I wanted a place closer to downtown but since my conference was at McCormick place I had little choice  Second I generally despise conference hotels since thay are impersonal and just too big for the personal touches and attention  What a suprise to find that the Hyatt at McCormick place defied my expectations  First and foremost the service was great  The staff to a person was pleasant helpful and often went beyond the call of duty  I was able to get an upgrade to a suite and a late check out for example  By the way the suite which was on the nd floor was wonderful and had a phenomenal view of Lake Michigan and downtown  The only downside as  people have commented in their reviews is that the hotel is out of the way and you end up paying a small fortune in cab fares to get around town  That being said if you are on conference at McCormick place this is the place to be  
N => Ok hotel not the best location  We only stayed one night in ember so not too much to go on here  The hotel itself is nice  The rooms were comfortable and clean  The hotel staff was pleasant enough  There are two major factors however that will preclude me from ever staying at this hotel again    While the hotel is perfect if you are planning on going to Soldier Field which is why we stayed there or to the Convention Center and not planning on going anywhere else its not very close to much of the action  You have to take a cab ride to get to any of the areas where there are things to do  Its about a  cab ride one way just to get to the Magnificent Mile which is really the closest area  For the price and location I would stay aroundon the Magnificent Mile itself    The restaurant in the hotel is a rip off  We had breakfast there ate the buffet and the service and food was absolutely horrible  They never came to refill our coffee  The food was cold almost inedible and they had no selection  After we asked for our check it took almost  minutes for our server to bring it to us  And all of this cost us over  for two people  We could have had a really luxurious breakfast elsewhere for that price  Horrible  
N => NOT impressed My husband and I are currently staying at the McCormick Hyatt for a conference  I am quite unhappy with this hotel and am VERY surprised it is a Hyatt The pros would be that it is attached to the McCormick Convention Center which is obviously convenient for anyone attending a conference  Also it was reasonably priced  The cons are as follows   inconvenient location for anything other than the convention center  NOTHING is nearby  NO restaurants shops etc  You must taxi everywhere  During our three day stay here we will spend around  for taxi service just to get to the heart of the citys activities    after returning to check in to our requested room which was not available when we first arrivedthe bell hop did not offer to take our bags to our room  In fact he scoffed at the request and stated quotSure but its gonna be a long timequot  Surprising as we thought that delivering bags to rooms is the job description of a bell hop   rooms are average  We were on the th floor which would have had good views of the city but the windows are extremely extremely dirty so it was difficult to see much of anything through them  Small bathrooms  Several large unsightly stains on the carpet in the hallways  Missing closet doors in the room   no concierge available in the morning for helpful restaurant advice and the gentlemen at the front desk was unhelpful and stated quotThere isnt someone at the concierge deskquotI would not stay at the hotel again or recommend this hotel  It does not live up to the Hyatt name   
N => Disappointed and Cheated this would not have been a bad experience if this were a very inexpensive hotel and if i did not have expectations based on other Hyatt hotels but considering the price and the Hyatt reputation I have to say this was the worst hotel experience i have had in many years  i am actually going to stick with Westin from now on for consistency alone let alone quality and service the service at the Hyatt was rude and unprofessional barely literate lazy high school types we got two cheap twin beds pushed together wed booked a confirmed King full rate the beds were uncomfortable and hard and very worn the hotel attached to the McCormick convention centre where our conference of  was had no clue where we should go for info about our conference  to top it all off wed asked to switch rooms to a king and were told we could not then or later   hrs later my friend checks in gets a king bed with deluxe fittings and shed paid lesser rate and booked months after  NOT a good way to treat customers  
N => Better than Expected My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for an extended   weekend  The big negative for us was the club scene in the lobby on Saturday night  The scene was loud chaotic and smokey  However we expected that from researching previous posts on this site and there were many positives with the rest of the hotel  During check in we had about a dozen couples ahead of us in line  This must happen often because there were at least six staff members at a long check in counter assisting people  One staff member did nothing but direct the next person in line to the first available check in staff memeber  We waited in line no more than   minutes  We were directed to check in at the assistant managers counter which is just to the left of the main check in counter next to the concierge  I dont know if that made a difference in the room that was offered to us but it  be worth requesting when you arrive  We asked for a quiet room in the west tower preferably with a view of the river  She said that would be a  upgrade charge  We said fine since we were able make our reservation using a night promotion that was posted on the Forum section of this web site  She said that room was not available yet but there was a Jr  suite available on the nd floor of the east tower that we could have at no additional charge  It turned out to be a double room with wet bar and refrigerator  A very good deal for night  We did not eat at the restaurant but found the lounges to be worthy of a drink before heading out on the town Except for the club it was an excellent experience  Just ask to be as far away as possible and you will be fine  
N => Great stay over new years  We are from Indianapolis Indiana and ided to take a trip to Chicago for New Years Eve  We had a wonderful time  It didnt take long for us to check in the rooms were nice and comfortable the service was excellent and the restaurant was great  This hotel is right off the interstate easy to find and in a great location  We had a great time great service and good food  The food was a little expensive but its Chicago  We had a blast  I should mention I am a travel agent and would recommend this hotel to any one of my clients  
N => Not impressed I stayed in this hotel for one night due to a business meeting in this hotel  I figured that based on the name it would be a ent hotel  The staff at the front desk was great and the guy helping me supposedly gave me a nicer room when I told him about the terrible taxi ride Id just had  When I got off the elevator on my floor the hallway was dirty with bottle caps and misc debris  The room I was about to enter had a  full glass of soda or something sitting outside of it which made me wonder if the maid had even cleaned the room  There happened to be a maid just down the hall and I asked her to please take the glass away  When I entered the room I immediately noticed the bedspread was messy and I could tell someone had sat down on the bed probably to watch tv while they were drinking the glass of whatever was outside the door  So I went back downstairs to the front desk and told the same guy what had happened  He felt really bad and upgraded me to an even nicer room supposedly  That room was okay but the bathroom was very dated with a plastic cheap trash can that I wouldnt even put in my own house  I guess I just expected nicer amenaties from such an expensive hotel  I will not stay at this hotel again given the choice  
N => Nice hotel great deal I booked  rooms on the quotGame Day Specialquot for night  Yes as other reviews stated it was a little out of the way  Walking anywhere other than the Lake through the hotel was not an option  However the free shuttle takes you up and down Michigan Ave and to Navy Pier  That combined with the free trolley service got us to Navy Pier then from there to Sears Tower for free  We also cut down our cab ride to dinner that night by taking the shuttle to the water tower then a cab from there which was  bucks  Of course the service is only one way  But we were hardly ever more than a  cab ride home so overall the location was fine  No matter where we wouldve stayed wouldnt have been next to EVERY place we wanted to go so cabbing it was necessary no matter what In terms of the rooms they were really nice  Not the best Ive ever stayed at but the bed was GREAT  Pillowtop with down comforter and pillows  The rooms were orated modern and I really didnt have any complaints  The rest of the hotel was nice as well  The only negative thing I will say about it was the prices of drinks and breakfast  Drinks were  bucks each and the breakfast buffet was  or so and absolutely horrid  It had sub par variety but what they did have was so bad I couldnt handle paying that much  A breakfast at a gas station wouldve been better  I complained and got one breakfast taken off which in the end was OK All in all this was a nice hotel for the price  Its close enough to be within a  cab ride home the rooms were nice and the price was right  Ill stay there again  
N => Nice hotel not the best location We stayed at this Hyatt last week for one night  Pros   Close to Midway Airport friendly and helpful staff nice room with great view of Chicago didnt have to pay for parking which was big considering   of the hotels we checked out did charge quite a bit ent price Cons   although the room was really clean I was not all happy to see spots on the comforter  Location   several miles south of where the action is but they do offer a complimentary shuttle one way only to get there  All in all fine for what we needed  
N => Just a tad too far If only   if only the Hyatt was just closer to the downtown action   if only the front desk staff were as forthcoming with information on transportation places to eat or shortcuts to the lake as the itorial staff   if only the shuttle started running a bit earlier and ran a bit longer   if only the pool was a real pool  the Hyatt would get a much higher rating  As they say its all in the details  Check in was fast and simple the room was comfortable although the products used for cleaning left a hospital like smell  I was a bit put off by the fact that our room only had  towels despite the reservation being for four  I did appreciate the water conservation program in effect  The gym was a big plus and the walk to the lake front through the convention center was perfect for a solo walker venturing out before am  Room service was actually better than expected but the hotel cafe is not worth a visit  As whole my experience was okay but if you have kids or if you want to be around the heart of Chicago this place is not for you  We got the room for less than   I wouldnt pay more for it than that   dont forget to add the  to  for daily parking  
N => Terrible service The day we checked in to the hotel we waited in line and then walked up to the counter and stood there while the check in attendant was doing something with his computer  Then without looking up he grabs my credit card and types in my name into the computer  He hands me my room key and that was that  He never acknowledged usWhen we walked in to our room we got situated and unpacked our suitcases and got a chance to relax We rang down to housekeeping for additional towels and robes  The robes came with out any belts There was no light bulb in the desk lamp One of the bedside lamps was unplugged and we had to try to move the bed to get it plugged in There was fresh bottled water on top of the TV console with no note on it stating there is a charge for it so we thought it was complementary and opened it up  The next anew bottle was placed in our room with a note on it  We spoke to the bell desk about the shuttle to the airport and we were told that the shuttle ran every   hour and was free  He specifically stated that we didn t need a reservation  When we got down to the lobby to check out and jump on the shuttle there was major confusion The driver of the shuttle was trying to squeeze  elderly over sized adults into his van and was telling us that he had a group that made reservations We had to get off that bus and take the next one  Our stay at the McCormick Place was a disappointment We spoke to others on the shuttle bus drive to the airport and they had a terrible experience as well  I would not recommend this Hotel for any of our corporate meetings  The service was terrible Outside of physically connected to the growing convention center the facility has nothing to offer  Access to any of the areas attractions is cumbersome at best and could be dangerous for those that did not know the area at all  
N => Guess Im just a podunk from smalltown USA Bring your wallet stuffed with bills Accommodationswere fine but very cashy  Room ratewspecial discounted rate and attached parking garage sorry no special hotel rate ran about  Use the valet parking day so you can get your car in and out to go downtown they failed to tell us this it cost us an extra  
N => Dirty noisy incompetent   Very disappointed  
N => worst hotel  
N => Good if you have a conference otherwise stay closer to downtown  
N => Great Deal Old charm at a good price  Not a cookie cutter hotel  Pleasant walk to Brown Line  We were able to park the car free in their lot during the week with no problem  Only had to pay Sat night in the lot across the street for   Breakfast had many choices for a complimentary meal  We did have a room looking at a brick wall but that was more than OK  No noise  Our last stay in Chicago had many nights interupted by traffic because well who doesnt need a McDonalds at am 
N => room ok bathtub cloged the room was nicebig and clean but the shower had a drian issue the water backed up in the tub not good i recomend they get that fixed 
N => Room OK  Staff terrible We wanted to get away for the night so we rented their King Suite with Whirlpool  First the good the room was large and clean  The whirlpool tub was large and there was never a problem with hot water  All in all this room was great  The bad the staff was horrible  It was like we were interrupting their day by making them do their job and check us in  The Assistant Manager was even at the front desk and did not even acknowledge us standing there no hello or anything  After the check in you would have thought it was torture to the front desk agent we were on our way  I had to check out early in the morning so the night desk agent was still on  I went to the desk where he was counting the cash drawer  He knew I was standing there I was the only person around after he finished counting the quarters he wrote down how much was there and then started counting the dimes  I am standing in front of the man for a few minutes he wont even look at me so I just leave  The only good staff members of this hotel are the housekeepers  They go out of their way to say hi and make sure that you have everything you need  The front desk and the management of this hotel need the housekeeping staff to train them on customer service in the hospitality industry  
N => Charming A little apprehensive since the reviews were so mixed but we loved this place The location was unbeatable  TONS of bars restaurants pizza shopping   within two blocks  Try the awesome little grocery store just up the street   I forget the name but go right on Diversey   less than a block away   they had EVERYTHING you could ask for as far as liquor food groceries etc  Bus stop was just  to  blocks and takes you downtown in  minutes for   The hotel itself was just charming  Yes its old and we reserved the economy room so werent expecting much  VERY pleasantly surprised  Room was a nice size with a small dressing area alcove with big mirrored door closet  Bed was fine TV fine  Yes carpet is worn   but really who cares Loved the bathroom   it was very old fashioned with high ceiling tile deep tub pedestle sink  We had a coffee maker which we didnt use because there was coffee  hours in the lobby which was excellent  Wouldve been nice to have a fridge but no big deal  Room was very clean very quiet and the ambiance of old fashioned hotel was very cool to us  Girls in the lobby were mega helpful   told us fun bars to go to how to get everywhere and kept our luggage for us after check out so we could run downtown before going to the airport  The breakfast was more than a typical continental   bagels croissants donuts toast cereals eggs sausage bacon coffee juice  Yeah   it wasnt restaurant quality but is was good and HELLO   FREE If you really like staying at a Radisson or a Hilton you probably wont like this place   but I loved it   it had character without sacrificing anything  Did I mention that the price was  Try and beat it  Id stay here again with NO hesitation  
N => Its okay Came here for a Cubs weekend w the guys  A bit frightened from past reviews but I think when it comes down to it there are good rooms and bad rooms in this place  Our three rooms were all good ones No you are not at the Grand Hyatt nor Four Seasons   but youre not paying those premiums either In simplest terms you want to be in a great location inexpensively and not going to be in your hotel much this is a great option and its not a CSI Crime Scene nor other horror stories that are being painted although Ill admit some of the inconveniences  like lack of water pressure  did occur  If you want luxury head down to the Magnificent Mile 
N => Terrible DO NOT STAY HERE So we stayed  nights with this hotel   we got greeted with the front desk informing us that we were going to be required to switch rooms on our second day cause they overbooked or something  The room was to a s style with a bathroom the size of a closet couldnt even open the door because it ran into the toilet  The shower only sprayed out a few drops of water and fluctated between going hot and cold  The second night we had to switch to a double bed which was hard as a rock room that was the size of a closet   it had NO air conditioning and had to argue with the staff up front to get a fan to put in the window so we didnt sufficate  Our bathroom window didnt even have a screen in it so the option of opening that for air was out of the question  The second bathroom was better but only got about  drops of water out of that shower Dont be fooled by the pictures on the website or the lobby when you walk in   the lobby is fully remodeled and gorgeous but wait until you get back to the room section Basically bad service crappy rooms and WAY OVERPRICED There is a nice Days Inn only  block away   go there instead   you will enjoy your stay much better 
N => Like a CSI crime scene What annoys me most about this hotel is that when you walk into reception   you have no idea how bad the actual bedrooms are going to be Damp mouldy walls the most stained mattress youve ever seen and electrical sockets that simply didnt look safe  And then there was the toilet     flushing was like a russian roulette game that we didnt always win   To top it all   it wasnt even that cheap DO NOT BOTHER 
N => Not Good    The main problem was that the rooms are dirty and the staff arent very helpful  We switched rooms upon check in since the room we originally got was extremely small and run down  The next room was much larger but not exactly clean and comfortable  We encountered a cockroach in the bathroom and bugs in the tub Beware of the complimentary cookies in the looby  There were about  fruit flies enjoying them The weekend we were there staff needed to let us into the rooms  We never did get a good explanation as to why we were not given keys The air conditioner window unit did not work properly nor did the TV At night we expected much better  If there were any rooms available in another hotel close by we would have checked out within the hour but we couldnt find anything Id stay away  
N =>  for a broom closet Booked full got a twin bed in a room the size of a itors closet  The bathroom was so small I had to leave the door open just to use the toilet  TV was a choice of  channels  The desk personnel were the rudest people Ive ever met  A refund was refused as was a room change  Theyll NEVER see me again 
N => Better than sleeping in the car    We paid over  a night for a x box with a really uncomfortable bed  The air conditioner worked well though and we also got a ent continental breakfast with the standard cereals and muffins  I probably wouldnt stay here for more than one night but it served its purpose  I definitely wouldnt stay here if I was trying to relax or anything   it was more of a place to keep our stuff while we were exploring the city  It was definitely convenient and close to everything   althought the nearest quotelquot station was under construction the day we were there so we had to walk a few extra blocks  My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night when driving through Chicago  We did not have reservations ahead of time so we took our chances in finding a hotel on the spot  I liked the Lincoln Park area and this was the first place that had a room available so I think we got what we expected  
N => Great Location Not Much Else I stayed at this hotel during the week of y th   I am giving the hotel a  star rating based on the followingPlussesGreat location    Easy to get public transportation and walk to the park    restaurants are everywhere and if you want to go to Boystown thats also within walking distanceFriendly Staff    they treated me very wellNegativesPretty much everything elseThe bed was probably  years old and I could feel the springs bumping against my spine    OUCHOutdated everything    from the TV to the furniture to the bathroom to tacky bedspread   YUCKAirconditioning didnt work too good either   Some reviews said it was noisy but I didnt find that to be the case Overall I didnt pay a lot for the room so I didnt expect much  It lives up to low expectations  
N => Warning Your reservation is not guaranteed Not worth the risk DO NOT BOOK OR STAY HEREI booked a room five weeks ago but they just cancelled my reservation with little notice so that I am unable to find anything similar in the neighbourhood  They offered me a room at a motel  MILES AWAY by the airport  These people SUCK 
N => Not equipped to serve everyone To begin with do not confuse this with The Days Inn at Lincoln Park in Chicago  This confusion is probably why I had such a bad experinece  I have stayed at the Days Inn there and been quite happy  We paid  apiece for a double rooms  So for three evenings the bill was close to  with tax  There was no bell service  My companion had just finished a long bout with cancer and was unable to carry her own bags and I arrived later  No one available until I got there  We are two middle  aged women The heat in both rooms the other was my brother and his wife was unbearable for days and when we finally were able to speak to someone after  day language was sometimes a difficulty we we told that it was because both rooms were located above or below the boiler rooms  It was obvious that they had known this was a problem before   There was a Cubs game that weekend  The solution in the freezing weather after  days was to put in air conditioners in both rooms  We became more comfortable after that but for  evenings my traveling companion got very little sleep and the same was true with the other rooms occupants  I eventually took something to do so  The other room was occupied by my brother and his wife  who were told free internet was offered  It was not free  I told the desk attendant that one could go next door to Starbucks and do it for free and he replied that this was the only Starbucks in the country where this could be done  I felt as if I were a tourist in a country where they believed we had no idea how things run  I would never have written this if they had offered any discount whatsoever but we paid full price and i have stayed in many hotels in Chicago  We paid more than others were paying because we spoke to them  We chose the hotel for its location near where we needed to be and know that in Chicago  it is well located  Terrible disapppointment  
N => Very dissapointing We spent Sat  ember th at this place called a hotel  It was the worst experience we have ever had  We reserved a  double bed room and it should have only had  bed in it it was so small  The paint was peeling off the wall and plaster was falling off the ceiling  The tiles in the bathroom were cracked which is a breeding ground for mold and germs  You could not open the door all the way because it would hit the stool  Then you had to slam the door to close it  There was no room to put anything anywhere by the sink  The mattress sank in the middle and was very uncomfortable  The carpet was dirty  You know when you pay a cheap price you expect a place like this but believe me it was not cheap  I dont know where they got the pictures for the web site because they are nowhere close to that  I DO NOT recommend this hotel to anyone  We will NEVER stay there again and will tell everyone how bad it is  
N => DISGUSTING Do Not Stay Here Our room was unsanitary and the front desk staff did not care   even the woman who identified herself as the front desk manager  This is not worth it to you no matter what the cost  
N => Just like home service  I attended the Rotary International th anniversary convention in Chicago  Since most of the hotels were out of reach for my social security pocketbook I booked a package through Orbitz and received a reservation at the Inn at Lincoln Park  I was pleasantly surprised since the Inn had only a  star rating  My room was quite adequate although the air conditioning unit might not do too well on the hotter days in Chicago and the bathroom was certainly larger than expected  The continental breakfast included with the room was plentiful fresh and served in a delightful quotcafequot which just happened to be right across from my room  The residential area all around the hotel is charming and you can find anything you need to buy or eat  However the major asset this place has is its staff  Every single person was courteous and helpful responding immediately to every question and request  Morgan was outstanding He by himself is worth a visit to the Inn An ironing board and iron as well as a hair dryer appeared almost instantaneously and every question was answered  The steakhouse he recommended was outstanding and I even walked back to the hotel at  pm at night with no trepidation If you are looking for an economical charming place to stay  this is it  
N => The Worst In  years of traveling around the world this is the worst place ever  Do not stay here  Terrible disrepair    stained carpet cracked tile  years overdue for paint broken lamp leaking shower faucets broken bathroom shelf   yr old TV  Linens are not changed daily  Had to sit sideways on toilet due to cramped bathroom  No iron or ironing board available  Indifferent desk clerk  Phones did not work  Hallway reeks from tobacco smoke  Room preposterously small  Need I say more Cancel your trip to Chicago if this is only place that has rooms available  
N => The worst hotel  Do not stay at this hotel We stayed at this hotel because of some good reviews  When we checked in and got into our room the bathroom was a mess  The toilet as used the stuff was all over the lid of the toilet and it was not flush at all  I almost got sick  I called the front desk and ask someone to clean it up Some one did clean it up  I also asked for the supervisor and no one shows up  The supervisor or manager did not even call me My husband and I were so tired from the flight or we would have leaved the place  I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone  
N => Great Location Thats about all stayed at the Inn of Chicago for  nightsvery well situatedrooms are comfortable but could do with water and t bags as there is no breakfast room or restaurant at this hotel Travelled all the way from Scotland to be given a room on the th floor looking over the riot hotels brick wall at the back a view wouldve been nice Arrived at reception to be greeted by staff who at the time couldnt be more awkward or rude if they tried to a fellow guest who was obviously in distress all because they couldnt get her card to swipe treateed like she was a criminal and not a guestthought to myself i certainly wouldnt put up with that treatmenthowever when my dhters swipe card for her room wouldnt work the young spikey haired lad at reception who also looked after the guest in was referring to then tried to do exactly the same with myself and managed to press all of my buttons to the point he was a very lucky his manager stepped in not the way you want to be spoken to whilst having a vacation T he Bar If you like to wind down at night with family or friends you certainly cant do it here as the bar opens approx pm and closes at whatever time the barperson ides and on the night we were meeting our friends who had travelled from kentucky happened to be pm and not only on this occasion however Dan was a very nice person but as he admitted was part of a union so dont expect to be served within  minutes or more if he has someone else hed prefer to chat to Waited years to take my son to Chicago as hes always been a massive Bulls fan only to be Dissapointed in this historic hotel The hotel however is perfectly located and the porters are definately the nicest and most helpfull of the staff and nothings to much for them and thankgoodness someone seems to care about customer service I dont usually rant on unless im mistreated and i do know what customer service is as i do own a hotea guesthouse and a publib bar in dif towns in Scotland and none of these staff except for the porters and the black lady behind reception would be employed by us even if it meant we had to work hours a day till someone else came alon Theres plenty more hotels in Chicago and whilst this one is central i would give it a miss this time aroundOur kids are  and  and our friends are early s as well as ourselves and we all agree and all had plenty of fun elsewhere So sad for such a great hotel with history that no one seems to care Long live the unions Not 
N => Convenient and pleasant We got this room for around  a night including taxes  The location is great just feet from Michigan Avenue and convenient to transportation and a great place to set out on walks  We walked to the Art Institute quite easily  Check in was good  We arrived early and the room we booked a queen as not available so the very nice clerk arranged for us to have a king room instead  The room was not enormous by any stretch but more than enough room to turn around and be even dance between the TV and the bed  The room was on a corner with two windows the main one overlooking Michigan Avenue I noticed they were gradually upgrading the rooms on the mezzanine there were stacks of boxed plasma TVs and the nd floor  we were on the th  was noticeably fresher than ours but our unupgraded room was just fine  The bathroom as small but not claustrophobic  For whatever reason the sink had obviously been recently replaced with one of those furniture like models and it was very handsome but way out of scale to the rest of the bathroom Requests for extra pillows and towels were fulfilled by the cleaning staff without any trouble  The bar staff was super nice  The Lavazza coffee shop in the lobby was convenient although the gelato was mediocre The crowd here skews young  The lobby tries and generally succeeds at being hip and modern  
N => Value for Location but disappointing  Recently stayed on business trip  Lobby has been reated to appear as a boutique hotel but this isnt true for the rooms  Faded but clean room  Small bathrooms with no counter and shoddy worksmanship  We had to change rooms because of the odor of the carpet cleaning solution used in the hallway  Free wi fi in lobby was a plus  Front staff were very helpful and friendly but overall it was disappointing  
N => Id definately stay again I hadnt stayed at the Inn of Chicago for years and after reading some of the negative comments was a little reluctant  Glad I booked it  The front desk was extremely friendly  Surprisingly the manager came out to greet me welcomed me to the hotel and told me not to hesitate to contact him if he could do anything to make my stay more enjoyable  Room was roomy and clean  The only negative was that the mattress was so soft we kept feeling like we were rolling to the center of the bed  The hotel is a great location and well maintained  Well definately stay here next time we visit Chicago and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends  
N => Great Location Good Prices    We have stayed here for  nights  The location is great very close to the Loop  We stayed in a standard room but it was like compressed the bath too  There was a door to another room I guess luckily it was locked  The air conditioner was a little bit noisy and very old  If you are not looking for luxury but a budget place close to the Loop I recommend the Inn of Chicago Magnificent Mile  
N => Dont get too picky Ive read all the negatives   and there is an element of truth to them  On the whole however I thought this was a good place to stay  We previously stayed here before the reations the place is much better now  The staff were friendly enough I dont expect gush  Sean behind the desk deserves a special mention he dealt with a minor reservation glitch by giving us a better discount than I ever expected and upgrading us to a corner room with a bigger bed  Yes the bathroom was tiny though it wouldnt actually cause any problems to a normal sized person Did the roof terrace close at night Yes but only when youd had chance to watch the sun set and it was pitch black  There were signs telling you not to bring in drink from outside but in view of the hotel bar prices none of the guests seemed to take any noticeWas the bar expensive Yes hotel bars always are  Was it full of oldies too scared to venture out Well I probably was one of those oldies collapsing into the bar for a last nightcap with my wife and our friends after quothitting the townquot from morning till nightIf you want to be picky pay a lot more money and stay in a better hotel then get picky This is probably the cheapest hotel on Michigan Avenue  
N => Great Location Reasonable Price Mediocre Service We stayed here for  nights in mid tember  The price was fair about night and the location was great  Easy walking distance to the Navy Pier River North Streeterville etc  and it was practically on the Magnificent Mile  Close to the subway at State Street Amenities were ok  Nice workout room with good and ample equipment  Nice top floor terrace with a good view although the hours werent great    it closed at pm  One big drawback was no free WiFi in the rooms    you had to go down to the lobby which was usually filled with other guests doing the same thing  Particularly bothersome was that you could not get WiFi reception in the hotel bar which was just a few feet away from the lobby The room was clean and the maid service was good  The TV was an old CRT and the picture was a little fuzzy  The room is on the smaller side and the bathroom is really tiny  We couldve used  pillows instead of  and plush instead of feathered  Other than that the room was fine The bar was kind of lame  The only patrons were middle aged to senior aged guests of the hotel who seemed to frightened to venture outside  The beer selection was terrible who needs  domestic lagers and overpriced  We didnt try any quotsignature cocktailsquot and Im sure we werent missing much  The bartender was a bit of a jerk too  We hoped to see a different bartender later in our stay but it was the same guy every night The bell desk was cool about keeping our bags for us while we did some more sightseeing on our last day after we checked out  The bell staff was very helpful and friendly beyond their duties The front desk staff wasnt terrible but seemed aloof and nonplussed about working there  On the first night our keycards were somehow erased and we had to go to front desk to have them replaced  The staff didnt seem to concerned or apologetic about this inconvenience to us As for food there was a nice teacoffee shop across the street a  hour Dunkin Donuts  and a burrito place that was not that great  Also a gay bar called quotSecond Story Barquot which we almost tried out before reading that it was a gay bar were a straight couple    nothing against gay bars just not our scene At night there was a creepy lurking security guard who gave everyone who was sitting in the lobby silent dirty looks  A little odd Other reviewers complained about the noise and proximity to a fire station  We were on the th floor and didnt have any complaints about that  The walls are thin however and we had some rowdy frat boy neighbors the last night we stayed there Overall for the price and location this hotel was worth it  If youre looking for better amenities e g  breakfast free WiFi then you might want to stay somewhere pricier  But this was a ent hotel and we were basically happy with our stay  
N => Not what we thought it would be    Check in Our room was not ready till  check in at  and they kick you out by  noon not sure why it takes   hrs to clean such a small room The front desk clerk was so rude The room was small dark dirty looking  The Bed was not comfortable a sheet as the main cover of the bed    The bathroom was so small hit your knees on the sink if you are sitting on the toilet  Waiting in line for an elevator everytime you try to up or down  Having the maids storage next to our room was not great   they are so loud banging stuff around in there  was up every morning by  bc of that For the price we paid I should have spent an extra  to stay at a nice hotel down the street  The door guys at other places where nicer than this place  Not one person the entire  days said one word to us   I would never stay here again if it was free 
N => Great Location Horrible Rooms We stayed her because I got a good rate with Hotwire Travel Ticker and we were on a budget for our hotel room  We also picked it because it is so close to Michigan Ave  which was great but our stay was anything but  Our room looked nothing like the rooms they display on their website  It looked like the or hadnt been touched or changed in years  The bathrooms were so small that only one person could be in there at a time and if you really wanted to you could go to the bathroom and wash your hands at the same time  The beds were very uncomfortable and the duvet cover was only enclosed by two flat sheets which was disgusting because I doubt they wash the duvet covers very often  After a long day of shopping and running around we were ready to get back to our room and shower  The hotel only has  small elevators for  floors that fit four people comfortably and  people tight  We had to wait in line and for numerous elevators to come through before we could even get on one  That drove me crazy since all I wanted to do was sit back and relax not wait in line for an elevator  It wasnt enjoyable relaxing in the room because the room was much smaller than an average room you would find at Hampton Inn or a Holiday Inn  
N => Perfect Didnt cost that much I had gotten a discount  Was right in the heart of downtown  A lot of other people complained of small rooms but I had gotten a pretty big one  Friendly staff  Its not the Ritz Carlton but It was safe clean and comfortable  
N => Says its  stars   not even close  Fair at best  Stayed here on a last minute quotdealquot   advertized as  star hotel  Its a stretch to call it a  star  Good location but otherwise nothing but disappointments  Poor service only fairly clean below average small rooms and bathrooms not very attentive service  Wouldnt stay there again unless the price is ROCK bottom  
N => NPE  Its ok for business trips  Few steps from Michigan Avenue  Clean  Good wi fi connection  Good bar service  No breakfast service but a nice Lavazza shop next the side entrance  
N => Shockingly Negative Experience Very disappointed in the Inn of Chicago as a return visitor  The customer service has not been a pleasant situation due to a financial situation that has occurred  Prior to check out I went to the front desk and requested to pay  cash towards the room prior to check out with my boyfriend  I mainly wanted to pay for the valet of my car however ided that the even dollar amount would be good  I handed over the cash and the cashier looked at me as if I was wasting her time at that time I required a receipt be provided I must admit it was my fault for not reviewing the folded up receipt because the cashier charged the credit card that reserved the room  Once the credit card statement was received there were two charges one in the amount of  and the other for the remaining amount  Very odd how the one receipt that was for  cash does not have a cashier number listed   The accounting staff has not been pleasant and is not willing to connect us directly with the hotel manager office manager front desk manager etc we keep getting the run around and keeps insisting that we will receive a call back  I do however find it odd that the accountant has reviewed the video tape and apparently stated that I paid with a credit card which was never swiped and what in the world would the cashier do with the credit card since she didnt hand anything back to me  I feel that they are not taking the proper steps to resolve this issue  We will not be staying here again if you cant trust the lobbycashier staff on camera who can you trust  We stayed at the Inn of Chicago to save money with a discount as a returning customer however in the long run paid more  
N => WARNING OUR SOUVENIRS WERE STOLEN OUT OF OUR ROOM BY THE CLEANING ATTENDANT we just returned from a cruise and had left our souvenirs w our other things in the room  the night before checking out we noticed they were missing and called security  security told us that they do BAG CHECKS OF ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES before they go home after a shift   obviously they dont trust their employees at all  they took our statement said an investigation would take  days but we insisted on immediate action  the hotel manager was unable to reach the room attendant because  she failed to show up for her next shift and  refused to return his calls  the manager offered to reimburse us the money but those souvenirs and gifts are gone  we called to follow up but the manager is ignoring us and not returning our calls  DONT STAY HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR BELONGINGS 
N => You get what you pay for I would avoid this hotel  The pictures do not represent the hotel  Yes the lobby is quotnicequot but the rooms are awful  When checking in they asked if we would like a larger room but it would have only a shower not tub  We agreed  The room was so small we barely fit two people in it  They neglected to tell us the room was a handicap room so the shower head was not an appropriate height for a standing person  We could here EVERYTHING from another room through the vent in the bathroom  My husband ended up removing the grate and stuffing a towel in it  Everything from the hallways was amplified not to mention the acheating unit sounded as if it were going to take off to s  I was woken up each and everytime it turned on and shut off  We have stayed in hotels much nicer than this on the Mag Mile for roughly the same cost  Dont be fooled  Do your homework and you can find a better hotel for a great price  Oh and I believe it had been some time since the bathroom was last cleaned  
N => GREAT BUDGET HOTEL Great central location trendy lobby and helpful staff  Rooms not that great  It was freezing cold even with heater running non stop   mind you it was in uary  Bath room is incredibly tiny  no hot water when i went to take a shower  Despite the quality of the room as long as you dont plan to spend too much time in your room the hotel is in a great location with friendly staff  
N => Avoid at all costs  PL lenty of other options Had a terrible experience with this hotel  After booking the hotel via hotwire it took  days calling trying to get someone who knows wha they are talking about and get them to add a king size bed  They also provided false information about parking and the rates they charge  I had to search for cheaper parking elsewheere which took half of our day  At arrival the lady working the desk was very rude and unhelpful  Following morning I checked my bank account and hotel charged  extra on top of my hotwire booking  Asked them to clear it and they assured me they would but a day later same problem  After  days finally the charge was reversed  On  st we had to wear armbands in order to go in and out of the hotel  On  st we had no hot water  Coffeemaker was broken  The sink water would only go to lukewarm temperature  Bathrooms are tiny   people would not be able to fit  Same goes for elevators   ppl would have problem squeezing in  Did not recieve the check out bill at my room on the morning of departure  When walked downstairs to check out I saw the that they charged double for my parking due to yet another error on their end  No room service  Bar downstairs extremely overpriced  I have nothing positive to say about the Inn of Chicago  Stay away at all costs  
N => Excellent My husband and I accidently end up here  I was very sure Ive booked Best Western River north through Midashotels location was interesting and the free parking as well  When we arrived there we were told that we booked at the Inn of Chicago which was a Best western in the past  There was no free parking so I was very disappointed but that only lasted until I saw the room  It was very nice very clean and large enough  Location was even better then the best western I booked  We were just steps of Michigan Av and much closer to the lake  It was our beginning of our Route  journey but spend an entire day in Chicago  We walked from the hotel to Lou Mitchells via Michigan Av  From there we headed toward the lake and stopped at the Sears Tower on our way to the lake  We walk all the way up to the Navy Pear and then headed back to the hotel  In the evening we went to the Hard Rock Cafe which is in a walking distance and had dinner at the thai restaurant I dont remember the name not far from the hotel  We both loved chicago very much so theres a good chance that we will go back and see a little more of the city  We will absolutely stay in the Inn of Chicago again even if we have to pay  a day to park our car  
N => As bare bones as it gets   this place sucked  I stayed in a recently reated executive queen room  The floor in the bathroom was filthy and the room was so unbelievably small I barely had room to walk around after I put my suitcase down  One plug in in the bathroom and the internet access was a complicated mess   they gave very poor instructions at the front desk as to how to connect  The location saves this hotel as it is very convenient to everything  
N => Great location bare bones accommodation Chicago is a very expensive city and we left it until the last minute to book a hotel for our ust vacation a mistake we will not make again  The only downtown hotel for anything close to a reasonable price for my family of four was the Inn of Chicago at  per night  For that sum we got a clean room with comfortable beds but nothing else  I have not been in a hotel for a long time that had almost no amenities but this was one  There was in room coffee but no newspaper no breakfast no in room internet access unless you wanted to pay an extra  per day  Free WIFI was available in the lobby  The bell staff was extremely helpful and pleasant lessons that the front desk staff should take  They werent rude exactly just cold and not very helpful  I would only stay there again if I were in the same pinch I found myself in this year  
N => Horrible service For starters I would never stay at this hotel ever again  We went to check in Friday afternoon at PM and didnt end up getting a room until PM that night  They kept giving a handful of customers the excuse that the rooms arent ready yet and needed to be cleaned and the cleaning staff went home for the night  This is after PM at night What have these people been doing all day We were suppose to get  rooms with  doubles beds in each but they only gave us  rooms with  king bed in each  We had to sleep three people to a bed    tons of fun let me tell you The bathroom was the size of a small closet and the toliet seat had dried paint and glue stains all over it not to mention the mold in the shower  A receptionist by the name of Kathy was probably the rudest women I have ever met  She looks like a sweet grandma but dont let that fool you  She turned her back and walked into the back office area three times while I was talking to her trying to get our rooms straightened out  The  dozen or so people waiting in the lobby were all irrate at the horrible service and      these people were trying to feed us  I have honestly never seen something like this in my life I can understand your  disgrunted customer but not  dozen all at the same time  I was waiting for a fight to break out there was so much yelling and frustration in that place I wish I would have read previous reviews before staying here  These people are right about the rude service  
N => Exactly what we were expecting We stayed there one night this past weekend  It was what I expected  An adequate hotel with a fantastic location  The front desk staff were a little rude when we checked in but the next morning the guy was super nice  We would go back unless we had the money to go a little nicer  
N => Good little hotel A good little hotel with an excellent location  The room was comfy  A ent affordable place to stay for your visit to Chicago  I would be willing to stay here again  
N => Great Place for the pricelocation Hotel was excellent  Rooms were nice clean comfortable and modern  Service was fantastic  We were able to check in earlier than expected  They also got us a cab to get us back to the airport in a timely manner  The location was perfect close to shopping and subway  Price was reasonable too Would recommend this hotel to a casual traveler who wants a nice comfortable place to stay in a central location  
N => Unimpressive experience Dont expect much staying here aside from location  Its great walking distance to Magnificent Mile shopping but thats about it  Im hesitant to say the place was unclean because things were in fact cleaned for me but it was more the fact that it wasnt well maintained  I got a deal online so the price was right but I would look elsewhere and pay extra in order to not stay here again  I would give it  out of  stars nothing more  
N => Horrible   Never Stay Here Dont take a chance  Dont stay here Rude service people rude managers and tiny rooms  
N => Absolutely Dreadful Experience The Inn of Chicago Magnificent Mile was the worst hotel experience I have ever had  The rooms and common areas were filthy the walls were thin and unfortunately left you able to hear rather unpleasant activities going on in other rooms  Although updates had been made they were poorly done  The pictures online dont even come close to closely depicting the actual ambiance  I would never recommend this hotel  
N => Stay elsewhere Stayed here  night for work  I travel to Chicago often and enjoy trying new places  Of the  hotels Ive stayed at this was the WORST  Service was moderate at best  The rooms were very old uncomfortable bed poor water pressure in the shower  I didnt feel clean the entire time I was in the room  Luckily we were out late after dinner so I didnt have to spend much time in the room  This hotel is NOT worth the price  I would definately not be staying here again  The ONLY plus is location but there are better hotels for the same price to chose from  My advise stay elsewhere  
N => Perfect Location We stayed at Inn of Chicago on a Saturday night and felt for the  price we paid it was a good value  The room was adequate but the bathroom was super small  Only room for  person in there at a time  The first room we were assigned to had not been cleaned so upon going back down to front desk we were reassigned a room  This was the only negative of the experience  Would recommend for its location and price  
N => Never again I sat in the lobby for an hour waiting for my room which was reserved a month prior to my arrival  While sitting there I watched them turn away people who were not  even though they already paid for their room via the internet and a few other travelers for just plain stupid reasons  I dont think they want repeat business   they didnt even seem to care  After all my attempts to get my reservation resolved and I got to my room it was small and not that clean  My room was reserved through my company so I didnt have a choice   but if I did I would have left and gotten a room elsewhere before I even seen the room  I was not impressed with the service  That left a bad taste in my mouth  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone else and I will never go there again when I return to the city  
N => Worst Service Hotel should be shut down The hotel turned us down because we were not  years of age we are  years of age  I had confirmed a fews days before we traveled the  hours to Chicago and everything was fined UNTIL WE ARRIVED  They denied us our hotel room because we were not  when they are clearly are unaware that the legal age in the U S  is   They said it was hotel policy  This quotpolicyquot is no where to be found on their website  They even printed us a false page from their website that stated we had to be   I then called the hotel a few days later and the man I spoke with on the phone admitted that it is not on their website  They refused to let us speak with any sort of manager while we were checking  They refused to give us a phone book to book another stay with another hotel and stated that all the hotels in the Chicago area had the same policy  This information was also false we booked our week long stay with a hotel  blocks away DO NOT STAY AT THE INN OF CHICAGO  They dont care about their customers or customer loyalty and they clearly dont care about the revenue coming in the front door from their customers  If you ask me they are getting their revenue from illegal activities  
N => Good for budget travelers Our room on the fifth floor was much smaller than we expected and had no closet to speak of  Room had no orations and a poor view of construction across the street  Bathroom was very small but had recently been reated and had modern fixtures  Room was also very noisy On the other hand the hotel staff was great  We had a problem with our first room and they were able to move us to another room very quickly even on a Saturday night  The bellhops were courteous and had a secure room for us to store our luggage before check in and after check out  We had a park and stay package  No problems with the valet although our car sat on the street for quite a while because we arrived at noon check out time and the hotel was very busy Great location   one block from Michigan Ave Magnificent Mile We will try another hotel next time though  
N => Great locationlousy service Just returned from a  night stay  First I agree about the great location tiny bathroom and small rooms  Our room were clean and comfortable Regarding customer service it is abysmal  I called the hotel a month before our stay and asked for accomodations for my wife and I and our two adult children  She suggested two adjoining queen bed rooms  I agreed and they confirmed the reservation When we checked in we were assigned two rooms but they were not adjoining  The desk clerk told me that the reservation clerk had quotmisinformedquot me that their hotel had no adjoining rooms  She also said the desk quotdoesnt getquot the reservation information from the reservation clerks so she was unaware of any promises the reservation clerk had made  I had my copy printed outWhen we got to our rooms we noticed that one of them had a door into the next room locked from the other side of course  I went back to the desk and asked to see the manager  He apologized to me that the desk clerk had told me there were no adjoining rooms  I asked him to assign a set to me but he said none of them were queens  I asked why they didnt have  queens reserved for me  He told me that my reservation was just a quotrequestquot that they try to honor them but cant always  I pointed our that I had made my reservations a month ago  He countered with some nonsense about quotunpredictable occupancy ratesquot  These people made no apology for this gaffe and made no attempt to make it right even Red Roof will do that When I checked out I made a point to do so in person  The clerk on duty told me I quotdidnt need toquot didnt thank me and didnt ask how my stay was My impression of the Inn of Chicagos customer service is incompetence miscommunication and they couldnt care less  
N => Nice hotel with terrible plumbing My husband and I just returned from a two night stay at the Inn of Chicago  We were thrilled with the location and the rate of night on hotwire com  This is an old hotel that has been very nicely and fashionably remodeled  When we arrived and asked for a king bed we were told they didnt have any but they upgraded us to a quotior suitequot to make up for it  We thought was very generous considering that we hadnt requested the king bed ahead of time We were very happy with the first room we were given Room  until we flushed the toilet which we quickly learned was broken  We called the front desk and were immediately moved to another suite three floors down Room   This was a minor inconvenience but promptly and courteously handled  This room had a functioning toilet but lacked a plug for the bathtub and worse the shower made a horrible screeching sound and produced only a trickle of water  The next morning when we complained they installed a plug for the bathtub but did not fix the shower  On our last morning there was no hot water an issue we were told was affecting the entire hotel My recommendation stay here only if you plan not to use the bathroom during your stay  
N => Run far away from this place So I book  rooms using Priceline  After I saw the hotels website I thought this would be the perfect place to stay  I called a week ahead of my scheduled stay to confirm that both rooms would have  double beds  I was assured they would  When we got there to check in there were two people standing at the desk but only one was checking people in  After waiting for about  minutes the woman who was just standing there finally ided she would check some people in  When I FINALLY got up there I asked if both my rooms had two beds  She looked at me like I was insane  I told her I had called a week before gave her the name of the person I spoke with  She said that it wasnt in the system  I asked her if she could find two rooms with double beds and she acted as if I asked for her first born child  Finally she said she could do it but that the rooms would be on different floors I said fine  Well imagine my surprise when I went to the rooms and discovered that one had two beds and the other only had one  At that point I was so livid I couldnt even go back downstairs  Well after I finally got out of that place imagine my surprise when my account was negative because even though I had paid priceline two weeks before my actual stay the hotel ided they would CHARGE ME AGAIN  So I had a bad experience with the hotel in the first place and now they have double charged me for the rooms  LOVELY  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy  I would rather stay the night in a homeless shelter  
N => Satisfactory Stay I just came back from a weekend trip in Chicago and stayed at the Inn of Chicago for two nights  Overall I am satisfied with the stay The best thing about this place is the location Other than the fact that its so closely located to Michigan ave  aka the magnificent mile it has a seven  right across the street for late night needs including water since there was no mini bars available in any of the three rooms we visited you will soon see how we ended up with three rooms in three days  It also has Dunkin for coffeebagellate night snack and Pompeis for bread and excellent pizza which can also be delivered to your room for a delivery fee of  From those of you traveling from the airport you can take the cta train for  one way  Its a   minutes ride  The hotel is a  minute walk from the Jackson red station As someone else mentioned this is not a five star hotel  You get what you pay  Rooms are clean and small but livable  Bathrooms are small but usable and relatively clean  The bed we used was quite comfortable and the pillows clean  My friend arrived early pm but was able to check in upon arrival  Early check in is possible Finally we did have some problem with our heater and had to move around twice to finally get a warm room  Read on if you are interested in what happened but bottom line problem solved after  hours Our room was in the s and when we arrived and was not warming up  We didnt want to waste our time waiting for someone to fix the problem so I called the front desk to let them know of the problem  This was around pm  We came back around pm to an ice cold room  I called the front desk again and they immediately sent their maintenance  We waited for about half an hour at which time I called the front desk again  They told me that they were looking into the option of fixing the heater or giving us a new room  I would have appreciated it if they would have followed up on me  I was quite upset by this time I had just spent four hours in the single digit cold  The Assistant Front Desk Manager Ellis offered to change our room and brought up the key to our room  Unfortunately our second room was warmer but not warm enough  We eventually moved to a third room by pm and was able to unpack Ellis was kind enough to give us a discount for our first night and two free drinks at the hotel lounge  He also came by to the lounge and made sure we were doing okay  I appreciated his service  
N => Good Hotel at a Great Value This was a good hotel  Rooms were clean and service was great  The staff was friendly and helpful  It was also very close to the magnificent mile and bus lines which was great 
N => Inn of Chicago Inn of Chicago was alright but it needs some fixing up I came here on a business trip and I wish I had gone to a different hotel I will not be going back  
N => need to learn some manners Its taken me a while to get around to this review but my anger at the way myself and my girlfriend were treated during our stay has yet to abate   even during the holiday period We were checked in by a middle aged receptionist who really needs to learn some manners  From the get go she made it feel like it was a chore to even book us in   her excuse was that the computers at the front of the hotel were down We had booked a deluxe suite getting a deal on the internet  Upon hearing this she had the temerity to suggest I doubt that they are  a night Granted we are no high rollers but we are thirtysomething professionals and felt a tad offended  Once we went up to our suite we discovered it was anything but deluxe  even the faucetsor taps were broken in the bathroom  and the promise of a hottub turned out to be false  it was barely even a bath We were pretty exhausted having travelled up from st louis that afternoon so didnt bother complaining  doubt the woman at reception would have paid us any attention anyway Ive stayed in a lot of hotels and I must say this was the worst experience I ever had in over  years of travelling The bell staff were very nice and helpful but hardly made up for the rudeness of their front of house staff Chicago is a class city one of my favourite Ive ever been in but dont stay here My girlfriend even e mailed the hotel when we arrived back in Ireland but she just got a standard response with apology which was appreciated but hardly made up for all the problems  
N => Great Location My family and I stayed here over Black Friday  The location couldnt be beat half way between Water Tower Place to the north and Millenium Park to the south  The free trolley to Navy Pier was  block away  We found the staff to be courteous and very helpful  The room was of ordinary size and the beds were very comfortable  The bathroom was very small  Since we were there to shop and sleep we were very pleased  A small refrigerator would have been nice tho 
N => Clean hotel incompetent staff Rooms were clean hotel lobby and small bar had a pleasant ambiance  Bathrooms were very small  Very central location  Only problem was room assignment  Through the booking website   single vs double was not guaranteed  However I called the hotel once I got my confirmation and was assured of what I had wanted  Upon arrival my room type was not available and I was told to try for my second night  Called front desk at am and was again assured my request would be filled in the afternoon  Came down at am to again confirm and said that I wouldnt be back till after pm   again assured that my request would be filled without any problems  When I came back there was no note on my file of my request and AGAIN had to wait till the next day All in all I spoke to  different people on  different occasions with each time telling me that it wouldnt be a problem with no results Either    they were lying to me when they said my request could be fullfilled or    they have staff that is woefully incompent  
N => Perfect location After reading other reviews I was a little leary of staying here but I found it to be a very pleasant surprise  It was a great place to stay for a long weekend with my  year old  On check in they said they were over booked they only had a room with a queen bed so I ended up sharing it with my son  The check in was quick and smooth staff pleasant  Yes the rooms are abit small but it was fine clean maids changed towels everyday  We were in the room next to the fitness center  Others who stayed in this room complained about the noise but I never heard anyone use the equipment  Bathroom was small but the shower was fine  Only complaint was cable movies were out and it was taking them a few days to get someone out This place is a perfect location a block off Michigan ave walking distance to most everything the free trolly to Navy pier is a block over  If you are looking for a place to stay for a long weekend of shopping it cant be beat  
N => very small rooms the inn of Chicago had a very comfortable bed and the lobby was very nice  the bathroom was so small you could not walk once in the bathroom you could only turn around  the parking fee was not listed on the website so i called and was told one fee and upon arrival i was told a ten dollar higher fee  there was some confusion about the valet tickets each time you called for your car the attendants did not seem to really know what was going on  the elevator could hold only three people and only two with luggage  when checking out i noticed that i was charged for two days of valet parking but the mistake was corrected without any problem  i would not stay at the inn of Chicago and i would not recommend it to anyone  
N => Small Rooms Good Location We stayed at this hotel for one night during the week of tember th  The rooms were much smaller than what they were portrayed on line but it was nice to be so close to the Magnificent mile  Unless youre going to be using Valet parking   thats extremely inconvenient   and costly  The service was okay  were pretty simple people so we dont require much the front desk lady when we checked in was very courteous  One negative in the service was that our room did not have wash cloths in them we called the front desk and they said they would send them right up    hours later we went to the front desk and got them ourselves  
N => inn of chicago For the price and the location this is an excellent choice  The available parking was below average price the hotel price was very reasonable and our experience was very pleasant  We were a bit nervous about some poor reviews but upon checking in but once we saw our rooms we were happy to see that the rooms werent really that small and yeah the bathroom was small but it served us fine We love Chicago and this is our first choice from now on 
N => Pleasantly surprised We just returned from our Chicago trip and felt we had to write our own review of the Inn of Chicago  We booked our stay and were prepared for the worst after reading all of the negative reviews  We are so glad we took the chance because our experience was purely positive We arrived early Friday morning and approached the front desk with the intent of asking them to hold our luggage while we had lunch and did some shopping before check in  It was before  a m  and we were informed that our rooms were ready and we could check in  We were pleasantly surprised and proceeded to our rooms  Again we were not expecting much due to the reviews but our room was very adequate  We were in a double room we had  in our party and still had plenty of room with the table  chairs dresser and wardrobe  The bathroom was small but this is an older hotel  It was very clean had good water pressure and our room was quiet at the end of the hall  Our friends were a few doors down and their room was a little smaller than ours making it a little more cramped for  people  If traveling with more than  people I would definitely request one of their larger rooms  The floor layout map showed that the rooms are of slightly varying sizes The location was wonderful so close to everything  The concierge was most helpful and pleasant  We would absolutely stay here again  Note if you are looking for a fantastic meal try the Grand Lux Cafe around the corner  The portions are generous so split the meal they encourage this and save room for one of their wonderful desserts 
N => Horrible Customer Service We tried to check in on Friday y th  Stood in a long line to check in  We were greeted with a quotName and ID pleasequot   After a lengthy process of checking in we were told that our room was not ready and would not be for several hours  Even though it was after   We had dinner plans and were seeing a show so we told them that we would not be back until late and they assured us that we would still have the room that we requested   a room with two double beds there were  of us  As I looked around the lobby I saw dozens of people with their luggage waiting to get into their rooms  When we returned that evening we were rudely given our keys  When I got up to our room I discovered they gave us a king room  When I called the front desk to ask for the room they were supposed to give us I was told that due to our late check in our room was given away  I told him that I checked in earlier in the afternoon and was promised a room with  double beds  He said there were no other rooms available  I said well what do you suggest we do and he said nothing he could do  Then I reqeusted a cot be sent up and he said quotoh I guess we could send up a cotquot  The bathroom was very tiny  No place to put anything  At  am we were awaked by a phone call from security telling me that my food was down in the lobby  I told him I didnt order food and he said he called the wrong room  When we went to check out and complained to the front desk about our accomodations they were not even apologetic  She told us that it was a busy weekend in Chicago and we should have gotten to our room earlier  Oh brother  Yes the price was lower than most other hotels in the area   you get what you pay for  While we were waiting to check out in the lobby we heard most people grumbling about their experience at the hotel  The staff could not have been ruder  I plan on contacting Best Western about my experience  
N => Pleasant Experience at Inn of Chicago I was pleased with my experience at Inn of Chicago  The hotel staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful  The rooms were not very big no big surprise in these older hotels however they were clean and just big enough for a short stay  I would not recommend more than two people to a room  The only other problem was that the bathroom had no vent so it could get a little stuffy in the room after showering  The location was fabulous  Overall on a scale of  to  I would give this hotel a   
N => Long time patron   disappointed Inn of Chicago has been my first choice for a place to stay since the mid s and I have always loved it  Its been about six years since my last visit to Chicago and I was so suprised and disappointed with the deterioration of service at the hotel during my recent visit  I waited for close to an hour to get checked in  The toilet in our room didnt work properly and quit flushing  In the bathroom theres no counter space to put your stuff  My keys didnt work in the door on the second day so I had to stand in another long line almost an hour again while my sister and her two kids ate dinner in the hall outside our room  While standing in line to get new keys at approx   pm I watched three families check in and be told that there was not a clean room to give them they would have to wait in the lobby or go have dinner and come back  The desk workers were also calling other people over the intercom to tell them that their room was now ready  Im not sure what happened to the management of this hotel and why Best Western has allowed it to deteriorate this badly  This patron will be looking at other option in the future  
N => Where did they spend millions in reations This hotel was advertised on their own hotel web site as having just quotcompleted a multi million dollar reation of our lobby bar meeting space and guest rooms at this landk Chicago hotel quot Im still trying to figure out where they spent their money  While the lobby and bar looked quotnewerquot it certainly wasnt worth touting  And I have no idea where they spent the money in the rooms as they did not look quotnewly reatedquot  Paint on the windows was slapped on the carpet was soiled and tattered along the edges the furniture was cheap looking AND the halls and rooms reeked of disinfectants  I had to change rooms something I never do several times to find one I could at least spend the night in  This was more like a motel in a tall building rather than an actual hotel with few amenities or comforts  I would have expected this for  a night but for    which I was charged   I was NOT pleased  There is a small bar and a fireplace in the lobby otherwise you need to walk to eat pick up snacks or personal items  The bathing products they offered were an odd mix of quotBest Westernquot soaps and several different brands of shampoo conditioner and lotions  Two good things that I can say is that management was kind and helpful AND it is a good location for getting around the downtown area  But considering my experience   Id rather stay someplace else to get around especially at those prices  I would have left if I didnt pre pay and there was any availability  This place is really trying to be a fancy chic boutique of some sort   and they didnt even come close  
N => Simply Horrible I was greeted the front desk with friendly a hello and was treated with a dry scripted quotI will need your credit card drivers license quot Strike one The receptionist continued this unpleasant experience by telling me that the hotel was being bought by private investors  After feeling thoroughly insulted I made to my small room where the electrical plugs were put into extension cords like on the Christmas Story  The lamp on the desk has a short and the maintenance guy failed to replace it  Final straw came when I wanted to go out  I was instructed that valet is not hours as I was lead to believe but was till p  I had to retrieve my vehicle from the par king lot down the street  But by doing so I have to pay everytime I get the car since the hotel has no INOUT service  Advice take cabs and expect to be unimpressed or research for another hotel  I found a star for a few dollars more per night  
N => Emergency cancellation Beware From ine in Iowa I was very pleased with the room the location and especially the service at the Inn of Chicago in ruary  The staff members   the bell hop and others   went out of their way to be helpful I was extremely disappointed however that my friend whose flight was cancelled because of winter storms did not receive a refund My dhter amp I had planned to meet our friends at Inn of Chicago and stay      Unfortunately they were unable to fly into Chicago because of blizzards in New York  They were told that we could not stay in the room that they had reserved and even though they were unable to get to Chicago that they would not receive a refund for those four nights  Im not sure which is more guilty Orbitz or the Inn So beware travelers 
N => Convenient clean affordable   but dont expect much I had the read the reviews about the construction going on at the hotel prior to booking a room for  nights  And yes there was major construction going on at the time we stayed  In fact when we walked in on a Sunday night there wasnt a lick of furniture in the lobby and people were sitting on the window ledges with their laptops accessing Wi Fi  The next morning a shipment of furniture arrived in the lobby and was set up and functional by that evening  Since we were just planning on using the room as a quotbase campquot as we explored Chicago for a couple of days with our  amp  year old it worked out fine  Cons Our room was small and dark just enough room for  double beds the pillows and bed were not the highest quality  Also it was missing the typical paperwork you find in a hotel booklets tv guide amp do not distub sign  No night lights   even in the light switches  And we were on the rd floor and only had a view of the fire escape  Pros Clean affordable for the convenient location very handy to downtown across the street from a quik t to grab breakfastsnacks very helpful staff  Our experience with the staff was above what was expected from previous reviewers   we found them to be very helpful and courteous on all the occassions we had to contact them noisy neighbors needing a do not distub sign needing fresh towels since we missed room service with the do not disturb sign  Also we had left some items in the room which they found and we had them shipped to us the next day  
N => After all the bad reviews it wasnt THAT bad I was surprised after all the horrible reviews to see that the hotel wasnt a complete hole  My brother booked the hotel and I checked here to see how it rated  I was expecting to come into a rediculously bad room but it was just more of a joke than anything  The bathroom is about the size of the closet the bed was too close to the dresser and you couldnt open it and the stairs were closed  Other than that it wasnt too bad The rooms were fairly clean dusty but tidy at least and the bed was comfortable  Considering we were doing a lot of sight seeing and were hardly at the hotel it was perfect  
N => Hated this hotel This hotel was horrible  I will admit the location was fantastic   one block off of Michigan Avenue  The hotel was a dump  The bellman were rude and inconsiderate the front desk staff was obviously not happy with their job and it showed the hotel was under construction which was not posted on the Best Western website   the entire experience was a bad one  We lost power and had to sit in the dark while trying to get ready for a conference for about a forty five minutes and the staff was unhelpful and rude  We received one apology after we called three times to report our problem  One staff member lied to us   so if you are looking for customer service   GO SOMEPLACE ELSE We tried to report the problem to Best Western International   still nothing    I have contacted the manager and still no reply   and it has been two weeks now  This hotel lacks professionalism customer service and a welcoming environment I want to make sure that other fellow business and leisure travelers do not get stuck in this hotel 
N => Work Site with rude staff Was in Chicago for a few nights booked this hotel cuz the location was close to the nightlife which it was  but when got into the taxi the taxi man told us this hotel was closed down we got him to take us to the address anyway  When we got to the hotel it looked like it was shut but it wasnt the hotel is undergoing major works it really should be closed down while the works are on or at least i should have been told when making the booking  Something that really annoyed me was when we were checked in we were given a sheet of paper letting us know that they were really happy we were staying with them during this historic time    we didnt like it and was very annoyed the staff were not freindly behind the desk at all  
N => Dirty hotel poor service I was extremely unhappy with the service I received at this hotel  I do not generally write reviews of hotels  Who has the time I have traveled all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels  I really felt strongly that I needed to let others know that they should avoid this horrific experience  The location of the hotel is good  My main issue was that the hotel was not clean  When I arrived at my room I found hairs all over the toilet  When I informed the management and asked to be moved they appeared disinterested  After wating several hours they finally agreed to move me to another room  At this point it was almost midnight  I moved all my belongings myself as the management refused to help me move  When I got to the second room I found that all the television would show was snow no picture  Only a few minutes later I saw a bedbug run across my bed  I was absolutely horrified  When I immediately called the management the manager came to my room and agreed to move me yet again  Again he did nothing to assist me in moving at am  The third room they provided was adequate and without vermin  However I though the building was extremely unsanitary and the service poor  I told management that I expected a refund or at least a discount  The manager refused to do either  As I said I have stayed at many many hotels and this was clearly the worst experience I have ever had  Save yourself the horror and stay elsewhere  
N => Good choice for Chicago We checked in for  nights y amp the hotel was full amp very busy  Although our room looked onto a wall it was clean comfortable  The location is awesome  min walk to Michigan Ave min walk to Lake amp min walk to Subway station  Recommended for pricelocation  
N => One word to describe horrible  Best  Western more like  Worst  Western  We tried to check into the hotel at  in the afternoon we were told that our room was not ready  When we asked approximately how long it would take for our room  We were told to step aside and they would let us know  After waiting for  minutes in a crowded lobby along with all the other hotel guest and their luggage we were told that it was going to be  minutes to an hour until our room was ready  The baggage check was over filled so we had to take our luggage with us to a nearby restaurant  Just what you want to do when you get off a plane is walk the streets with your luggage  Fortunately we were able to book a room at a nearby Hyatt  When we returned to the Best Western we informed the front desk that we would not be staying  We expressed how disappointed we were at the situation and that never once was an apology given  The person at the front desk told us that all the hotels in the area were booked and that we would have this problem anywhere we went  We informed the  lady  that we had just booked a room at the Hyatt  Her response  good then go there   Unbelievable I know that this is not the Drake or the W but a little customer service goes a long way even for a Best Western  
N => Great location  not great hotel and horrible service First the positive  it was a great location right next to Michigan Ave  and Chicago is a rockin city Tons o fun Negatives  the staff is super unfriendly  We arrived at pm to check in and our room was still not ready  We had a concert to get going to so we had to leave without checking into our room  They were NOT accomodating and made no excuses  We needed to change our clothes and we forced to do so in the lobby bathroom  We checked our baggage behind the desk and when we came back to claim it at midnight they gave us the run around and the jerk of a sercurity gaurd just about would not give us our bags The rooms were okay but nothing to write home about  I would not stay here again  You can do better with a different downtown hotel  My husband and I came to the conclusion that the Inn of Chicago is definitely a quothas beenquot hotel  
N => RoomPrice Major Mismatch Just got back from a business trip to Chicago  Apparently this was one of THOSE weekends where ALL hotels fill up and the hotels can charge whatever they want  Although this was booked  weeks prior to the trip it was about the last thing available for this trip  Nothing at the hotel was really BAD but it all felt very bad because of the price of the room  We ended up paying rates at or above those of the riott or Doubletree for this very basic motel  Even at Chicago rates this hotel is not worth more than night  We paid more than double that The rooms are very dated including the airconditioning which kicks onoff all night  Light sleepers beware  The bathroom is very old  We were on the st floor and had no water pressure in the shower  The wi fi available in rooms on the th floor and above worked fine  The rooms seemed clean  Check in was very slow and appeared to be very manual  The staff was pleasant enough but it took forever  Once checked in one of the people in our party received a call and said that they quotaccidently booked him into the wrong roomquot and would he move into another room  The room they were offering was a quotparlorquot with a sofa bed  When he asked if they were offering it at the same ridiculous price they said YES  Of course he said NO The elevators are very small and can hold only  or  people  Although credit card numbers were taken at checkin for quotincidentalsquot the sundry shop wouldnt allow one in our party to charge a couple of batteries to his room  He had no cash with him so he pulled out his credit card  Sorry  minimum purchase to use the credit card    batteries were   So he threw in some k food to get the bill up to  to be able to buy the batteries Today when we went to take the car out of the parking garage the hotel wanted CASH  Again no charging to the room or even credit card  So we scraped up the  for two nights parking and paid the cash Last thing Ill say is that the location is fine  But I wouldnt stay there again for business or pleasure for anything over   And believe me I am used to budget hotels but I expect to pay budget prices  
N => Other than location not good If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel right off of the Miracle Mile and dont care about the following problems then choose this hotel  We were disappointed  Here are the problems they should fix     The water coming out of the taps should not be intermittent with bursts of air   The water coming out of the shower should not cause injury  It bursts out of those cheap inoperable nozzles at an incredible rate  We took ours completely off and the water gushing directly from the pipe in the wall was an improvement   The pop machine should dispense cold soda not hot   The tv volume should be loud enough to hear    The guys at the door should be helpful   The concierge while knowledgable should be nice as well  She seemed irritated to have to repeat herself  Im sorry if we didnt feel like getting on the wrong bus I wouldnt stay here again  Chicago itself was awesome though   very safe and fun  
N => Worst Western I stayed at the BW Inn of Chicago over the weekend of il th   Firstly the location is excellent but thats it  I paid around  for two nights and wish Id paid more to stay somewhere nicer  On arrival around pm so quite early I asked for a room with a city or lake view as it was my first visit to Chicago  After searching the system for a little while I was given room   We went up to drop our bags off and have a quick look at the view    it was of the fire escape steps and not much more  We went up to the roof terrace as it was a lovely day    closed  We ided to go walk on our way out we asked at reception for another room On our return we checked the room situation we hadnt been moved and all rooms had been allocated quotcheck in the morningquot we were told  We did nothing had been done the guy asked what room we had when I told him quotthats the fire escape leave it with mequot the guy said  That first night was awful rowdy people partying getting ice etc  it was like the door was made of balsa  We had a great day in a great city and returned to the hotel late in the afternoon on our second day you guessed it nothing had been done  We had a second night that was even rowdier than the first it was hellish  Pay more and enjoy a great city 
N => Find another hotel and pay the extra  Location is good but thats the best thing to say about this hotel  The homeless begging outside the main street doors was aggravating at times Staff not over accommodating  Until I told them I was a Best Western Frequent traveler no extra enthusiasm  We then received breakfast coupons Room and hallways small  Our room had a bad smell and had to buy a candle to deodorize All in all a bad experience for a first trip to Chicago Sorry to say Spend the extra  and stay at the riott down the street seemed worth the extra expense  
N => Nice hotel but                        We stayed at The Inn of Chicago for  nights in mid ober   The staff were good to deal with not overly friendly but professional in their approach with customers  The rooms were superb wed booked two doubles and were huge and spotlessly clean  However on check out we vacated our rooms at pm and brought our bags to the lobby  We were offered the service of minding our bags by the bellhops the guys with the blue jacketswhile we went for lunch before leaving for O Hare at pm  I enquired as to the cost of this and was informed    which I thought was a little expensive but we had a lot of bags and couldnt bring them with us so we accepted their offer  On collection we asked them to organise a cab to the airport which they did we paid the    to another of the bellhops who was overly thankful insofar as he asked was this for the taxi fare  Needless to say the penny dropped and we felt ripped off  Anyway a taxi pulled up outside the door we gathered our bags and went outside and the bellhop nearly broke his neck running out after us to tell us that this wasnt ours and hed ordered a mini van for our comfort  This duly arrived and we loaded up this quotmini vanquot was smaller than the cab we got from the airport  days earlier  On arrival at O Hare we asked the fare as our driver had neglected to switch on the meter and were informed       more than the fare  days beforehand  RIPPED OFF AGAIN  The bottom line is I would stay in this hotel again but the dealings with the bellhops left me with a bad taste in my mouth and they tainted what was up to then a very enjoyable stay  I did complain to the hotel on my arrival home and while they did acknowledge my email Im still waiting for a response on the hotels position on my experience  
N => It was       nice It was in a prime location  My boyfriend and I almost passed it because I thought it was further out of downtown  The room was clean and comfy  But the ice machine was right outside our door so you can hear everyone getting ice  The soda machine needed to be fixed but the staff will happily give you a refund  I would definitely stay here again  A little pricey for me Im use to staying in smaller cities but worth it  
N => great location but    the location of this hotel was great but the room was horrible  it was so small the water pressure was terrible the room temp went from hot to cold so often you couldnt sleep  the only good thing about our stay was that we were allowed to check in early without any problems  i excepted a little better out of the best western hotel chain and would not stay here again when i visit chicago  
N => Unhelpful Staff We stayed here for  days at the end of il and the hotel was completely adequate for our needs  Not the best quality or best looking but we didnt book the hotel with this in mind  We wanted somewhere cheap and central and that is exactly what we got  The location is perfect for shopping on the Magnificent Mile and downtown can be easily reached in a brief walk  However the major problem with this hotel are the staff and their attitude  We arrived just before pm which is check in time  We were allowed to register but told to return just after pm to pick up our keys which is fine  We return to the desk just after pm to be told our room is not ready and can we return later  I asked when we should return and they said in mins   mins later I returned to the desk the room still was not ready as the housekeeping staff had not cleaned it yet although they are definitely dealing with it now  When I asked what time it would be ready I was told they couldnt give me a time They did not know exactly when it would be ready and they have no control over when housekeeping clean the room  We were told this by  unhelpful staff who suggested we go for a walk do some shopping grab some dinner etc  They said come back in an hour and it should be ready  We did as we were told and returned  hours later    guess what    the room still wasnt ready and again they said they couldnt tell us exactly when it would be ready and again told us to go shopping grab some dinner  They said there were no other rooms available and they didnt know for sure when our room would be cleaned and couldnt give us an exact time of when to return   hours after arriving and watching plenty of other people check in completely fed up now of being messed around we stood our ground and said we werent prepared to put up with this and advised them we would find another hotel to stay at  Suddenly a room became available not the one we booked but the penthouse suite was available We ended up staying in a huge room much bigger than we needed but we got a room in the end although it was a massive struggle  The staff our completely unhelpful unfriendly impolite and unwilling to smile until you start to complain and then they will suddenly start to do their job  We didnt liase with them at all for the rest of the trip as we didnt want to risk a repeat performance  I hope you have better luck with them than we did 
N => Great Service  Booked with an online discounter for a great rate  I was worried wed get a basement room by the boiler but we got a corner room on   It was a pretty large room larger than most on the floor from the map by the elevator  Yes the bathroom is a little small but we go to a lot of bed amp breakfast homes amp weve travelled a lot in Europe so believe me I have seen bathrooms WAY smaller than this It is an older hotel so the lobby is small the elevators are way small but the location is so close amp convenient to so many things  Close to the free trolley amp bus stop as well  Cant imagine a more central location The staff was incredible  They told us what busses to catch they called the museum for us to get the Labor Day hours different than what is published  They arranged transport to the airport for us came outside to make sure we were getting the right cab loaded our luggage into the cab amp refused to take a tip  We checked out at am amp our flight didnt leave until pm  They held our luggage for us all day amp again refused a tip The rooms have been updated in the last few years amp we found them very clean amp tastefully orated  Beds were comfy enough   I usually have a hard time sleeping in hotel beds but I slept like the dead AC was blocked by the curtains so I had to prop something against the curtains to keep them from billowing amp blocking the cool air  Rooftop k was OK   nice view  One thing we liked   since there was no pool seems there were also no kids  Were child free so it was nice not to have kids running around all over the halls amp lobby This is by no means a luxury hotel but its certainly no TravelLodge either  Id stay there again in a heartbeat  
N => Great Price and Location Great location right off Michigan Ave  The price was great  We booked directly with the hotel  The el train was about two blocks away  It was a short enough distance that we walked with our luggage to the hotel  The room was small but clean and neat  Our friends were booked next door  Everything was just as I expected   The restaurant directly across the street is not just a greasy spoon  It was a delicious place and orated very tastefully it was a place where the locals go  We ate breakfast there on Sunday morning  The food was served to us quickly by a friendly and efficient waitress  
N => Excellent Just a little small  
N => Wonderful Experience  
N => hotel assez bien   en travaux   mais sans room service   bien plac   
N => Average Hotel All Dressed Up Modern or felt cold rather than luxurious The staff was very friendly to me Very clean but sparse room  Spacious and new bathroom  I had a great city view All in all I wouldnt pay more than  a night to stay here  
N => An open letter to the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago This morning I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences Ive ever had Hard Rock Hotel Chicago I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the quotPreferred Hotelsquot group Upon checking in I was quotgreetedquot by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show My room was poorly lit and dirty The deskdesk chair was covered in sticky dried soda pop or something else which I had to clean myself so I could work The quotsound systemquot was put to shame by my  year old dhters boombox No one rock star or otherwise wants to reach more than an arms length for toilet paper Everything is possible  This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the quoteverything is possiblequot line  Great keting fails with no follow through The in room mini bar policy ranks in my personal top five most ridiculous business practices of all time  Do you charge Steven Tyler   for opening his in room fridgeLooking back I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty drafty overpriced bar with a horrendous wine listWith the exception of the fact that I was leaving check out was no better than checking in  I wasnt even asked about my stay The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant I for one will not bring my business back to that location  Next time Im in Chicago Im staying at the Hyatt Rock on TripStarr 
N => Ill pass next time We stayed in Chicago for a getaway weekend  I was looking for something unique and choose this hotel  We upgraded to a midsize suite on the  something floor  To be honest I dont know why it was so expensive or what the quotwow factorquot was  The only difference I noticed was it had more trendy room amenities  However it was very similar to everything other hotel weve stayed  Nothing special  And dont eat at the restaurant downstairs It was horrible and overpriced  It was a waste of our time amp money  
N => Dark and cramped Hotel room was incredibly dark and small   as other reviewers have said  There was little storage space but it was convenient to downtown attractions  Our company placed our Philadelphia office here when we came to meet our Chicago counterparts so at least I didnt pay for the room  
N => Loved the experience at Hard Rock Hotel Chicago I had a fabulous experience at Hard Rock Hotel ChicagoI was treated like a VIP  Celebrity and made to feel special     my stay was private and quiet  was truly a queen for a dayCant wait to go back 
N => Excellent location  Hi I stayed at Hard Rock hotel the location is excellent you can walk to the park to restaurants to shopping malls  The room was clean and cosy the bed was good the view from the st floor was very nice  But there was no bathrobe no slippers the room had amenities for only  person but we were  the coffee machine was broken  I only paid half price and stayed only  night so I didnt really mind but I would not pay full price for it Enjoy  
N => wickedly wonderful We won a trip from a beer company the staff could not be any more helpful and friendly The concierge was quick to help us with a computer problem   he recommended places to visit and made sure we made it to places on time The room was roomy and we had a velous view I loved the bathroom and the shampoo and conditioner There is a bean bag room to relax in  I called this quotwickedly wonderful quot because we saw quotWickedquot which is walking distance to the theatre 
N => This hotel was  just okay  ask for a room with a view We just returned from a  night stay at this hotel  It was in a good location and just a fairly short walk from the subway  Also just a few blocks from Nordstroms and other great shopping on Michigan Ave However we didnt request a specific room when we checked in at  AM due to plane delays etc   We stayed in room  which had an quotinside viewquot of rooftops and into other rooms  If you stay here you should definitely ask for a room with a view  We had other friends there that had very nice rooms Our room was very very dark  And there was only minimal lighting    not enough for our preference  Hotel hallways were also quite dark and also fairly narrow The bed was very comfortable but other than that   our room was just quotaveragequot  It was not really worth the money in my opinion Hotel staff was also average not overly friendly  The hotel has an extremely modern feel to it which isnt exactly very quotwelcomingquot  However the guys greeting people hailing cabs etc at the hotel entrance were very friendly and helpful  
N => Not there yet    This Hard Rock property is not up to the normal quotvibequot that you would expect from the hotel chain  The staff seems to be trying hard but it will take some time before it reached the Hard Rock level of service  It lacks the vibe that of the W in Chicago and due to lack of space in the lobby and bar I doubt they will ever be able to match it  Rooms are very nice but when I commented that the room did not match the description on the website I was told that I had been put in a quotlower endquot Hard Rock suite  words you never want to hear My advise would be to give this property time to mature   and stay at the W for now  
N => Not very good The only good thing about the Hard Rock Hotel was the location  My wife and I stayed in a suite and were very unhappy  The hotel was VERY HOT  Everyone who worked for the Hard Rock gave the exact same answer as to why the rooms were hot  Because it is spring they have to switch the HVAC from heat to airconditioning             We pleaded with them to do it but they would not so our room was HOT Room was dirty and the carpet was stained  Staff was not very helpful  Valet gave us bad directions Hamburger and frenchfries were good and that is pretty much it  
N => Great time in Chicago Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago  The reviews I read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect  The location was perfect  The hotel was beautiful  Our view was awesome  The room was large enough and very clean  The bed was very comfy  The staff were helpful   especially the concierge Jared I couldnt find anything negative to say  If you want to stay in downtown Chicago   you cant go wrong with this cool hotel  
N => Just a few comments We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago the weekend of ch    We booked the room through Hotwire com and paid more than we usually do through Hotwire night but he Housewares Show was in town so rooms were at a premium  Just a few comments    most of the reviews say the rooms are dark   well they arent BRIGHT but there was sufficient task lighting to read or work and I thought the bathroom was very well lit  The or is very contemporary    some  like it and some  not but we thought it was fine  The room size isnt huge but bigger than a lot of hotel rooms Ive been in in Europe and New York  The bathroom was more than adequate and well appointed The main plus this hotel has is the location  Perfect for shopping on Michigan Ave or strolling through Millenium Park and the museum campus  Id stay here again without any hestitation if the price was right  
N => Worth it I have to say I read the reviews over amp over again before our trip   and I was a little scared to stay at this hotel  However I can say we loved the hotel   Location   wonderful a short stroll to the best shopping on Michigan Ave  A quick cab ride to just about anywhere Staff  could not have been more accomodating from the bellman to the bartender to the maid to the servers at China Grill Rooms   here is the only hitch  We visited in late  in the midst of a snowstorm  We are from the south and used to mild weather and very used to HEAT  But the rooms were hot as they could be  During our  night stay we had four rooms  Room   small and HOT  Thermostat would not go below   Told front desk and were quickly relocated even though they were overbooked to another room  Room    DO NOT stay in room   on any floor  These rooms although roomy and cool are sparsly orated and right beside the ice machine elevators and maid closet     and very very loud  As in we didnt sleep a wink  Room    moved back to th floor     beautiful view bigger room but HOT     with fan blowing snow outside and thermostat set on  degrees it remained  in the room  So I asked what to do    not for a room change and they immediately sent someone up with keys to a new room and even though we got an upgrade with each room change    they put us in a quothard rock roomquot  This room was HUGE private hallway leading into it views of michigan ave from multiple windows   including inside the shower Double armoires California King dual chaise lounge with ottomans and it was perfect temp  wise  As I said the staff could not have been better during all of this  We booked the entire trip    nights  airfare on travelocity and we ended up in a room with a rack rate of over half of our trip cost  Food   China grille is magnificent yet a little pricy if you are not used to it  We ate there twice because we loved it so much  Beware there are NO vending machines in this hotel  But there is a walgreens  ft from the hotel a corner bakery a block away a Bennigans across the street Giordanos deep dish pizza across the Street     just about anything Bar   good drinks    hard to get a seat at the bar itself but plenty of seating on couches throughout the lobby area  All in all we loved the hotel the beds the room and everything  This was my th leisure trip to the city in the past  years and my most enjoyable stay  Past stays were at the Wyndham downtown W Lakeshore Intercontinental and the Hyatt  
N => Not worth   a night Stayed at HR Hotel for New Years   Priceline com accepted my offer   a night  I was some what suprised after looking on the HR website to see cheapest room listed at    Read several reviews that said the staff was rude  I didnt experience this at all  The parking was expensive   a night  I stayed  nights and for some reason they only charged me for   Location was great  Lighting in the actual hotel room was not very good  With all lights turned on I still felt like I was in the dark  
N => Great beds worn out hotel I would like to tell anyone thinking about staying at this hotel that the beds are great the staff was helpful but the hotel its self was run down there were large gouges in the walls in our room the room we had was very small and everything was soo dark i am a younger person and thought it would be a hip fun place to stay and i was wrong There are many other hotels in the area that have great beds great service great staff and MUCH better rooms the price was over rated too I usually do not complain about things but i just want people to know you would probably be better off spending your money on something else 
N => bad beginning   great ending My fiancee and I went for two nights this past ch  I dont recall what we paid being so long ago but I remember it was at least   dollars cheaper than other nice hotels in town  Our first night was not so great  The small room was very nice but happened to be right next to the elevator and the frequent quotdingquot coming from it really disturbed our sleep  The next morning the desk was happy to give us a room on a high floor with a great view away from the elevator but I ided to push my luck and pressed them to give us a suite  After a few minutes of speaking with the manager he rolled his eyes AND GAVE ME THE SUITE It was amazing   huge with wraparound floor to cieling windows  inch plasma tv basically the works  So the moral of the story is ask for a room away from the elevator although it worked out well for me 
N => Chicago Hard Rock Hotel Horrible experience Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see  The room we had at almost  a night was dingy and small  Dont mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there it isnt  They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items  The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods  When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasnt a choice  The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the  am choice and they refused to make it untill again we called the Manager who did get it to us  The staff did appear friendly although housekeeping totally disregarded our do not disturb sign and would call us on the phone  Dont make the mistake of staying here but if you do walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is  plus   gratuity  We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us  This is the most overpriced over rated and dingy hotel weve ever stayed in  Taxi to airport is   
N => Fine but     Ok first I must say I booked through a web site    After bidding on my hotel I realized that there was an additional  per night charge on the amout of offer so we didnt get as good of a deal as we had thought  That being said I enjoyed my stay at the Hard Rock  The staff was very nice but yes you dont get something for nothing like at other hotels  Free upgrade No  Free anything well no  The hotel has a great location  We never ate at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food  The room is pretty small  To be honest for a hard rock hotel I expected the room to be more themed  We had a picture of Steven Tyler and John Lennon and Yoko Ono  It just didnt make sence  I thought the hotel was fine but given the price of fine we will try something else next time  
N => Bait and switch on double beds Booked a room for double occupancy  Called ahead and requested  beds and was told there was a  up charge but they would put down by request  At check in the rude manager Rod Sall insisted that it was standard quotin Chicagoquot to provide only a king bed for two people  He offered to discount the upcharge to  for  beds  There are  rooms here but he wouldnt budge  and no the hotel is not busy at this time  I am a lawyer for  years have traveled extensively never encountered this situation  Manager was totally inflexible  Assigned us to a room next to ice machine elevator and the employees lounge  This is classic quotbait and switchquot   not the level of satisfaction I expected  very disappointing management  
N => Adequate but not for the business traveler I stayed one night at the Hard Rock in a standard double room  I chose the hotel because a block of rooms had been reserved for the rate of   I have stayed in the Hard Rock Las Vegas at least six times and liked it very much  This hotel was barely adequate  I like good contemporary or but this room was dark and rather depressing  Everything was some shade of gray including bedcovers which would have been fine if there had been ent lighting  The lighting was terrible  Do not expect to get any work done in your room unless you bring your own lamp  I called down to the front desk twice because I could not figure out how to turn one light on and no one ever came  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice cool vanity but dont expect to take a bath because there was no tub  The prompt room service was the high point  They brought me a nice fruit plate with my continental breakfast for no extra charge I had not asked for it the juice was fresh squeezed and the coffee hot  
N => Dark yes but great location nice place After reading the reviews   our group almost cancelled our reservations  After arrival   we are glad we didnt  Yes okay the lobby is dark  So what All the hotels trying to be hip and trendy tend to be dark  Check in was fast and efficient  Hotel is centrally located  You can walk everywhere  My room was HUGE and well lit  Bathroom was large enough to accomplish what needed to be done Honestly I dont understand all the negative reviews  We booked as part of corporate travel   so we didnt pay total rack rate  And yes I agree there are other nicer hotels around that area  This one was still a four star  If you get it on Priceline or just get a good deal   you have scored a win  I would stay there again  
N => Darkest Hotel Ive stayed in I have read the reviews listed below on tripadvisor and I think they do a great job reviewing this hotel  I just wanted to add a quick note to anyone who might be bothered by the two problems we had with the Hard Rock hope this helps you when picking a place to stay in chicago I usually get a little depressed if Im surrounded in darkness  This is just a problem for me so it might not have the same effect on other guests  The lobby is almost completely black the hallways and doors are dark grey and the rooms were the most uncomfortable grey I ever seen  It didnt help that the four days we were in Chicago were cold dark and raining  The other problem we had was when we ordered a roll a way  The fee was    It is a airbed that inflates  Once inflated however it did not fit anywhere in the room  We tried everything we could think of but it would have to be folded over in order to fit  Didnt seem safe at all to me Im sure that it cant meet safety codes  Our son slept in our bed  When I asked the staff that I didnt want to be charged   because the bed could not fit in the room they looked at me like I was crazy  Surely this must be a problem everytime someone orders the airbed Or be the dark hotel was having an effect on me  Im usually fairly easy going but I think there might be better hotels for your stay in Chicago  
N => Perfect Stay We booked  rooms for  nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend  We arrived at the Hard Rock at around  a m  and they were able to give us our rooms early  Hooray We were on the th floor Beatles theme  The rooms were very comfortable  One of our rooms was on a corner and had lots of windows  The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows  Not a great view from our side of the hotel but we didnt pay for a room with a view  The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable the bathroom was full of Aveda products and there was a bathrobe in the closet  The tvdvdstereo combo was nice but we werent in the room a lot to use it  We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacksdrinks as they were weighted and wed be charged  No problems there  We did not make use of the free fitness center because the weather was perfect  My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead  He said it was wonderful We did use the free internet in our rooms  It was wired internet but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway The room was a bit dim at night but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps  There was virtually no hall  elevator noise  The location of the Hard Rock is ideal  It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery just blocks to either Grant Park The Art Institute State Street Shopping or Michigan Ave  To sum up there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about  We would be glad to stay here again any time  
N => Will not stay here again We stayed here as part of a wedding group and it was great to be in close proximity of those folks  Otherwise after spending one night here I can find no good reason to step foot inside the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago again My wife and I regularly spend long weekends in Chicago and had been staying at the House of Blues because we loved the vibe and funky or  Sadly the HOB has long been tired out and we havent stayed there for two years instead bunking at the Sofitel W Lake Shore Hotel Indigo and Hotel Monaco looking for a new quothome away from home quotWe had looked forward to trying the Hard Rock as a new hip place to stay but were disappointed at every turn  Our room was beat up and dirty the staff members pretentious and rude when we called to register our complaint and ask for another room and the bar was lhably small when we tried to drown our sorrows  Oh there was one good thing   the elevators were fast  Which was nice because we couldnt wait to leave 
N => Nice Stay at the Hard Rock My husband amp I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago over Easter Weekend  We had a basic King room that overlooked Michigan Ave  Overall the hotel room was very nice  It was a good size and the bed was comfortable  Only complaint was the lack of lighting in the room but that of course didnt ruin our stay It is located further down on the Magnificant Mile but close to the Theater District  We ate breakfast at the China Grill on two mornings  The buffet was only so so   there is a good breakfast place around the corner from the Hard Rock called Old Timers that we discovered on our last day  Good food and reasonably priced The conceriege desk was very helpful amp accomodating and they have several pamphlets on shopping amp dining for you to have During our stay we went to the Lincoln Park Zoo in our opinion an absolute MUST saw Wicked at the Oriental Theater went to US Cellular Field to see the White Sox and shopped A LOT We had a great trip to Chicago amp we would definitely go back but probably would want to try out the numerous other hotels located in the Loop just to try something different 
N => Picky reviewer I tend to be really picky when it comes to hotels and I always check for reviews    Hard Rock Hotel is close to Millenium Park but a distance from all the main shopping area  The hotel is very clean and modern to say the least  The room itself was very sleek and we were so happy with our ision to stay there  In the evening we went to the bar downstairs wehere they had a DJ and it got pretty crowded   Drinks were a bit expensive but its the price to pay where youre at  pretty much everywhere around there you will pay the same prices  I have no real complaints 
N => Perfectly Adequate Yes the beds are great  Plus the room on nd floor was silent throughout the night  Room service prices reasonable  Service very good  The negatives tiny amount of drawer and closet space  Only one small drawer per person a very small shared closet  Not enough hangers  No bathtub in room only shower I like options  Only one bathrobe provided  Lighting was dim throughout including bathroom though it was flattering if that helps  The reading lights by bed were adequate though    a big plus since so many hotels fail in that regard  The walls in the bathroom were dirty looking and the bathroom countertop was trashed    it looked dirty but was just badly stained  Poor choice of cheap countertop material  But adequate space for amenities  Overall a perfectly fine place just not exceptional  But the good nights sleep made the negatives less odious  
N => Form over function   average hotel We stayed at the Hard Rock  to   Admittedly wed rather be on the other side of the river but due to the limited hotel rooms available when we made our reservations we ided to try the Hard Rock Our  PM check in went smoothly although it is a bit odd to have to navigate the patrons in the dark lobby turned lounge for the evening hours  Our room was on the th floor with a ent view down South Michigan Ave  Typical of a revamped metropolitan building the rooms are a bit smaller than the typical hotel room but certainly not cramped or uncomfortable  The or is a stark cold modern kind of look which is aesthetically pleasing to tastes such as mine but really didnt end up being very practical The bathroom fixtures are all made of chrome open rung type surfaces which ended up being a nuisance as everything from the soap in the soap dish to the towels under the sink continually fell through the bars  The desk amp chair are likewise very contemporary and great looking but not very ergonomically designed or geared for real use  My husband owns his own business and must stay in touchdo some work while traveling and found the setup very uncomfortable after a  hour or so  The internet service was awful at first but after a call to the service company they did get it straightened out by our second day  The bed was quite comfortable and the linens on the bed amp in the bathroom were some of the nicest weve had  Housekeeping was good although they failed to replenish hygiene items during our stay The sound buffering in the hotel is abysmal  Although old buildings are unavoidably noisy due to their construction its even worse in this building due to the complete lack of buffering  You can actually see daylight for a  inch around the top amp sides of the rooms door and there is almost two inches of space below  This serves as a megaphone for the already echoing sounds of every person stomping down the hall and every door slamming some guests such as us seemed to catch on to this amp were exceptionally careful about generating noise but others were oblivious which created disturbances day and night Having a late afternoon flight we requested a late checkout which was cheerfully granted  The automatic checkout wasnt working on the day of our departure but a quick phone call to the desk was all that was required Overall this is a nice hotel but we probably wouldnt be back unless there were no other options  Its the opposite side of the river from most everything we like to do while in Chicago and the noise levels made for a less than restful weekend  However if you are a deep sleeper prefer staying in the Loop and like a funky contemporary environment I would recommend the Hard Rock  
N => Worst Hotel Service Ever I stayed here for a weekend and couldnt believe how terrible the staff was  I had called earlier in the day before check in to see if I could change my reservation from a king to a double bed  The front desk person Tim happily confirmed my change  Upon arrival not only did they say I hadnt called but they claimed that a Tim doesnt even work there They went on to explain that my quotupgradequot would cost me an EXTRA    After  minutes of the staff denying that a Tim works for them I finally got a manager on the phone to discuss the situation  She then finally admitted that a Tim does work for them but get this THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM because he is new I could not believe that they deny his existence and then tell me they arent responsible  I felt like I was back in ior high  To have the MANAGER of a hotel as prestigous as the Hard Rock treat a customer like this is unbelievable  I will never stay at a Hard Rock again  
N => Was this really the Hard Rock Hotel My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad  Weve stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there  Its not that way here These  be all ticky tacky things but they added up to us First of all the room  We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with quotan Incredible viewquot  Well our th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us  That was all we could see  So there was no view  The room was muggy  We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below   We woke up sweaty both days  When we opened the window to get a breeze the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing The room was small and dark but it didnt bother us that much  The bed  have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in  And we even joked about stealing the pillows We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster but they removed the charges no prob Throughout the entire hotel I counted a total of  pieces of music memorabilia  I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to reate an old hotel throw a Styx guitar on the wall and slap a HRH emblem on the outside The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a reation  The location is good right on the south end of the mag mile but there are   better hotels in a better location to shopping quality eats and Navy Pier If you have a car parking will cost you day which is prob normal for downtown The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant  The bar was small and trendy and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didnt have a blender  WHAAT A HRH without a blender Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town Mind blowingI would never never never go back here  Like I said there are many better hotels in much better locations  I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again  
N => thanks for a great weekend hard rock just spent a wonderful weekend at the hard rock hotel on  to   my boyfriend treated me on a birthday getaway to chicago amp we ided to stay at the hard rock for the special occassion  what an awesome hotel the hotel is hip trendy and just simply COOL as soon as we steped into the lobby we knew that we made the right choice by picking the hard rock  we arrived early around am amp we were able to check into our room  we were so excited we were able to drop off our luggage amp not have to worry about coming back at pm to check in  we stayed in a hard rock room   a spacious corner room  it was completely sexy looking with modern furnishings and was extremely clean  we had a view of the chicago river on one side amp lake michigan on the other side the views were simply breathtaking even from the bathroom i did not feel that the room was dark at all as noted in previous post we had plenty of light  the bed was so comfortable it made it quite difficult to get out of bed in the morning  i could just go on amp on about the room but ill let you see more in the pictures that i posted  while walking around the hotel we were stopped by the quotvibe managerquot amp he asked if we had a few minutes to take a quick survey of the hotel  upon finishing the survey he gave us  free drink coupons to use at the bar        what a nice treat considering the prices of drinks at the bar  we had dinner one night the the hotels restaurant china grill  great food amp great atmosphere and the service was top notch  they asked if we were celebrating anything special amp we mentioned that it was my b day  when they brought out our dessert they put sparkly candles in it what a nice surprise they really made us feel like rock stars i highly recommend the hard rock hotel amp we would definitely stay here again  thanks hard rock for making my birthday weekend something i will never forget 
N => Better places to stay I reserved this hotel  months ago and got a confirmation for a DOUBLE room  Since I was traveling with my brother we definitely wanted  beds  We arrived early before check in and was told that there were no clean DOUBLE rooms available  We said no problem checked our bags and went site seeing  We arrived back at around  and our room was ready  We opened the door and saw a room with one king bed  After walking around all day and getting very hottiredexhausted we had looked forward to showering and relaxing with some cold beverages  But we had to lug our suitcases back to the reservation desk and tell them they made a mistake with our room  The reservationist dont remember her name was very hard to understand and informed us that quother systemquot showed a reservation for a KING bed  I showed her the confirmation indicating a DOUBLE room and said that there were none available  But there were at an upgraded price  I said that if there were some available that they will be complimentory  She said she couldnt do it  I asked to see the manager and she said hes in a meeting  I asked to see ANY manager and she said they were all in the same meeting but if I wanted to go back to the room shed let me know when they were done  I said Id wait  I waited probably a half an hour and she still said they were in a meeting  I walked to the concierge and explained our situation and she couldnt believe that the reservationist wasnt doing more  SHe said shed get the manager out of the meeting and left  SHe came back  minutes later with the manager  Guess what It was the same guy that told us there were no quotDOUBLE ROOMSquot clean  He must have been the one to type into the system a King bed  I told him I cant wait to write this up on Tripadvisor and he proceeded to hand me his business card and said quotremember to tell the whole storyquot meaing he took care of the problem  This guy was acting like he was some kind of hero when he messed up to begin with  No apology no nothing  THe room was just as small as the first one so I dont know why this would have cost more  The view was worse  I think the person checking you in should have the authority to make the situation right  I wasnt looking for any freebies  I just wanted the room that I reserved  The maid service was pretty bad too  We had drank some beers and placed all of the emptys into the case that the beers came in  PLaced the case right next to the trash can  Basically cleaned the room up before leaving for the day  also left a nice tip  When we returned later that day the case with the empties was never removed  They didnt replenish the shampoossoapsconditioners Then theres the mini bar  We had leftovers from lunch so we moved things around in the mini bar so we could put the container of leftovers in there  When I got the bill there was a  charge for the mini bar I guess if you move things it electronically charges you  the small print on the mini bar states that but youd have to get on the floor to notice it  I had to tell them about it at check out and she stated that quotwe tell our guests about it at check inquot  That was never comminicated to us  They took it off the bill without a problem  Other guests had the same problem  They should disable this quotmodern technologyquot The place was too dark  I like ambiance but I also like to see what Im doing  On the positive side the beds were comforatable and the pillows were great  The air didnt seem to cool very well though Ive stayed in Chicagos magnificent mile  times and never had a problem with any of the chain hotels  I will choose one of those next year and will never stay at the Hard rock hotel again NOTE TO MANAGER did you ever hear the phrase quotthe customers always rightquot  You could have done some gesture to show some good will instead of acting like you did me a favor by fixing YOUR screw up  
N => Not impressed We stayed here during NeoCon e   and had  rooms for our group  The AC sucked to put it bluntly  My room said it was  but it was probably  and I had it set on  the entire trip  I asked to have it checked and there was no improvement  I got NO additional toiletries in  nights  The final morning I had to call down for shampoo because while I travel with my own conditioner I had more than used up the ONE bottle I was given I left a note asking the maid to leave the iron out it was put up each day to replace a lightbulb never done and to leave the shampoo  be she didnt read English but given the notes were left in  locations you would have thought she could have asked someone The lobbybar was freezing which just served to make me more angry regarding the room temperature  The workout facility seemed nice quite dark but one didnt work one other didnt have a good headphone set up you had to hold in the plug to get sound and the rd was the only real option if you wanted both headphones and a working treadmill  It was as if maintenance didnt exist at the hotel in my opinion I will say the bed was very comfortable and I liked the or  The service was a turn off tho  
N => Hard Rock hard to beat We stayed at the HRHC e     We had a Tower Room on the st floor  The view was UNBELIEVABLE Great architecture and the channel of water during the day awesome light show at night the buildings are lit and some even change colorThe room itself was awesome as well spacious modern and cool artwork We lucked out to have Paul Stanley KISS and David Bowe mirrored artwork in the room   of my husbands fave musicians My husband still compliments the king size bed and how COMFY it was We slept so well while there  THANK YOU HRH for a nice end to our vacationThe only odd thing in the room was the bathroom   well the configuration of the door  When the door was opened it met the vanity counter and youd then have to close it to get to the commode  Not a big problem but there was also a fluffy cotton rug on the floor and you had to move it out of the way to close the door and it was just an inconvenience  The shower stall was HUGEwhich was wonderful after traveling by Amtrak and dealing w the porta shower they have  adults have plenty of room and then some The bath towels were huge  bath sheets  and they offered a nice assortment of soap lotion etc  They even have fresh orchids in the bathroom and bedside and they light a candle in the bathroom for you in the evening at which time they also lay out a robe and slippers  meant only for room use but can be purchased to take home   I CANNOT believe the couple of bad reviews I read on TA The staff is SO ACCOMMODATING haled us cabs quickly wiped up a spilled drink while in the front bar area and even held our luggage after check out so we could enjoy one last romp thru town before heading to the airport  We definitely recommend this hotel  ENJOY your time as a Rock Star 
N => A few things to consider before staying here I just returned from a  night stay at the Hard Rock  Check in was easy but the parking was a little confusing  The Valet parking is in the side on South Water but the directions take you to Michigan Ave  We finally figured it out after circling around the block which is not easy to do in Chicago  The rate is   per day  WOW but I parked my car for the duration and walked  The location is great but it was the street noise was unbeliveable and we were on the th floor  Especially on Monday when the offices opened up We were rattled out of our beds at  a m  by the incredible sounds of traffic  We just couldnt believe it  The previous reviews we read about how dark the hotel was are absolutely true  We couldnt even find enough light to put on make up The first room we were in was the basic deluxe room  It was so small and dark I asked for an upgrade and moved to a Hard Rock room for an extra  per night  Well worth the cost as the rooms are in the corners so we had tons of windows and natural light  We ate at the China Grill on Friday night and it was Fabulous  I would highly recommend this restaurant  The only complaint was the noise again  We had four girls and we had to practically yell acrossed the table to talk  Not a place for a romantic dinner  Our bill was  for  people with no drinks  The staff at the Hard Rock was great  Always willing to help out  I will stay here again in the future 
N => going downhill raplidy we first stayed in the hard rock ch  and was very impressed  we really enjoyed our stay  when we ided to go back to chicago with our friends this year we booked the hard rock hotel again  this time was a different story  the room really needed a lick of paint and hardly any water came out of the shower  on our second day we discovered there was ants everywhere in the room  we asked to be moved and we were no apology given or no upgrade for the inconvenience  our second room  the shower did not work and again was in bad need of a piant  room service is very slow ordered breakfast and was waiting  minutes for it to be delivered  will definately go to chicago again but will not stay in the hard rock 
N => Great Room I stayed ther a couple of weeks ago amp had a quotHard Rockquot room  Very nice room good size great bed great electronics cddvd player flat screen tv  Kind of pricey but I really liked the room  Staff was great  Bar scene was cool  Room service breakfast was outrageously priced for average food find any other place in the city Overall a very nice hotel  
N => Worst hotel ever Dont Valet Park They will rob you This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at They had horrible service from the time we got there to the time we left  We stayed New Years Eve and New Years Day and were robbed by the valet service before we left The shower sounded like the pipes were going to explode and had no hot water  We asked about leaving my truck in valet until after we got back from the Bears game on   nd and the girl at the front desk told us they would even get my truck so that we could put our luggage in it after we checked out and put it in a secure lot until we got back  When we got back they pulled the truck up with a hole in the passenger window and several thousand dollars worth of items missing Then they told me that someone was TOO LAZY to put the truck in a secure lot They knew the items were in the truck because they helped load it After that the hotel staff proceeded to tell us everything would be taken care of       They waited till we left and when I called them to get things straigtened out they blamed the Valet service and said they could not do anything about it Not only that the valet service refused to pay us for any of our items DO NOT STAY HERE DO NOT USE THE VALET SERVICE 
N => Welcome To Hell The room was really bad  The Bathroom had wallpaper with guys on it  I dont know about the rest of you but I dont want to have a picture of a guy in the same room when Im using the bathroom  The air vent made noise all night long  Room service took forever It was  bucks a day just to have the car in a parking garage that you cant go in if you forgot something in it  Above the bed and in the bathroom there was what my girlfriend thought where sprinklers  I understand sprinklers in the main room but Not in the Bathroom 
N => Cold You could not pay me to stay at this hotel again  The Hard Rock Hotel is not very warm or welcoming  After staying here I have come to hate the color Gray 
N => Cancelled before I got to the front door I cancelled my reservation because each time I got someone on the phone with additional questions I struggled to communicate with them  I was an obvious interruption and they were doing everything they could to get me off the phone  quothow can I rock your world todayquot became an IRRITATING cliche with nothing behind it but borderline rudeness  Go to the Comfort Inn on Ohio for  the price   excellent  When you stay in Chicago you are looking for a safe pleasant place to sleep  The rest of the time you will be anywhere but your motel room  
N => Stay at House of Blues Instead I would definately not recommend this hotel  We came down for a special occasion and so they told us they upgraded our room  It was still incredible small I could not tell what made it an upgrade  They told me I had two windows instead of one and  more sq  ft   I feel bad for people who pay good money for a standard room  All night long there was a pounding noise and when I went to the front desk to tell them we did not get any sleep and where not happy with our stay all they did was tell us to fill out a survey  They could care less if you are happy with your stay  The maid came to our door at am and wanted to know when we were checking out  How rude The bar is not at all happening like you would expect from a Rock and Roll Hotel  The only plus are the beds  They are very comfortable  We usually stay at the House of Blues and thought we would try some place different  What a mistake  The House of Blues blows this place away in every way 
N => Happy New Year    Guided By Voices We stayed at the Hard Rock    Had a great stay  Only problem was the room was small limited closet space and the shower leaked water on the bathroom floor and onto the carpeted room each time we showered  The China Grill bar amp restaurant was good  Conciere recommended pizza delivery was good  Location and bellstand service was outstanding  
N => Hard Rock Made grat impression We were in Chicago for the weekend with no reservations because we were sure if we were going to stay  We went to the Hard Rock and paid for  night  After the front desk took a long time because we didnt have a reservation before  We were on our way to our standard  bed room   minutes later a man came to our door telling us that we were being moved to a Hard Rock room because of the wait downstairs  This room was about  times bigger than the first room and we got it for  nights at the standard room rate  Very nice The lounge was very nice upscale and the music is always great at hard Rock  Parking was right across the street if people took the time to look and the staff was on top of things the whole time  Our room seemed a little warm when we checked in we called for someone to come look at it and someone was at our room within  minutes changing the air filter to make it more comdortable  We will definately stay at Hard Rock again when we come back to Chicago 
N => Dont waste your money We requested early check in regular check in is at pm got there at pm and had to wait an hour and a half to get a room  They wouldnt even notify us when our room was ready I had to stand in line every half hour and inquire about my room Room was pretty clean but the or is cheap and tacky  When checking in we were told the continental breakfast was free but the hot breakfast was not  I had eggs and coffee my wife had a bagel and coffee  We were charged  for hot breakfast and  for continental  I complained to manager at checkout and he said quotI find it hard to believe that you were told the continental breakfast was free quot I asked if he found it easier to believe that I was lying   he then said quotyou consumed the breakfast you have to pay for the breakfast quot To avoid a fight I just paid but will never stay there again  The Sheraton and the riott cost about the same but are much classier hotels  
N => eXCELLENT SURPRISE When a client conference was announced to be held at the Hard Rock I was dubious  I was very happily surprised from the moment of my arrival that service and facilities were excellent  Warm and professional the staff was outgoing and knowledgable  Quality training showed in everything from meeting management to room service and bar staff  I would definitely stay again and even seek it out  
N => Hidden Fees I thought everything was wonderful The staff was great they all knew my name  The room was great I recomend getting the Hard Rock room  The room service was way cheaper than I would expect to pay at a hotel like this  All was great until I got the bill in the morning and realized I had to pay for parking They had even told me it was included I guess they ment included in your final bill So I recomend finding parking on the street and risk getting a ticket  It will be cheaper than parking 
N => sleek or but need to work out the kinks  
N => Some things to keep in mind      
N => Good hotel  
N => Great room breakfast need to expand room service     
N => Great Room Miserable Service  
N => Hard Rock Rocked Our World  
N => Serves a purpose Stayed here for a few nights on a trip to Chicago to catch up with some friends who lived nearby  They did offer for me to stay with them but I didnt want to impose This is exactly what it looks like from the outside  A tired worn      motel thats it    what you see is very much what you get  I am not complaining   service was friendly and efficient buffet breakfast was basic but OK room was dated but clean enough bathroom tired but again no complaints at all about cleanliness  WiFi internet intermittent and crashes from time to time Bed was comfortable enough a little noisy from the traffic close to a busy intersection but with just the right amount of alcohol thats not a problem It does offer one thing again which is obvious from outside   low cost discreet privacy  If thats what you want this ticks all the boxes  Wonderfully trashy  There wasnt a  star box to tick for that in which case it would get full ks  
N => Poor Internet Service I contacted both AAA and the Manager of the Motel on this issue  I recommend that they do not advertise the Wireless Internet until they have their service together  I attended WorkShops during the day and planned to work back at my motel at night  The service frequently cut off Internet Access and I got messages that the Broadband Link was broken which I did page capture of the quotBroken Linkquot message  I tried to use the Internet early in the morning with the same result  On my last nights stay I contacted the front desk and the person on desk suggested that I pull my chair out of the room and sit under the router to get a stronger signal  I did this because I needed to work but of course this did not increase my access  They also suggested that I take my computer to the office  So I hauled my laptop down to the little lobby where they said I was only allowed to go and with the same result  no Internet Access  I was told that there  be Internet Cafes up the street  However I do not know Chicago well and I did not have a car because we carpooled  However I was willing to go and find a Cafe but I tried to call out on the hotel phone first to see what Internet Cafes might be open and available and only got a busy signal  My only option was to stay up all night and try to put in work whenever I might per chance get a connection  My hope is that management will take their offer of Free Wireless Internet down until they actually offer a solid service  If you are a business person who needs to have access to the Internet please reconsider your motelhotel options  
N => Reasonable value for Andersonville Rogers Park A reasonable cost option for a far northside hotel  Free parking free beakfast ent rooms not too noisy  Very convenient to Lake Shore Drive  Straight out Peterson to the Edens  
N => You must read this completly shocked dissapointed Terrible experiance  I had a guest visiting Chicago for the st time so I recommended the Hotel  The check in was no problem friendly older man checked us in room was nice amp clean  Gave his CC checked in for  nights amp was told a receipt would be given upon checkout  He stayed   the Hotel the st night  The following night we stayed out late so he stayed   my place  He never returned the following morning to return the key and he didnt get any phone calls from the Hotel so he assumed they would automaticaly charge him for an extra night  When he returned to the hotel that night he wanted to check in with the front desk before he headed up to the room  When he explained everything to the person   the front desk  The guy was extremly rude and kept cutting him off  Basically he told him that he was going to be charged for the  nights and  for a new key since he didnt hand it over   checkout time  When my friend said he was returning the key amp would like to check in again he was told in a terrible tone of voice that his room was already taken by another guest amp that there was no vacancy there for him that he had to go some where else  My friend said he was very upset but didnt want to start any trouble although it seemed that that is what the front desk clerk was trying to start up with him  So he asked if he could get his receipt   which the F Desk person a guy with a strong accent replied with even worst temper and physical movement by basically backing him out of the door telling him he wasnt going to speak to him anymore amp he wasnt getting anything from him if he wanted he could call the next day and put in a complaint and finally slammed the door in his face  I wanted to check on my friend to make sure everything went well at the Hotel so I called him an hour afterwards  He told me what had happened and I was truly horrified  He said he didnt want to tell me about it because he didnt want me to feel bad that he had had such a bad experiance happen to him here in Chicago while he was visiting for the first time  He didnt have anywhere to go so he figured he would drive around until the following morning  I immediatly called the Hotel  Now with out exagerating the phone must have rang more that  times before it was picked up but I wasnt going to hang up  I was very upset and couldnt believe what had happened  The guy didnt even say the name of the Hotel so I had to ask if this was the Hotel  So I said I had a couple of questions for him in a very pleasant voice  st I asked is there any vacancy    which he replied yes there are a quotFEW ROOMSquot available So I said okay well now I want to ask you another question    which he cut me off by saying quotwhy do you have another question I said there are rooms availablequot  I told him that I heard him the st time but it would be nice if he didnt cut me off because it was rude and I still wanted to ask him some other stuff  So I went on to tell him everything my friend told me happened and the whole time he kept cutting me off and tried rasing his voice but then I raised mine and said I wasnt my friend amp I wasnt going to let him treat me the way he treated him to which he started saying it was a mistake that he misundurstood that he never said there was no vacancy basically everything the opposite of what my firend had told me  He finally said to send him back that there was only one room available but he would hold it for  an hr until he got thereeven thought he had told me there were a few when I called but again he said I misunderstood when I brought it up   I called my friend insisted he come over and stay   my place but he felt bad about everything already so he preffered to go back to the Hotel  Once he arrived the guy apologized and tried to convince him that some how there had been a missunderstanding on my friends side  He even added that he had already spoken to the person that would be there in the morning for check out and that he had explained what had happened and that a discount would be offered to him as an apology  The best part yet came when my friend finally came to the checkout and the same guy was downstairs and basically said there is no discount call if you want to put a complaint and kicked him out all over again  I didnt find out about this until  days after he had left so I went to the Hotel and set a complaint to the person   the front desk who claimed they were an assistant manager  They heard everything with detail and they apologized and said they would leave a note with my name amp   so that the person that runs the place supervisorManager could call me back  They promised something would def  be done about it  They also told me while I was there that the room my friend was staying   didnt have a second lock so the guy shouldnt have checked the room out to someone else while my friend still had another key  They also said they wouldnt put the reason why my name amp number was being placed on the board for the SupervisorManager to see because if quotothersquot working there found out it was a complaint it might dissaper Are they serious Aparrently it has happened that someone has complained and yet the complaint filled has just dissapered  I got a phone call  days later from someone claiming they where calling to investigate a complaint  They said they were calling from the Hotel the voice sounded very familiar so I asked who was I speeking to   which they replied quotIm calling form Heart O Chicagoquot  I said I know but who am I speaking to what is your name The guy finally said it was him who I was complaining about and he wanted to know why I was doing it basically getting all defensive  I told him I wasnt going to speak to him that I was told someone specificaly would call me from management and I had nothing to explain to him so I hung up   weeks later nothing from no one      I guess my   and name misteriously dissapered from the Management board  I stopped in last night to ask about what was going on and the person   the front desk said he didnt know anything and didnt want to get involved he just gave me a card with the Hotels   on it  Aparently there is no way of contacting anyone else like managment thru email or phone  Just by leaving a stupid note on the board that will end up in the garbage before they ide to stop by to see if things are going well  I promise you though if they think this is over they are very wrong  
N => Noisy but clean Bad location  minute walk from nearest subway station  Paper thin walls  I could hear the people talking next door Rooms were clean  Much better to stay futher out in a hotel beside a subway  
N => Skanky skanky skanky This hotel was dirty and stinky  Not worth  a night  We ended up leaving and paying for somewhere else  
N => Beware I was supposed to stay here in e  but could not get to Chiacgo because of the summer floods  My transportation was cut off  I called Expedia to cancel my reservation who contacted the hotel  The hotel told them they would not refund us the money  We had to pay   of the room we never stayed in  I have never been to Chicago and was really looking forward to the trip  This was not up to me  If I could have I would have been there Where I come from when there is a natural disaster people come together and help each other out This kind of behavior is inexcusable I dont know how these people can sleep at night Not only did they take my money but they probably rented the room out out someone else So unless you can afford to throw away over  be careful about reserving a room here   you never know whats going to happen    FYI Expedia felt so bad about it they gave us a  credit  They were very good to deal with and I highly recommend them 
N => Chicago on a Budget Heres a GEM  My best friend amp I were going to visit Chicago for a long weekend  Wed hoped to stay closer to the Loop but the prices were light years out of our range  Heart O Chicago turned out to be absolutely perfect for us  I was worried about the distance from downtown since we didnt have a car but Andersonville is a fantastic little village in itself with plenty of restaurant cafe bakery amp bar options head south on Clark St barely  blocks from the motel  The red line El is about a   minute walk away so we used that to get to the Loop with no problem the bus system is also efficient  The motel was clean warm easy to find breakfast was a delightful surprise everyone was friendly amp helpful  I would guess that a single traveler could get from the bright lights of Clark St to their room safely after dark although I dont know Chicago well enough to say for sure    but the area didnt seem shifty to me  I should add that Im a quotroughing itquot sort of traveler amp dont need the amenities offered by a grand luxury hotel  If youre looking for a comfortable base this motel is a terrific deal  It was nice to get away from the cookie cutter monotony of the usual budget chain motel  And if you like retro Americana they have a superb neon sign 
N => Safe clean and cheap My boyfriend and I booked a last minute trip to Chicago after we found a great flight deal  We scrambled around trying to find a ent hotel deal for a prime weekend in the summer  Being budget travelers we were not willing to spend  a night on a hotel but were ready to give up until I contacted the Heart O Chicago Motel  We were able to book our  night weekend stay for  a night I thought it was too good to be true but it wasnt The motel is located just north of Andersonville in a safe quiet neighborhood  I wouldnt walk around at am alone here but if you use common sense you are fine  The motel rooms were very clean and we felt totally safe here our entire stay  It was so nice to come back to a comfortable room after a long day of sightseeing  The only suggestion I would offer to future customers is to pack your own towels  The towels provided are rough and small  The staff at the desk were very nice and helpful throughout our stay  Breakfast was even provided which was very nice The motel itself is close to the   bus line which will take you all the way into downtown it is a long ride though  It is about a  min walk to Andersonville which has lots of shops and restaurants  Overall I would definitely stay here again  Especially if I had a car parking is free  It is a bit of a long haul into downtown on public transportation but to save over  a night on a room was worth it to us  
N => Very good hotel for the price We just came back from a long weekend in Chicago spending  nights at this hotel  I chose this hotel from the reviews on this board  Well I was not disappointed at all  Actually it went beyond my expectation  When I called to book the room I asked for the one upstairs away from the street  I got room   I did not hear any street sound at night  What surprised me was that they changed my bed sheets and pillow cases everyday  There was no need for that for the price of  a night but I did not complain  The room was very clean no smell even though it is not a brand new hotel  We felt safe walking around at night  Clark Street is a very busy thoroughfare  We got  day pass and it was worth the  we paid for  We used it from Midway to the hotel and the whole weekend on all our transportation needs  
N => Good Price  get up with the times    get internet access at least dial up Nice and clean motel  But for business travelers your not up to current trends like something simple as Internet Access  Not even Dial Up Please get with the times  I have to go to a cafe to do work on the internet  
N => This hotel got madd elevators   This hotel has so many elevators you would have to switch elevators to go to a high floor  
N => Second Stay was Better This was my second time to stay at the Hilton Chicago and this experience was more pleasant than my first  Note My first experience was not unpleasant  This hotel is historical so dont expect a modernized Hilton  Do expect modern electronics however  My room was clean  The walls were as thin as the Hilton hotel walls tend to be but I didnt experience any streetcity noise  The convenient to McCormick Place but its a bit of a walk to the main tourist attractions  This is not a complaint though as its a quick cab ride to any of the main attractions  The hotel restaurants are nothing to write home about but they are ent  Expect the hotel to be very busy because it is large and can accommodate many people  Also dont be surprised to share the hotel with conference attendees who  be attending a conference in the Hilton or at McCormick Place  
N => Fantastic Location Hotel needs a reation We traveled to Chicago for ACS meeting this past weekend  We ided to bring our children along to explore the beautiful city of Chicago  This weekend was also the athon so the hotel was at capacity  Overall the location is absolutely perfect with kids  The hotel was understaffed and needs a major reation  We did stay in a quotsuitequot but all it had was some sort of a bar and a little more room  The view of the lake was amazing  The location made all of Chicagos attraction so convienient that it was worth it  My husband was upset that internet was not free for the  plus per night price tag    
N => Superb service Superb service began the moment I arrived  Check in was quick and painless  I won the room on priceline for   To my surprise I was awarded a room with not only two double beds but also two full bathrooms on the st floor A refrigerator was delivered very quickly at no charge  The bed was extremely comfortable and linens were supplied in abundance  My only complaint is that the thermostat in the room seemed to be broken and it was chilly  A call to the front desk resulted in  blankets being delivered in short order  A mainenance man seemed to fix the thermostat so that the number on the box seemed to match the temperature in the room  The fan still blew cool air however  The room temperature never did get above  degrees and would be acceptable to most  Turning off the fan and using the extra blanket seemed to do the trick  I noticed the bathrooms were comfortably warm  The location is convenient to Millenium Park Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain but a bit far from most nightlife  Overall I had a great experience 
N => Great Place to stay This is a great place to stay  we stayed at this hotel for  nights and it was really good  we enjoyed the place  
N => Palatial This was our first hotel in the US at the start of our Route  tour and had been pre booked in the UK  It was expensive it is far cheaper to book whilst in the States than from the UK  Parking was on site a multi storey affair but extremely expensive   about  for  hours  The overall feel of the hotel was good but it is huge and somewhat tired   you wouldnt call it cosy  Our room was big and we had two bathrooms first time ever which we thought was rather excessive but actually enjoyed having Not particulary great views from our room and we had one of the better ones  As the hotel dates from s  it had elegance and beauty but the hotel is very big and it does need a bit of updating  On saying that we really enjoyed staying there and it is in a good position to walk to the Sears Tower which is now the Willis Tower and to a lot of attractions  We didnt need to use our car whilst staying in Chicago  Staff were helpful  Didnt eat breakfast there   too expensive  If you turn to the left when exiting from main entrance you can find places to eat not too far away  Unfortunately on our first night we turned the other way and couldnt find anything and we were tired and hungryChicago was fantastic the skyline incredible  Worth going up the tower and having a trip on the river  lake We bought a sat nav to help us find our way around and we are glad that we did  It was as cheap to buy one as to hire one  It was the start of Route  and we did struggle to find the beginning and ended up just getting out of the city and picking up the route at Joliet Doh 
N => Great hotel in a great location My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for our first vacation away together  We stayed for a week  Check in was not till  so we ided to kill time by wandering through OHare and then taking the blue line to the Loop Jackson then walking to the hotel  We got lost our fault but if your compass works ours didnt it shouldnt be too far of a walk even with suitcases  The check in process was quick and the staff was friendly to us we are both  but we look closer to  so we were happy to be treated like adults  We ended up arriving a little early anyway around  and they let us have our room The room was small ish but there was enough room for two people and suitcases The one thing I did not like about the bathroom is the industrial type flusher on the toilet I prefer my hotel to have a homey feel so I did not like the public washroom style toilet the toilet worked fine though  The bathroom had enough counter space for both of us  The bathroom did not however have a fan so the mirror was always foggy after a shower  The shower was big enough and had a good waterflow  Also there was enough space on the edge of the tub and in the soap holders etc  for all of our shower stuff and if there wasnt the ledge of the counter is right outside the shower The only time we could hear the room next to us was in the bathroom so that was fine  However on the Friday we were there there was a lot of noise in the hallway and some drunk person was knocking on our door and trying to get in  Also the people in that room were smoking I believed it was a non smoking floor  We could smell it in the hallway but after a few days the smell crept into our room  The staff we dealt with for these issues was friendly and accommodating the lady at the front desk walked us over to the security kiosk about the noise complaint  We had hoped that the mini bar would have a fridge in it but it was just a cabinet with munchies we were not even offered the key but we could see in it  Also the bottled water in the room was  and the vitamin water was   Needless to say we drank tap water but there are Walgreens and CVS everywhere so you could go buy xmL bottles for probably   So whatever you do do not drink that water provided in the room The room service menu was ridiculously expensive and they add a   in room dining charge so if you wanted a sandwich it would cost you more than  We did not order but I do wonder what a  club sandwich tastes like The location was awesome  We attended Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park and the hotel was close enough that we could go back to use the bathroom and sit in somewhere air conditioned and get back in less than  mins and not have to use the porta potties  We timed our walk to the Hancock Centre and it was about  mins but its very easy to catch a bus or a train to the Magnificent Mile The concierge lady we talked to was useless  We asked a simple question when do we have to leave the hotel to be at OHare for  and she kept telling us to leave  hours before our flight which was at   We kept trying to explain that we had an international flight and had to BE there  hours early  Eventually she said it could take quot mins to an hourquot so we ided to catch our cab around  just to be safe  We ended up at the airport with about   hours to spare but OHare is big so we shopped and explored  The cab ride back cost us about  after tip and took about  hour  mins Overall I liked this hotel and I might stay here again if I can get a good deal  
N => Fantastic We arrived on Sunday night the th of  from SydneyAustralia where we live to go back home to EdinburghScotland to visit family and friends United lost our luggage between LA and Chicagobut said it would arrive on the next flightso we only had the clothes we where wearing Next morningstill no luggage had arrivedwent out for the day to tour your beautiful citycame back late afternoonstill no luggage My wife phoned Unitedthey said they had  of our suitcasesbut where waiting for the rd to arrive before they would send them to the hotel Well you can imagine what my wife said to themand insisted they at least deliver the  cases so we can change clothes etcshavertoothbrushes etc nd daystill no luggageby this timelate at nightmy wife is in tearswe had to go to Target to buy some underwear T shirts etcthis is where Peter the bell captian comes in He was under the impression that United had delivered our  suitcasesand when we informed him that we where still waitinghe couldnt believe it He was straight on the phone to United and informed them in no uncertain manner but polite to get our cases over to the hotel as soon as possibleand informed themquot Is this your company policy to hold guests to ransom with there suitcasesquotThis is how good Peter washe went and got us tooth pastetoothbrushesdeodarantshaving kit and  vouchers for breakfast the next morning Now that is what I call customer relationsnothing was to much trouble to himand quotHey Prestoquot our luggage was delivered a few hours later Thank you again Peter for a great job doneinfact I think my wife gave you a big kiss on the cheek the next day Could not fault this hotel in any waystaff where so polite friendly and helpfullalso Karen on concierge for helping out clothes wiselovely hotelit was like walking into a palace back home in the UK Will use this hotel again when we visit your beautiful city  which cant be quick enough we both fell in love with it and please please do not touch your lovely old buildingsSydney demolished most of theresother cities could learn a lot from Chicago I think Chicago has the most friendliestpolitehelpful people Ive ever came across and cleanest city Ive ever visitedwent to New York afterwards and I can assure you its got nothing on Chicagoyou leave it for dead Im voting for you to get the Olympics in William and Lilian Scott  
N => Very nice but a couple of issues This was my first trip to Chicago  I was there for the Pampered Chef National Conference  My companions and I stayed in the two bed two bath room which was spacious enough for the  of us  The only issue was the room was not completed cleaned out when we arrived  The fridge had the previous guests leftover pizza and other dinner items left inside  The fridge was also missing items which we also reported because we did not want to be charge  for a missing Snickers bar  We received a conference discount so for what we all paid it was worth staying  However I would never pay the full price for this room  It is just too expensive for me  We did not eat there but I do recommend Diner  or was it Eleven Diner which is a few blocks away  Bed pillows were too soft for me but the mattress was wonderful  We had a nice view overlooking the park and Lake Michigan  Ask for it it is worth the view 
N => Great location beautiful building okay rooms  I booked this hotel thru priceline at  dollars but that was not a bargain seeing that I paid  for overnite parking The service was nice clean rooms  Even though I arrived exactly at  all the king rooms were taken but was offered a executive room for  more no thank you  So I got a room with two double beds and two bathrooms that was nice  Crabtree amp Evelyn products in BOTH bathrooms plenty of towels  Our room was very quiet even with the taste going on outside and we were right by the elevators  Great restaurants within walking distance  
N => This hotel was fine  Theres nothing either bad or good to say about this hotel  It was fine  No poor customer service no great customer service  The or was dated but clean  The room was small but there was nothing missing  If I were to go back to Chicago I would probably choose another hotel but if I had to stay here I wouldnt complain either  Theres just nothing exceptional about it  There are a lot of additional charges internet had three tiers of service which just sounds like a scam lowest of which was day  To check my bags for two hours after checkout was   A lot of nickel and diming for a pretty expensive hotel room without a lot of features  Also the room was quite noisy  Even on the th floor with the blackout curtains pulled there was a lot of street noise throughout the day and night  
N => Wedding anniversary get away The stay was ok  A couple things I liked was the comfort of the beds and room service was good  Things that I didnt like    when we checked in they did not have our room type they wanted to give us two double beds on our wedding anniversary  We had to end up paying  MORE to get a room with a king bed  Also the next morning we came back to our room after breakfast and our door would not open  I guess the key thing ran out of batterys and they had to spend about  hour fixing it while we sat in the hallway  That was a big disappointment  Also parking is an extra  dollars so be ready for that  There is a lot around back the is about  a night but it is in a uncovered area and very small  I guess overall I just expected to have a better time at a  star hotel in downtown Chicago  be we just had bad luck 
N => dirty outdated Mold in shower corner  Plastic tiny tub which is hard to stand up in  springy with no flat bottom   Unravelling carpet  Slow Internet despite  service  Towels not replaced  No glasses  have to use styrofoam coffee cups if you want a drink of water  Shower bath soap holders grungy  have lost brass coating  Tiniest bathroom I have ever encountered  Outdated furniture and old carpet  despite paying for a suite  Good location but not great  far from Magnificent mile but close to Art Museum Milennium Park Grant Park Columbia Universtiy  
N => What happened to Chicago Hilton I recently stayed at this once stellar hotel  I mean this hotel was my favorite  Boy what happened Property and staff seemed beat up  big time  I woke up and there was no hot water the hotel wasnt even sold out  After a dozen rings to guest service line I was told it was because a lot of people were taking showers at the same time  Ok    I waited it out as I am adverse to cold showers  Lucky I wasnt on business  Parking is a whopper day  
N => Conrad and Paris Hilton should be ashamed  Its not a bad hotel  Its just so   disappointing  As a Diamond member I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view  Im not distrht over this but come on  Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge which has nothing but fattening pastries bagels and cereal  Low level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame  And whats with the lounge not opening until am Business travelers often need to be GONE by  not sitting down to their meager breakfast  The in room wifi is a pain to access and I somehow got stuck with the   plan even though I selected the basic plan  Dont get me started on how a night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full service Hilton amp Towers seemingly cant     Finally whats with the two bathrooms per one hotel room Its an unseemly waste of space especially when the rooms are so meager  And the gold plated bathroom fixtures scream  not  as does the picture tube TV vs  flat panel  Overall this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed  
N => Be Sure To Get Your Reservation In Writing This is a typical convention hotel   meaning average service and often indifferent employees   and I had to be there for  nights during a national convention  My real problem was caused by a disagreement over the price of the room  Even though I had an email from Hilton indicating the price   AND   even though I called to confirm it I was shocked to find that I was charged at a higher rate when I looked at the bill that was under the door my last morning  Even though presenting the copy of the email to the front desk manager I was told that the rate was not correct for the type of room I had  And I was told that they did not know the person I had spoken with on the phone to confirm the reservation  the managers suggestion   ask for a fax to be sent  Truly amazing    in this day and age when emails are honored I was told to get an actual fax from the Hilton reservations staff  As a Hilton Gold traveler I was disappointed in their unwillingness to honor the lower rate  But given the fact that they were full had a waiting list and are priily a convention hotel probably means that they can do what they want to do Service was quite average room service was average and the choice in their single yes only one  restaurant was the worst I have seen If you are planning to stay in the Loop or in downtown there are many manyother choices that are far superior to this Hilton  
N => fabulous hotel From the time we arrived to the time we left we felt as if we were being treated as royalty  Plan on a slow check in and paying mucho dollars for food but it was all worth it  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in  The staff made minor problems disappear  We were attending an event in the Grand Ballroom which couldnt have been run more smoothly and the wait staff was at our every beck and call  Plan on spending lots of  for the parking too but it is in the City of Chicago Breakfast the next morning was really slow but the food was good  
N => Great location We stayed here for the AORN conference  They had great shuttle service to the McCormick Center  The room was nice beds were small though  I think they were fulls not even queen  The room had two full bathrooms that was pretty neat  No view from the room you looked across to other rooms  There was so weird leak in the room above us could hear water dripping on the bathroom ceiling  We were afraid to call the hotel about it as we didnt want to be forced to change rooms we didnt think they even had any empty rooms  The snacks and beverages for the executive level guests were limited but better than nothing  I stayed here once years ago for the Chicago athon  Nothing much has changed  The lobby is still just as impressive with its piano player in the evenings creating a great vibe  The staff was still friendly  We had lunch at the restaurant across from the check in desk  Sandwiches were good about  for lunch for two  We were glad we didnt have to park a car here I saw on the web it was like  a night 
N => Not what I expected   in a bad way My single king room was tiny  The walls in the room were paper thin  You could hear full conversations and luggage rolling in the hallway and I dont just mean muffled noise I mean crystal clear speech as if no walls even existed I awoke several times during the night and morning due to this and I also woke up everytime someone in the adjacent room flushed their toilet  I do not consider my hearing to be great nor am I a very light sleeper and I have never had an experience like that at any other hotel  Also the old television in the room did not work and I am not a tech dummy  I booked at this hotel because it had a pool but the early closing pool was small and the hot tubs werent great either   the locker room was nice though The property is pretty nice on the outside and in the lobby but due to the sub par quality of the room I do not think that this hotel should be classified as a  star hotel  Overall I was very disappointed with my room and I do not think it was worth even the heavily discounted price I paid  
N => Watch Out for Cancellation Fees Echoing other reviews I have to emphasize Dont book at this hotel unless you are absolutely certain of your stay  I signed up under a draconian  day cancellation policy that left me aghast when I tried to cancel  room out of the  that I booked  Even though I was still staying at the hotel fewer people in my group were attending but the hotel was not sympathetic  They will charge you if they have the right  To me this says they care more about their bottom line than creating a good experience for their customers  
N => Not a Place for Business Travelers Internet access charges are extremely high business center is below average for a Hilton and watch out for early cancellation fees  I was traveling on business had to make a change as bussiness travelers do at times and was still charged my final night stay  because of a  day cancellation policy that was not well noted  
N => pleasant experience stayed in the towers rooms were ok except for the view there are also ones with great view but this was assigned to us be sure to ask for the one with the lake viewthe complimentary food amp drinks were impressivedownstairs in the lobby there was a chic bar where you wouldnt hesitate to invite your guests for drinks 
N => Great for Traveling with Teens We stayed one night while attending a fundraising event at the hotel  President Elect Obama was holding his first press conference here at the same time we were to check in   so I was expecting chaos   Instead the hotel was running quite efficiently in spite of the extra congestion   they appear to be well equipped for dealing with large crowds We stayed in an Executive Level room  This level has its own check in staff and a lounge  We did have to switch rooms initially since the first had a bathroom that smelled strongly of cigarette smoke  Our room had two bathrooms and two full beds with a nice view to the south  The two bathrooms were an excellent feature since we had  teens that needed to shower and primp  The location of this hotel provides convenient access to Grant Park and the museums  
N => Treated as VIPs I had a wonderful time during my stay at this Hilton  I stayed there with a friend and while I have heard that this hotel doesnt like non hotel guest to be walking around  I was never onced asked if I was staying at the hotel  We noticed there was a grand piano in the grand foyer area and we were curious if it was open to guests  We asked for a manager and sure enough he allowed my friend to play  Him being a musician and being rather talented on the piano drew a small crowd to listen to him play the piano and sing along  We were even asked to come back the next night to put on another quotconcertquot Which we did  We were unable to fufill a request for a third night due to our prior plans  The lady who was running the jewelry counter in the lobby area was extremely nice and was engaged in converstation for a good  minutes  We were welcomed by name after the first quotconcertquot The Irish pub was great  We ordered the appetizer platter and eventually had to cancel our orders because we were stuffed  We ordered some drinks at the bar and was a bit shocked to find  dollar tinis  but hey it is Chicago  Overall this was a very nice hotel  Loved the old world or  Never felt snobbish  Will stay again 
N => Nice hotel but not a good deal and really poor service I have stayed at other Hilton properties before and never had any problems but this particular hotel did not pass muster The hotel itself is quite lovely with a grand entrance and nice lobby But   From the moment I arrived there were problems  I waited for  minutes just to check in  For whatever reason it seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to process each person When it was finally my turn I was informed that only smoking rooms were available despite my having secured a reservation months in advance  I eventually was able to get a king room instead of two doubles but it was on a foul smelling smoking floor and basically I had a Murphy bed in the large living area of a suite  While the room was large and the bed comfortable it was not what I had wanted  Because this was obviously a larger room subdivided into three smaller rooms my door was problematic and often would not close properly  In fact on several occasions I returned to find that the housekeeping staff had not closed it properly The hotel did provide me with coupons for breakfasts to make up for the inconvenience but this really only softened the blow of the many other outrageous expenses including the most expensive in room internet I have ever seen  per bag per day luggage storage after checkout and on and on I have stayed in many high end hotels and am used to exorbitant prices but this was a situation of less for more right from the get go  
N => Good location HUGE hotel We stayed here since we are Hilton diamond members and we could bring our dog  we wont stay here again  The room was small and the hotel lobby was so crowded it was hard to walk around  The location was good but it would have been better to be closer to Wacker   it was quite a walk since we were at the south end of Grant Park  We felt like we were the only people there that werent part of a large convention   definitely the focus of this hotel  
N => please do not stay here I had the misfortune to stay at the hilton chicago The reason i chose the hilton was because i was running the athon amp it was the nearest hotel to the finish line offered to me by the organisers A week before departure i rang the hotel to order a transfer from ohare airporti even checked the day before departure  On arrival at the airport from the long flight from london guess what no transfer awaiting   i called the hotel amp an hour later a driver turned up A taxi would have been better but there were  in our party On arrival at the hotel the entrance facade is beautiful    that is where things end Check in was labourious amp unfriendly The one saving grace i thought was all the rooms were together The rooms were like living on the dark side of the moon    no daylight at all    amp for  a night our room was smelly as well The restaurants well if you could call them that    no  another irish bar with food  No  the courtyard rest with a very average menu amp barely edible food Surly service rather than friendly  To cap things off on the day of departure at lunchtime   guess what      After a mornings shopping we fancied a drink    all the hotel bars were closed   Pathetic All in all do not stay hear unless you are the US President they say they all have stayed thereIt certainlly shows because a refurb since abrahan lincoln would not go amiss  
N => Amazed by the Extreme Averageness I recently had a one night stay at the Hilton Chicago and it was possibly the most average hotel experience I have ever had  Not too good not too bad   just very bland The desk clerk was professional and friendly but just friendly enough to do his job   very stand offish  So it begins nothing really negative but nothing positive My room was smaller than expected but the bathroom was very nice  Very average The food at Kitty OSheas was very average and the service was just friendly enough but not at all engaging  I wouldnt recommend the bar to anyone but I wouldnt discourage anyone either Overall I have no real complaints about the place but no rave reviews either  So if you want an extraordinarily average hotel experience at an average price this is the place for you  
N => Not Worth the Money   Terrible Customer Service I stayed at the Chicago Hilton for a training in ust   I was not impressed with this Hilton at all and the staff acted as though all of their customers were a burden My trip was not off to a great start when I called from the airport to let them know that I would need late check in as in pm and was informed by the snooty Hilton rep that she would put in that request  Fortunately when I arrived they had a room available  I found out the next day that several of my colleagues reservations were cancelled and they were told to find lodging elsewhere When I got to my room the quotdead boltquot on my door did not work  I called the lobby and told them about it  The woman asked me in a very frustrated tone what a dead bolt was and once I referred to it as a privacy lock she said she would send up an engineer and hung up on me without saying anything further  This was eventually resolved Although I requested a King bed I was given a room with  double beds and  bathrooms  I found out that this was common in the hotel  The bathrooms were very clean  However the rug in my room was very worn out and at times my feet stuck to the carpet  The beds were soft and felt worn out  They squeaked every time you moved  The pillows were comfortable and the linens seemed clean  The AC was very old fashioned and did not work  My room was probably  degrees at its coolest  There were several amenities in the room but most were available at an additional cost   bottle of Evian   for  hour of wireless internt a mini bar where you could buy  candy or  beer  You are even charged for  numbers  When I woke up the next morning to iron my clothes I discovered that the ironing board had blood all over it and the iron did not work  I managed to iron my clothes without any blood transfer but I called to ask for a replacement ironing board and iron keep in mind I just asked for it to be delivered at some point that day  Again I was greeted by an annoyed Hilton rep who sighed and said he would see what he could do  Fortunately it was replaced  A colleague of mine told me that she discovered a large roach in her bathrub when she first checked in Even though I was able to secure a group rate I felt that this hotel was not worth the money  Although it is historical and orated purposely in an old fashioned style the hotel still comes across as worn out  The rugs need replacement and they need to make it a little brigther  Perhaps I would have had a more positive outlook if they actually believed in customer service  This probably wouldnt be a bad hotel for one night but I stayed for  and I couldnt wait to check out  
N => enjoyable stay Very nice hotel   lovely entrance and reception   only slight drawback is the location    well down South Michigan ave from most points of interest for visitors to the city who chose to walk   There are some bars and restaurants in the nearby quot loop quot district but it is mostly commercial  Kitty OSheas bar  restaurant on site was good value serving a fair selection of meals  Our room had two bathrooms which was unusual but turned out to be quite convenient   I would say the room was starting to show its age although there was no complaint about cleanliness or comfort  Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Chicagoand would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Practice Overbooking No Customer Service Had confirmed reservations  rooms  nights and  room  nights all King standard rooms  Arrived Wed evening to find out we had no rooms and none were available  After  hours of patient waiting Mgmt found  double room which we took and cramed  people into with the assurance our rsvd rms would be available between   next day  Next day same song made us give up our rm from night b by  but no rooms available while we waited  hours  Attended Bears game and got call at pm that rms were ready  After game should have had  rmsrest of our party arrived in town before game but couldnt get a room either mgmt only had  available both smoking doubles not king and they couldnt find booking for rd room  hours later found a quotpowder roomquot no real beds just sofa beds for our rd room  family travel with parents and in laws both sets of parents older than  yrs of age  Mgmt only reply was sorry we messed up  Many pilots and flight attendents in line while all this was going on each night and they apparently got rooms must have been Hilton Honors folks  We spent many hours about  hours total in lobby waiting to rcv the rooms we had been promised but was never provided anything related to service or truthful information  My son was staying in hotel so we really didnt want to go elsewhere due to conveinence factor  Total lack of communication by all members of onsite mgmt at any time  My entire party was completely civil the first night but I did lose it when the same scenario repeated the next night  No REAL help from anyone related to Hilton just the same fake quotsorryquot with the blank look at the computer screen  Hilton mgmt actually admitted that this happens all the time due to their standard practice of overbooking  Hilton rotates their mgmt staff so you will never meet the same mgr during your stay  Rooms were so so nothing special the best thing about the hotel was Kitty Olearys barresturant onsite  Total worthless customer service Ive been traveling nationally for  years and never have I been treated as badly as this hotel ever Avoid this place there are many hotels available in the same area at same rate which I guarantee treat their guests like human beings and have equivilent accomodations  We did not ever rcv a King Room and every room we did receive was a smoking room  No monatary reimbursement at all which I will be fighting by other means  
N => Just So So This hotel was somewhat difficult to rate  The rooms were elegant but the carpet and bedspreads seem a bit outdated  The room was clean  The matresses seemed a bit soft and worn  Pillows were very firm and felt new  Our room was rather dark   only two lights  Older TV  The bathrooms were attractive and well maintained  Check in was easy  We had to pay  for parking as we were told the only parking available was valet  What are the other options The staff was friendly and respectful  Be prepared to be quotpanhandledquot if you walk up Michigan Avenue from this hotel  This seems to be a growing problem in Chicago  We were confronted   times in a two hour period  I would think this would discourage repeat shoppers  We probably wouldnt stay here again because of the location  
N => Large and alright     My aunt planned a trip for us to Chicago for the night and with prices being as high as they are she booked are stay through priceline  We arrived at the hotel at about  in the evening and waited in a line that was nearly a mile long  After what seemed like an erternity we were finally able to get to the counter and check in    oh but not so fast    we were told that there were a lot of late check outs so the room was not ready  We ided to go have a drink in the bar  for ONE vodka and cranberry and then have dinner right there in the hotel  We were going to see the show quotJersey Boysquot at  so we didnt have a lot of time to spare  Finally about  we were able to get our room after waiting in line again and the room was very nice  We had a nice view the room was clean and the bathroom was nice  The one thing they need to add are fans in the bathroomThere was a lot going on at this hotel that evening    there was a Chicago Bears pre season game that night Believe it was the first of the season and there was a Harry Potter convention going on as well so needless to say there were a TON of people  The hotel is plesant but just needs to work on making sure to take care of all their guests  Its in a good location and within walking distance to a TON of things  When I go back to Chicago I would look into staying at this hotel again  Hopefully the lines wont be as bad as the last time 
N => Mediocre at best Normally we would have chosen a different property after reading all of the mixed reviews we were here for a convention that was being held at this hotel so we really HAD to stay here    Now for the reviewFor a Hotel with such a grand history things have really gone down to the level of horribly average  ArrivalUpon arrival from the airport in a taxi our cab driver was of more assistance with our luggage than the bell staff was  The bell staff was very young inexperienced and seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than opening the cab door welcoming us assisting us with our luggage tagging it to be delivered to our room after check in etc  It seems that the work of a bell person was a chore they were not paid to do Check InEfficient with no problems what so ever  Given the room type that was reserved  Total time at check in less than  minutes RoomLugged our own luggage to the room  Bell staff ignored us as we walked past them with our bags  The room was clean seemed a bit dated but well maintained until we needed the air conditioning which did not blow cold air  Called over  times requesting maintenance  No one came so we left for dinner  Arrived back at the room at AM and the air is still broken  Also needed  toiletry kits as the airline had lost our one bag that contained liquids  Took almost an hour and over  phone calls to a very annoyed person at the front desk to get these kits and take the report of the broken air conditioner again  When the person arrived with the toiletry kits turns out Housekeeping only sent  travel sized sticks of deodorant  Hard to brush your teeth with that  Made a sixth call to tell them that we needed the rest of the kit  The annoyed front desk person said she would correct housekeeping and have them sent back  Also informed that she had no idea when or if the air would be fixed  Asked to be switched to a different room and we were told the hotel was completely sold out  Asked to speak to the manager  He was able to move us to another room on the quotExecutivequot floor  In addition he delivered the toiletry kit himself  By this point it is almost AM  He comped the st night  An acceptable end to a terrible beginning The rooms were probably last updated in the s based upon the style of furniture the bathroom tile brass fixtures and quotgoldquot trim on the furniture  Everything is in working order in the room  Carpet is probably newish  Beds are comfortable but sheets have numerous holes in them  The Executive Level rooms are NO DIFFERENT than the other floors  Also the television is located on a large stand right in front of a window  It makes it VERY difficult to open or close the curtains  This was the case in both rooms we were in and can be seen in the submitted photo  It can also be noted that if you need to use the vanity mirror in the bathroom it is located VERY HIGH up on the wall and can not be moved  If your tall your ok otherwise it is useless  See photo The hotel is Grand in its public areas some might like it others might call it gaudy and very very average everywhere else  The service has A LOT to be desired  Based upon the service this should be a  Star Hotel not a  Star as advertised  Weve stayed in Courtyard by riotts with superior service and ammenities  RestaurantsWe had lunch at the on site Irish Pub quotKitty OSheasquot  The service was ok  The servers friendliness made up for her lack of speed  Overall the food was below average and pricy but the french fries that come with the hamburger were good as was the Onion Soup  All in all I wouldnt eat here on the property again with the exception of be room service Mini Bar Prices Although I expect the items to be more expensive than lets say a   these are VERY HIGHDomestic Beer    Imported Beer    Robert Mondavi Wines         glassAbsolut Vodka     minisBelvedere Vodka     minisBombay Sapphire Gin     minisJim Beam Black Bourbon     minisDewers White Label Scotch     minisOrange Juice      glassCoca Cola      can not a whole canDiet CokeSpriteTonic Water     whole canEvian Bottled Water      oz   Half BottleRed Bull Energy Drink     Smaller CanRice Krispy Treats    Snickers    Peanut MampMs    Reeses Peanut Butter Cups    Pringles      sized can   never saw this size beforeGardetto Snack Mix    Planters Peanuts     Small BagWheat Thins     VERY small bagAll of the above prices DO NOT include sales tax or   GratuityService Charge  
N => Pretty good overall On my two recent stays here my room was quiet clean comfortable and spacious or so it seemed to me though I was traveling alone   The rooms look sort of dated like they could use refurbishing but that didnt bother me   Hotel staff were nice and cooperative  Not sure about the food  On my first stay the salmon I ordered was pretty good  When I ordered what I thought was the same dish on my second stay I found it overseasoned and too heavy like so much American restaurant fare these days  No I havent developed an ulcer since my first stay  The breakfast buffet was reasonably good  Overall this is a good hotel but nothing special  I would quite willingly return though I will also check out other options when I next need a hotel in downtown Chicago  
N => Great Hotel But    My wife suprised me with a visit to Chicago for my Birthday to watch some baseball  We saved about  off our room with useing pricelines name your own price  The hotel itself was great The bed was cozy room was clean lobby was nice pool area and sun k was also very nice  I just find it odd that they charge you EXTRA to use the work out facility aside from the pool which was free  Also trying to get ahold of someone to bring up a couple of extra cups to the room took about  min All in all the hotel itself was nice but service was below average and charging to use the workout room Come on    If you are out of town and visiting Chicago make sure to try Garretts Popcorn there are multiple stores downtown  Yummm     
N => Swissotel is better We stayed one night in e before Taste of Chicago as a relaxing retreat to the city  Being from the suburbs of Chicago and having extensive travel experience I felt the Hilton was a safe bet and reasonably priced for our one night stay  I was impressed by the location but disappointed by the hotel itself  This particular location seems to be more like a glorified convention hall  There are few places to sit and relax in the public portion of the hotel because there are event areas and barsrestaurants taking up most of the downstairs space  The registration area is claustrophobic and inefficient  Our room was not ready for check in at pm and we were promised that we would be called in  minutes   trips to the desk after waiting in line again and again and  hour  minutes later we were given keys to our quotupgraded for your troublequot room  There was a room service platter sitting outside our room when we got there and it was still sitting there when we left the next day  There was only a stand up shower and there was no place to put shampoo except the floor  We received a bill under the door for  that referenced food we didnt eat  When I called to inquire about the charge they stated that it was for minibar charges  We had not used the minibar and no one had been in my room to check the minibar usage The staff was distracted and unaccomodating  The room was only okay  Overall I was not satisfied with my stay and I will reserve at Swissotel which I have stayed in and LOVED the next time I overnight in the city  
N => Not the  Grand  hotel they want you to believe    A so called grand hotel that fails to live up to its moniker  As a HHonors member I tend to stay in Hilton properties   but NEVER this property again  Shameless for what they charge  Furthermore I was upgraded to the Executive floor    Ive stayed at Hampton Inns that were better   much better Sounds petty   but no hair dryer 
N => Worst hotel ever Truly this must be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  Ever This is my staydrive to the valet parking greeted with a smile and the bell boy comes along quotYou do not need help with your bags rightquot Not the nicest of things to say I believe The lobby staff mainly bell boys are just standing there giggling to one another and making quotstquot comments that you can hear perfectly well  They look more like teenagers with time to spare rather than staff member of what is supposed to be a landk of Chicago All the staff seems to be bothered by whatever request you make and a simple question on the phone to Guest Services quotWhat time does the Breakfast service stop at the restaurantquot gets you this reply quotI am not sure but it must be some time around  quot  You have to ask them to confirm and then they do This last example should illustrate perfectly well my stay it is  AM and I am in the lift ready to come down to reception  I am carring two suitcases and a laptop roller case  items in total  When the doors are closing a bell boy gets in the lift quotDid you have a nice stay Sirquot I Say quotActually No it has been rather dissapointingquot  He replies quotWe will have to do better next timequot  We arrive at the lobby level and I drag my  pieces of lugage to the hall so far he has not volunteered any help  I keep draging my luggage around the carpeted lobby floor lugage does not slide on carpet you so have to pull and he the bell boy manages to stay  steps behind me the whole walk to reception it is about  yards from the lift  He has managed to NOT HELP at all and as soon as he makes it to the Front Desk he sneeks back into the back office So much for service specially after I had told him my stay had not been a pleasant one This is the service you get at the Hilton Chicago  
N => Not So Much    Check in was good   they even upgraded my room to a suite with  bathrooms  The room size was ent for downtown but this  have just been because they upgraded my room  I booked this hotel based on some of the reviews mentioning that it had been newly reated  I dont think they had gotten to my room yet   or it was just outdated already by about  years  Id give it a  out of  on the cleanliness scale  I noticed a large brown stain on the bedding the morning AFTER I had slept in the bed  Pretty gross  I did like the location view staff and the fact that I could open the windows  This was particularly nice when the strong smell of smoke drifted into my room through the vents  Stay was okay but not worth the cost  I will not stay here again  
N => Dont leave any valuables out in the open I left my iPod and PDA out to charge and strangely enough had only my iPod stolen  Ill assume the moron who took it couldnt make heads or tails of it whereas the iPod is fairly easy to spot  Anyway I was expecting to be reimbursed almost without question as the incident was reported immediately upon discovering that they had been stolen quite the opposite occurred actually  After an quotinvestigationquot to determine whether the locking mechanism had failed or not they determined that they were not responsible  I was in shock initially  Were talking about a rd generation  gb iPod here  The insurance companys argument was simple they were not responsible period  They said that as part of their investigation they had interrogated their staff and found them completely innocent of any wrongdoing  As if anyone would own up to that  What a wonderful world wed live in indeed  I asked the agent to let ME interrogate them to which they responded with no  I made it clear to them that regardless of their policy they had essentially accused me of lying and fraud  Their agent did their best to deflect that statement but the definition was a black and white one  Now I do quite well in my profession and could purchase my own iPod  Thats simply not the issue here  One assumes that there is some level of protection to ones personal belongings when staying at a hotel  Apparently at the Hilton there isnt  Im insulted to say the least  Regardless if you do ide to stay there please be aware that the staff are thieves and that the hotel will in fact support them while accusing you if the situation ever arises  
N => ent found the hotel too big  here for a conference and it was tough to find the meeting rooms  ent rooms for an old hotel  staff was not helpful as to the general area  
N => Staff very accomodating There were several instances while staying at this hotel that we either needed something in addition to what they offer or we needed personal assistance  One each instance the hotel staff went above and beyond to be accomodating  The rooms do not have microwaves or refrigerators  I asked if they could bring us a refrigerator and they did so free of charge  They said they do not run the shuttle to Magnificent Mile any longer and I expressed my concern with this bc cab fare one way is around   wo a tip  They allowed me to turn in my receipts for a cash refund from the cab company  This was because I planned my trip depending on the shuttle running to and from the Magnificent Mile several times a day The concegire was very helpful  giving us maps and other wonderful suggestions  Take advantage The weekends at the hotel were very very crowded in the lobby area which makes dining in the restaurants downstairs less than peaceful  Staying during the week was nice The hotel is very close to the art museum which was niceI would recommend to any traveler to bring water to your hotel room bc the bottles on site are  in the room and  in the hotel lobby  You need to plan for cash for a cab to the Magnificent Mile or bring sneakers to make the   mile walk each way  The cab rides add up very quickly bc you are paying to sit in traffic on the way there and back There are many Walgreens and other grocers to bring stuff back to your room which you  want to do bc of the pricey hotel items  
N => Service not what it use to be We just returned from a stay at this hotel  We have gone to this hotel every year for the last  yrs  The hotel is beautiful service is great     but this year we were alittle disappointed  The room was ok lots of reating going on  The food was not as good as normal  We always do the breakfast buffet   best deal for your money   there was no omelets when we asked about this they said it was due to the fact the numbers are down in the hotel so many of the normal food items were not available this weekend  We also noted that normally there is a shuttle to the shopping district  again this weekend it was not available  The hotel is very nice and you can get great deals on the web  But overall this year we were not as happy with the hotel as in previous visits  Our group has ided to try again next year just to see if this was just an off weekendquot for the hotel  which we hope it was The past  years have been great  
N => Just got back Just got back from Chicago after spending  Nights at the Hilton  Our room was at the back of the hotel though very nice clean the beds I believe were not very big for American standards i would say it was an english ft in though we did have  bathrooms  There was a constant sound of Metro Trains but you did get use to it  The swimming pool and Gym were both excellant PricesA bottle of Water in the room Breakfast Taxi to OHare Storage of Luggage  per item Would recommend 
N => Chicago Hilton eases athon Meltdown My family recently stayed at the Chicago Hilton on S  Michigan Ave during our visit to the city for the  Chicago athon  Even though the cityhotel were full of visitors for this event the hotel staff made us feel welcome  Rooms are spacious and we were pleasantly surprised to find  bathrooms in our double room  We arrived early to the hotel am and were allowed to check in immediately  Rooms was spacious clean amp quiet  Staff was attentive and provided almost immediate response to a problem with mini bar our key didnt work  The bar Kitty OSheas I believe was convenient and offered a nice place to relax for drinks as we were always able to find a seat  My only complaint is that we were forced to pay  per bag to check luggage  Usually it is my experience that this ammenity is on a quottip basisquot for hotel guest  Location was convenient for the athon just across from Grant Park but a bit south of Magnificant Mile  Use the train system if youre not in a hurry  We rode several times and found it to be clean amp safe  Hotel staff amp CTA staff were helpful with directions  
N => Couldnt ask for more We went on a girls trip to take my best friends dhter to American Girl  We looked at so many hotels and couldnt make up our mind because of prices answer to that was Priceline  We got an excellent rate that was more than half off of what they were asking on there website  Once we arrived we were so impressed  This hotel is huge You would never guess from looking at the outside  We got there pretty late after midnight  So check in was very easy for us  Our room was gorgous  A double with  bathrooms  Which came in alot of handy with a room of  girls  Beds were extremely comfortable and the water super hot Once we got our bearings of where we were it was very easy to get around  We did alot of walking but I must say I enjoyed it  If your tired of walking theres always a bus taxi or trolley close by to get you where your going  I would definitely w out a doubt stay here again for our next Chi Town adventure 
N => Perfect Stay The Hilton Chicago was simply perfect  The room was a good size but not as large as your chain hotels generally offer We were on the executive floor thanks go to a Gold upgrade  The evening reception was nice but all alcoholic drinks were quite expensive at about   each  Also the breakfast was kind of well pathetic  Comparing this to say the Hilton Toronto it needs improvement  In Toronto Hilton offered all drinks for free as well as a spread that was more than acceptable for a light meal  However the room was comfortable and spottless and all of the employees we encountered were friendly and helpful The only downside to this hotel is charge for leaving your bags  If you want to check your luggage for any amount of time youll be charged  bag  If you dont want to leave right away its cheaper to have your car brought up by the valet then have them return it  Just tip for the serviceIll stay at this hotel again I just dont recommend paying for the executive floor  
N => Disappointing for the Cost We were disappointed with our recent stay for two nights at the Hilton Chicago  We paid more to stay here wanting higher quality in both room and service  We received neither  The reservation for a king room was changed without reason to a double  Our phone didnt work  The non smoking room smelled of stale smoke and the overall property was weathered  The front desk could have been friendlier  Nothing terrible just not worth the money  In addition we thought the hotel was too far from the river as we seemed to be there often  The walk was too much three or four times a day  Id recommend the Four Points Sheridan if you want to stay in the quotrealquot downtown  
N => Enjoyable stay I spent  days here attending a Conference so my enjoyment was probably added to by spending time with friends  It is certainly a large impressive building  I did not have a view but my bedroom and bathroom were large and clean  I was surprised to find I could plug in a hairdryer right next to the sink and chose to use a bedroom plug  It was disappointing not to have use of a fridge unless I paid extra  The coffee making machine did not work with tea bags the tea tasted of coffeeI used The Pavilion to eat a lot and was very impressed with the buffett  Good varied choice including as much fresh fruit as you wanted  One morning I was tempted to order from the menu   chocolate toast and maple syrup   delicious but expensive as you then pay extra for tea orange juice etc  Also used Kitty OSheas for snacks and drinks It was lovely to be able to step outside the hotel and across to the park for a break hotel is excellent location for the parks sculptures fountains Art museum  There are many other attractions in walking distance The pool is not as nice as it looks in the hotel picture but adequate  I was disappointed it closed at pm instead of   On the last but one day in my room no fresh toiletries or towels were provided or empty tissues refilled which I thought was a bit mean I still had  hours to stay Bellboys were very busy when I wanted to leave and I had an electrician knock on my door and take me and my cases in the service elevator as they were clearing my floor for maintenance so felt a bit rushed The last night a large number of Conference attendees were taken ill  Food poisoning was suspected from the closing banquet but since then the Chicago Dept of Public Health have informed them it was probably a norovirus Apart from that unfortunate ending I had a great time but would personally probably prefer the Hilton Garden Inn over the Chicago for personal use if I could then eat at the Pavilion 
N => Beautiful Hotel Great Staff My husband and I attended a convention at this hotel for three days and extended our visit to Chicago three more days the hotel was generous to offer the same quotconventionquot rate to our room for the additional days  We loved the hotel the or is a reminder of the early days of luxury hotels and the staff still treats this gem with tender loving care  From the friendly reception staff to the sweet housekeeper we felt as though we were leaving friends when we checked out  Dont miss an opportunity to experience this grand dame of a hotel in downtown Chicago 
N => Overall a good stay I stayed here with a group of girlfriends during the taste of chicago We got a deal through priceline as well  I had no problems during checkin and the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant Our room was small compared to some  star hotels but on the plus side it did have  bathrooms and was very clean The location was perfect as it was directly acrross the street to the tasteOn the downside   The internet was  a day and parking was expensive  Housekeeping did come to clean the room one day and we asked them to come back  They said they would come back later that afternoon and never did  We had to call housekeeping the next day to have someone come up to clean and get new towels Overall I would stay here again 
N => Keep It Movin I was far from impresssed  This is NOT an appropriate hotel for a tourist  Impersonal and way too vast  They also charge an arm and a leg for EVERYTHING  They even went as far to charge me to keep my luggage for three lousy hours And of course I had to tip the guys on top of that   fee per luggage piece  Outrageous  They charge for everything which might be okay if you are on an unlimited expense account but not for a traveler  They even charge to use the internet which is totally uncalled for  I never experienced this but I hear it is typical of these large hotel chains  The room was large enough and the bed was comfortabel  That being said the bathroom was very worn and old looking  Not well maintained with a light out and chipped sink  Not up to Hilton standards thats for sure  Location is good enough however I could not wait to get out of there as it was kaos everyday with some convention going on and massive stream of people cutting you off on your way to the elevator or exiting  I would not stay there again thats for sure  Pass on this one and quite frankly keep in moving  
N => chicago hilton  excellent went to chicago for a week in  ided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton we were not disapointed  perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying  or  nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level  we had  double beds with a bathroom each  they bedsand pillows were too die for so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles  all the staff were very helpful  a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps thatwhy some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful  about  blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called quotOrangequot which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast the cafe and the staff are suberb  expect a  min wait on a sat amp sun morning  
N => Hilton Staff Disrespectful to Women Last weekend was my husbands and my anniversary of over twenty years  His company had hosted three days of an annual meeting there and I was to and arrive on the last dayenjoy a celebration dinner and spend time in the city Sunday  My husband had left an envelope with my name at the front desk in case my arrival was prior to the the meetings end  When I politely asked at the desk they refused to hand me the envelope and claimed it wasnt there  They sent me to the bell captain who said he would not allow me to meet my husband without calling and asking his consent  When my husband replied with quotof course she should come upquot the attendant waitedand as he walked toward the elevators lhed and said in surprise quothe said its okay to let you up About half an hour later we came downstairs dressed for dinnermy husbnad asked for the envelope with my name written on it and they reached over and picked it up  Then they said they would add my name to the hotel room and referred to me as thisthis woman  when asking my name  How much more insulting were they going to be It was hard to believe that this was the same formerly high caliber hotel where years before I had made my debutand attended many respectable functions  Has Conrads Hilton become a house of Ill reputeD P  Lake Forest IL 
N => Busy Hotel Convention Hotel Stayed during a convention   I requested a  bedroom  bath room  The first room I was given on my Thurs   Sunday stay was on the quotback sidequot of the hotel with a quotView of the Cityquot This view included the quotLquot elevated train stop   and about every  minutes on the th floor was grating on my nerves  I called to find out if I could change rooms  They were able to accommodate me   I had to come down to the front desk but was assigned a room nearer to the elevator bank   but no view which meant to me   quiet and I had to transfer my luggage etc by myselfWe took advantage of the Chicago Bus System  I went to their website httpwww transitchicago com to plan our trip  I also found reading the signs by the bus stops very helpful  I took the   train from in front of the HIlton to the Art Institute and from there I would walk a block west to State Street shopping from Macys I would take the   to the Mag Mile American Girl Place just a block from the Water Tower Place  The Bell Hop station has wonderful maps with the information on itI was disappointed that the Pool closed at pm and they charge extra for everything internet servcie use of the gymmachines Disney Channel    but it is probably standard operating procedures for Convention hotels in the City 
N => Excellent   highly recommend The staff was incredibly accomodating They got us a room at the last minute and the concierge helped us find local places to eat and printed our boarding passes for us  The room was great and the beds were comfy  We never ate in the hotel to save money but walk down Mich  Ave and you will find excellent places  Great location  They have a free shuttle service to the Magnificent Mile  We couldnt have asked for a better stay  Well   be if the elevators were a little bit more timely  
N => A little disappointing I should have done more research before staying at this Hilton  The location was not that convenient for hanging out on the Magnificent Mile and after walking around the city I saw plenty of other interesting options  Also I found the room small and a little stale   a reation might be in order  On the plus side the service was good and the hotel was clean  All in all not bad but a little disappointing  
N => Ehh not very impressed First of all the location was not that great  There was hardly anything within walking distance in terms of food and it seemed like a sketchy area overall  We had to take a taxi to get to the Mag Mile and it was a pain  I will say that we had a nice view of the Lake but our room was right over Michigan Ave south and it was very loud  We did not get much sleep the entire stay   to top that off there must be one control for Heat or AC because the heat was on and we were so hot we had to open the windows to tolerate it which made it even noisier  As for the room itself it was the smallest hotel room Ive ever stayed in  Basically room for a king size bed dresseramp desk and not much else  It was crowded for two people  We were also given a smoking room which is not what we requested  The hotel just seemed very old which it is there are  arate elevators and the place is huge and not very personal  The continental breakfast was not exciting either and it was so crowded we couldnt even find a place to sit We were able to walk to the Shedd Aquarium which was nice but other stuff we wanted to do required taxis   So overall   I would stay somewhere else in a better location  
N => Wonderful We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton   I am so glad we did the hotel was clean hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing  We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny  
N => Loved The Hilton Though we live in Chicago my girlfriend and I ided to get a room at the Hilton since the hotel was hosting a function we attended that night  No complaints at all about the stay  Im a Hilton Honors member and not only was check in a breeze but we were upgraded to a two bed two bath room on the Executive Level at no additional charge  The room was an okay size  I think we lost a little space with that second bathroom but Ill take the second full bath any day  All amenities were of the highest quality and the bed and bedding were top notch  Our bags were brought up just minutes after our arrival  Overall a very pleasant stay and a very good value for the downtown location  I would return to this hotel and would recommend it to others  
N => convenient   nothing specialpost stay customer service could use improvement Stayed here on a Saturday night  Didnt use any hotel services so cant comment on those  The door staff were great  I recieved an upgrade from a two bed one bathroom to a two bed two bathroom room  Of course my luck the shower in my bathroom was broken so I ended up having to use the other one thankfully I did have that option The only negative experience I encountered was post stay in that I received a charge on my credit card for a dinner at the restaurant on the eve of the day I checked out  While this was dealt with quickly upon calling the hotel a few days later the person I spoke to did not go out of their way to apologize for the inconvenience  I also got a sense from the tone of voice and the general manner with wich the person interacted with me that their going in attitude was this was a correct credit card charge and that it was going to be to me to prove otherwise  Luckily for me it was easy If you are a walker then the walk to and from Giordanos Pizzeria on Rush is definitely doable allowing you to experience Michigan Avenue  
N => Enjoyed our Stay I traveled to Chicago the first week of ust with my wife and two children  We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the musuems  It was definately the right choice I did not have any of the problems the previous reviewers had  We stayed on an executive floor paid night avg by calling direct to hotel  So I am not sure the impact the executive floor had on our service  Check in took less than  minutes  Our bags were delivered to the room shortly after we got there  Anyone that travels to Boston or NYC on a regular basis will consider these rooms more than spacious  We had two full bathrooms which is great for traveling with kids The rooms were very clean linens excellent and all the furniture in very good shape  My only concern is that the doormen are not very knowledgeable about thier city  I cannot comment on the hotel food because we like to sample a citys offering  There are several excellent venues within a few blocks to get a bite to eat I would recommend this hotel to either business or family travelers  
N => not nearly as good as expected I was very disappointed by this hotel as I and all my friends had always figured Hilton  luxurystyle and while the hotel itself has great potential to offer both these things unfortunately they choose not to capitalise on this potential  To begin with it took just over mins to check in we received no help with our bags  women on a shopping week have plenty and it was virtually impossible to get anyone at reception to help with any queries and in a very impersonal hotel like this the only helpful person I could find was the man at the baggage check  Probably was SO disappointed in this hotel because when in Chicago the previous summer had stayed in the much more personal comfortable and central Sofitel so this summer guess which one Ill be going back to   Not to hard to figure out ehThe one good thing I have to say about the Hilton was the breakfast in the restaurant opposite the check in was absolutely fantastic  
N => Amazing Hotel Totally wonderful historic hotel  I booked this hotel on Hotwire for  to surprise my husband for his birthday  He thought I must have paid a fortune  It was a beautiful hotel and the staff could not have been more friendly  The hotel was completely modern but retained that historic feel  I agree with previous reviews that the bathroom is a bit small compared to other luxury hotels but no big deal  The bed was one of the most comfortable Ive ever slept in and besides the occasional sound of the El was very quiet  The breakfast buffet was amazing but a bit pricey  It was a bit of a walk to other restaurants but the area was very safe and cabs or train was readily available  There was a free shuttle all day to the Magnificenat Mile shopping area  I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
N => Stay Far Away Recent stay will be our last  First we were put in a large suite with lake views requested a non smoking room checked into room and was sickened by the smell of smoke  Went back to check in desk and were told again it was a non smoking room once we told them there were ashtrays on every table they moved use to another much smaller but clean room  In the smaller room the heat did not work was fixed by a maintenance worker who told us it was blowing air conditioning not heat  Bed was comfortable bathroom was ok views from both rooms were terrific  Check in was a  minute wait  people working and  in line  Pool was so bad even my child wouldnt swim in it  Room service for  sandwich  beer and an omelet cost   Although my family member said the HIlton Sandwich was one of the best he ever had  This hotel has a history and beauty almost unrivaled in Chicago however it has not been maintained and is now in a sad state of disrepair  MUCH better hotels in Chicago  
N => met expectations Stayed il  amp  with a pretty good rate found through TravelAxe  Checked in late so king room was not available front desk said they would put us on the list to change the next day when they expected many checkouts  Room had  bathrooms both with very limited counter space  This is a common gripe we have with many hotels  Breakfast was expensive but good typical for this level hotel  We ordered from the menu but they also have a buffet The next afternoon we were able to move into a king  Its bathroom was about the same  This room was on the back side of the building on the th floor  We had some noise from the quotElquot but the windows and curtains filtered it pretty well Location is convenient  We walked to the Shedd Aquarium and walked back from shall Fields on Wabash amp Washington  
N => Average Hotel    When I visited Chicago for the first time the quotHiltonquot brand seemed like a safe bet  I remember having seen it in that Harrison Ford movie Fugitive   and it looked nice  When I arrived I was surprised at how old it was  It is an extremely old hotel   but appears to have been relatively well maintained The line at check in was LONG   but I was impressed at how quickly the line was moving  Kudos to the front desk staff The room was average  Not great   not bad  It was quite large    I got one with two double beds as I was staying there with a friend of mine not my spouse Didnt eat in the restaurants   just got orange juice and a danish at their coffee counter  Service was quick   prices were fair On my next trip to Chicago I would certainly explore other hotels before I would return to the Chicago Hilton  
N => Met expectations We stayed here over a long weekend for a convention  The rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable  The staff we met were always very friendly  Our room faced away from the lake and we could hear the train L pass  It wasnt enough to wake you but it was noticeable  Parking was  per night  
N => Convenient great Pool but Reservation Problem Despite having confirmed my reservation with a credit card when I arrived there were no rooms available consistent with my reservation  The desk staff were not helpful  Ultimately I was placed in a room not usually used and directly under the kitchen  Until very late and again early in the AM the very loud sound of rumbling rolling carts made sleep impossible  The next morning it took my making a few trips back to the desk becoming aggressive and getting to the manager to get resituated in a room that met the reservation  Though I was given a breakfast coupon at the hotel coffee shop  a extensive and good buffet the incident really got my vacation off to a bad start  Otherwise it is a convenient location walking distance to the Art Institute Buddy Guy Blues Club Lake Michigan and its parks shopping as well as convenient for various public transportation connections  Having a pool was a definite plus on the hot muggy ust days I stayed there  Elegant lobby areas make one feel extravagant even when taking advantage of weekend discounts  
N => Very disappointed Checked in to the hotel at  pm on  after making on line reservations on the Hilton website and paying for the  rooms in advance  One room was fine but the other was a total disaster  Had not been cleaned smelled of urine in the carpet vomit in the bathtub debris everywhere  Staff seemed concerned but could not find adjoining or close by room as reserved  Promised to quotmake it rightquot and move us the next day  Returned to hotel at pm the next day and they wanted to assign us the same room  Said housekeeping supervisor had personally cleared it  Bell Captain staff took our luggage to the room opened the door and refused to go in  Still smelled of urine  Fortunately Bell Captain staff was able to find us another room as front desk seemed unable to do the job  HHonors manager promised to refund to our credit card immediately  Never done  When contacted HHonors manager said a check was being issued for the cost of the nd room for both nights  Its been  days and still no refund  Never stay at this hotel I even provided digital photos to the HHonors manager to show the terrible condition of the room   
N => Beautiful historic hotel nice location My husband and I stayed t    We were not part of the HUGE convention we took a trip away wo the kids  Got a great military rate for a nonsmoking King Jr Suite rm   The room was located at the end of the hallway of the middle tower facing Balbo Dr  we could see the lake and the fountain and the tracksCheck in Quick as it seems we got there before all the conventioneers though they do offer several self check in kiosks with a credit card  Bell hops were ready and willing to help us with our  bag  I noticed they did not offer a wet bar keyhotelRooms beautiful  hallways seemed a little dark but it was part of the ambiance  Elevators were fine even thought the hotel was booked There are  sets of elevators upper and lower floors  Room was clean nice and quiet  Small living roombar area perfect for our snacks water and sodas  I didnt check to see if the couch was a pull out if we came back out family of four  and  yr old could stay in this type of room comfortably  HUGE TVs in both rooms  The pictures in the review before mine are very similar to the room we stayed in though we had an extraarate living room  Good water pressure and lots of hot water GymPool There was a heat wave during our visit so we welcomed the use of the indoor pool and spa on the th floor  We werent charged the extra  I think bc I am a Hilton Honors member  We did not try the gym but it looked to have several different machines in a nice bright setting  There was a k where several people we laying out  I thought it was odd that they charged for water and lockers when they already charge for the use of the health clubFood did not try it ice machines always full even though hotel was packed Staff always nice and smiling  They did not openly greet us in the hallways but when greeted they warmly responded  Concierge was helpful when I was trying to get directions Since there was a big convention in town it was difficult to find a ent room for under   I had reservation for W city center and this Hilton  I cancelled the W after a Chicagoan pleaded with me to stay at the hilton bc of the beauty of the hotel and the location  We enjoyed it very much  It wasnt a quotheavenly bedquot but a couple evenings without the kids made the stay romantic and heavenly  We were glad we chose this hotel and would stay again  EnjoyHope this helps with your ision  
N => not a perfect  On the check out billing there is a printed message that if your stay isnt quota perfect quot to let the front desk know BEFORE and the word before is bold checking out We went for a business conference amp of course all is true about the hotel being historical amp old  Beautiful ballrooms  Impressive lobby rich with history HoweverWe booked an Executive Room that was on the upper floors under the suites amp had a view of a brick wall opposite us although light did get in the room As we were unpacking we found a pair of mens pants amp socks in a drawer amp were quite disturbed as in quotwhat else hasnt been cleanedquot We called the front desk immediately amp someone came to collect the clothing nothing was really said or apologized from the staff  Upon return that night there was a fruit basket amp card from the manager however there was ALSO a dirty cloth on one of the two beds from what we assumed they used to clean the drawers Disgusted we phoned the front desk amp asked to speak to the manager whose name was on the fruit basket card from the original mishap  He was unreachable and we heard nothing of it afterwards Some days we had a bath mat other days we didnt The hotel gym costs day which is appalling    since when do hotels not include the service in their hotel stayThe staff in general were not overly friendly amp barely smiled The beds were comfortable  There were dead flies on the window sill where they stack towels in the restroom As part of the Executive level we had breakfast included every morning on the th floor cereal granola bagels bottled water yogurt juices pastries one table in particular had a beautiful view of lake michigan  The appetizers in the evening were delicious chicken on skewers amp veggies Given the service or lack thereof I would not pick this hotel ever again  
N => Treated like a third class citizen BEWAREI realize that reserving a room through Hotwire means that I  not receive a room on the nd floor with an amazing view of the lake however I fully expected to at least be given a room with a bed  Upon checking in at  in the afternoon my fiance and I requested a non smoking room  We were told that because we made our reservation through Hotwire we were not guarenteed a specific kind of room  The receptionist went on to say that not only was the hotel overbooked but the only room they were willing to offer us was the living room of a suite equipped only with a pull out sofa bed She kept insisting that it was a lovely room with an amazing view but I said I was more concerned about having a place to sleep than I was about looking at the lake Im from Milwaukee I see the lake everyday  She left and spoke with a manager but came back unapologetic with no alternative  Normallly I would have sat on the counter until the problem was fixed but being newly pregnant all I wanted to do was lay down  The view was great but for  I couldve slept on my own much more comfortable sofa  I travel quite a bit and have never been treated like this  I will not go back  
N => Outstanding hotel We stayed at the hotel Friday night    We had read other reviews on this site that indicated some difficulties at this property but our experience was exceptionally good  There were no delays in checking in they even had lemonade available in case there had been a delay there wasnt  We arrived before noon but were soon accomodated in a beautiful large room with two queen sized beds and two bathrooms  We attended a meeting in the hotel and everything was done in an outstanding fashion  Would stay there again in a heartbeat 
N => Average hotel We stayed at the Hilton Chicago for  nights in il  Although the hotel itself was beautiful the rooms were rather small  Literally there was barely enough room to move around the bed  As others have stated the bed was very comfortable though  The location was okay   quite a way down Michigan Avenue  
N => Very Plesant Had a  night lay over in Chicago whilst on business stayed in the Hilton and Towers as a HHonours Gold card member you get free upgrades to Executive floor and the rooms were very nice not huge but enough    The beds were very comfortable indeed The area around hotel was a bit rough i would rather stay up near the Sofitel but if you like Blues the Buddy Guys Legends right across the street was fantastic good music good food etc etc This hotel was AOK with me  
N => Short but well up to standard We had a stop over in Chicago on the way to Vancouver so our time was short  The room was of a good size and the king bed was just right  I thought the hotel was in a good position and we enjoyed the lakeside views on a lovely crisp sunny winters day  I was disappointed that there were no stores open but we liked Chicago and this hotel  Both have history and a sense of style  The staff were welcoming and pleasant  We could not criticise them I have read other comments on this Hilton and can only say if you ever travel to the UK you wont know what has hit you  The Hilton staff did everything I expected of them and we enjoyed being first served at breakfast next morning before leaving for our flight A good stay and we would like to have had longer  
N => Great hotelgreat stay but    Beautiful surroundings  Very ornate with breathtaking staircase ble countertops chandeliers and gold fixtures  Great stay  However we were quoted two prices over the phone upon scheduling our reservation  night for a room with  double beds without a view of the lakeand   for a lake view room  Upon arriving we were told the room charge was   without a lake view and this was not negotiable  Also charged for internet access which we did not use this was removed from our bill per our request  The pool was lovely but a bit chilly and  of the  hot tubs was out of order  The staff was friendly and helpful  Luggage storage for a minimal fee was a nice feature  Overall great stay  
N => Underwhelming and disappointing    We stay in downtown Chicago quite often and ided to try this hotel  Of course   a beautiful lobby  But beyond that we encountered disappointment after disappointment  Tried to check in early and was told that the only available rooms for immediate check in were smoking  We ided to wait bc a non smoking room was important to us  Clerk took down my cell number and told me shed call as soon as our room became available  Never called  Checked back in the late afternoon and though the clerk did not mention this he sent us to a smoking room  This was not just slightly smokey   it smelled like someone had just spent the past two hours smoking as many cigarettes as possible with the windows shut  I asked to be transferred and they front desk clerk told me there was nothing he could do except send housekeeping to ionize and was not pleasant about it  Finally after talking to housekeeping and essentially begging for another room she switched us  Rooms were small and sub par for a quot starquot hotel  Carpet was old and shabby room temperature was either really hot or really cold  Service at hotel bar in lobby was awful  THey made my husband the wrong drink and instead of re making it   just poured additional ingredients on top of the tini  So it tasted like a salty citrus tini   very gross  They did not offer to comp the drink  They charge for EVERY little extra you can think of  If you need to check your bags   you have to pay for each bag   most nice hotels will store your bags at no additional cost  Essentially   not worth the cost   the experience was closer to that of a  star  Very uncharacteristic of a Hilton     
N => Never Again Stayed during very warm fall weather in   During the night the air conditioning quit working  I called the desk and  hour later maintenance came up and fiddled with the equipment  He said he found the problem but it would take awhile to cool down  It never did  It was a miserable night my wife and I could barely sleep due to the heat  I complained and we were switched to another room the next night Once again around am the room heated up unbearably  I didn t bother to call maintenance as it became apparent to me that the problem was not in just one room  If not for the cross ventilation of the two windows in our new room we would have had another miserable sleepless night  Other than the air conditioning problem it was just a run of the mill overpriced hotel with a pretty lobby  
N => Sleeping Babies left on the Curb at  P M  We arrived at  P M  with two prepaid rooms  The hotel was overbooked but they said they would find two rooms for our family of   After  hour the Hotel located rooms and said the rooms would take an hour to clean  We asked for a guarantee that the rooms would be ready if we went to dinner and they thanked us for our patience  At  P M  the Hotel reported that the rooms were still not clean  After we waited   hours for the prepaid rooms the rooms were still not ready  Our small children were ready for bed with no place to sleep  After another  hour the Hotel gave up on the two rooms and we were given a suite with two bedrooms and a spacious entertaining area we thought a good ending to a challenging day    P M  there was a knock at the door and we were asked to leave   the room had been promised to a bridal party  The Hotel Management promised they would do whatever we wanted if we would leave the room  In deference to the Brides once in a lifetime event we thought incorrectly that the hotel had alternative accommodations for us  Unfortunately we ended up on the curb with our bags and pajama clad children at  P M  Our children finally went to sleep on the hard wooden floor of a friends apartment at  A M The Hotel made a terrible mistake in judgment when they put small children in their pajamas out on the street  The Hotels actions were inexcusable and changes need to be made to the Hotels policy  If Hotel Management does respond to this post I pray that it is an apology  Thank you for reading this   the written story does not capture the awfulness of the situation  
N => Luxery plus location and good price The price was right and the location was perfect for easy access to the museums and parks  The hotel lobby was luxurious the Buckingham Restaurant was pricey but very good and the hotel was extremely accommodating  Even though check in was not till  p m  our room was available at  a m  and they let us have it  When we checked out we still had an afternoon of sightseeing planned and the hotel offered a great luggage storage service for only bag We were able to check our luggage after we check out of our room and continue our day without having to lug bags around  During the summer months there is a free San Francisco trolley type bus right across the street from the hotel that travels to the museums shopping and Union Station  The only small issue which we did not inform the hotel of was that it was obvious that the previous tennants had smoked in our non smoking room  Otherwise the hotel was perfect 
N => Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel from     I thought it was great  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful  The beds were very comfortable  The view from our room wasnt anything special but then again I didnt go to Chicago to look out the window of my hotel room  The complimentary shuttle to North Michigan was very nice to have  If you dont mind walking a bit its a good idea to get dropped off on the way north end and just shop your way back to the hotel  Another note  the blue line train station is within walking distance which can save you time and money when coming from the airport  For  people to take a shuttle from the airport it was  and it took about an hour and a half  When we used the train to get back to the airport   mins it was  a person Overall it was a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again  
N => overpriced with bugs and rude staff   never again We ided to quotsplurgequot on the Chicago Hilton amp Towers it was the most money Ive ever spent on a hotel and the WORST hotel experience Ive ever had  When we arrived they had to search for a room for us we had asked for two queens to accommodate the three members of our family we stood there for  minutes while the woman tried to find us a room   I was really afraid we were going to end up on the street I believe we had such trouble because we booked through a travel agency   I ve heard this happens when you book through an agency by the way I had to print my confirmation off in the hotel s business office   cost me   We ended up with a King  roll away and a nice view at no extra charge  Good start until we got to the room which was infested with bugs For our trouble we were moved to a smaller room with a view of the ghetto  The guy who brought us the key to our new room was very rude and barely acknowledged us  We asked him about the roll away and he ignored us   we had to call twice before they finally brought it to our room  It was midnight before we were squared away  No one on staff bothered to check out the bugs or offer anything other than a half hearted apology  Parking was day and the attendant was very rude  There are no ent places to eat within reasonable walking distance  And the level of panhandlers seems to be higher than in other areas of Chicago  Typically I m not one to complain   all I need is a place to lay my head at night   but I d rather not do it on an expensive bug infested pillow  I can t stress enough not to stay at this dump 
N => Chicago Hilton Towers  Beyond Expectations I had to travel to Chicago on business and ided to stay at the Chicago Hilton Towers because it was close to my meeting site the next day  My husband accompanied me as well so he could sight see while I was attending to business  Our room Tower Floor was not ready for check in when we arrived at  PM  The Exec Floor Concierge Adriana asked us to enjoy a soda or cup of coffee in the lounge while we waited for our room to be prepared  Adriana let us know when the room was ready and because of our inconvenience it was only about  minutes we were upgraded to a King Room with a SuiteParlor  What a TREAT after a hectic drive into the city  The staff at the hotel was wonderful  The rooms were immaculate  It was the highlight to my recent business travels  Thank you Hilton Towers for going above and beyond this road warriors expectations   stars for Adriana and the Hilton Staff  
N => Customer no more We purchased two rooms at the Hilton as we were planning on attending the Taste of Chicago with some friends  We had a late start leaving Milwaukee and did not arrive at the hotel until around pm  According to the information that we were given from Priceline we were guaranteed a late check in  When we arrived there was some big event being held at the hotel and it took quite a bit of time for us to get to the check in counter  Once we were finally helped about a half hour later we were told that there were no rooms available even though we had reservations and had paid in advance  We asked for a manager and he told us that Priceline customers are not priority and had we arrived sooner we  have gotten a room  Ive used Priceline many times before at various hotels and not once have I ever been told that I wasnt a priority because I received a discount We were absolutely floored  The manager later retracted his statement and said that there were rooms available but we would have to wait about an hour for them to be cleaned  That would have been around midnight  My fiance went back and forth with him about how much of an inconvenience this was and he eventually sent us to the Embassy Suites downtown instead  He also assured us that we would be receiving a letter in the mail to come back to stay with them for free which we have gotten but Im not so sure that Id be willing to go back there even if it is for free  At least some of you got to actually see the rooms    we never even got that far  
N => Not for the budget conscious We booked this hotel through Priceline com I was totally excited when I got this hotel for only   per night  Well the staff is friendly and helpful   Donald at the concierge desk helped us to find some great places to visit  The night before our arrival we stayed at the Hampton Inn in Calumet there we had a fridge and a microwave and an indoor pool and the most wonderful FREE breakfast for my whole family  At the Hilton and Towers you get NOTHING but your room when we checked in we were told we didnt have a room with a view but for   more per night we could have one They werent kidding either our room was in one of the alcoves we had a view of the brick hotel it was as if we were viewing our room though a mirror NO VIEW at all This was disappointing the room was tiny barely enough room to walk around the beds  Because we purchased our room on Priceline and not with our credit card we had no mini bar privledges which was a tiny little tv stand that was locked and had a x inch fridge that was LOCKED You couldnt use it  We were here for  nights and no where to put any food or soda pop to keep it cool They have pop machines in the hall but a soda will cost you    The snacks in the mini bar were utterly outrageously priced eg a standard size bag of M amp Ms was   Room service is offered a club sandwich is   plus a   gratuity charge plus a   delivery charge plus a standard    tax It cost us   for valet parking per night  This was not a hotel for families we could have easily spent   just for lunch  The hotel itself IS beautiful inside and out the pool is awesome  I wont stay at this hotel again with my family I would stay again if it were just my husband and myself   
N => a super place Stayed here in ch for a wedding reception  Check in desk very accomodating and quick  only  of  rooms was ready and the one room was still occupied  However the staff very quickly reassigned us to another room and gave us  passes for breakfast at the hotel resturant for the inconvience   Rooms were not hugh but having  bathrooms made up for that  or was very nice  The heat was still on and we were unable to turn it off  Air conditioning was not on at all and had to leave the windows open to get comfortable  The ballroom was beautiful  staff excellent Lots of areas to sit and talk around hotel  Bar was ok  pretty noisy though  Easy check out  Parking expensive    but for downtown Chicago not unusual  Lots of wonderful spots for picture taking which was important for the occassion  Price was at a discount but usually much higher  Probably wouldnt stay here if just sightseeing but was great for a special occasion   
N => Friendly Staff First let me say this hotel does not have the atmospher families Not because of the hotel but because of the normal clientele  We were snubbed by many guests  However our large family was treated like royalty during our five day stay by the wonderful hotel staff  All the way from the registration desk personnel to the valet parking My husband was attending a five day convention and ided to bring us along  Two weeks prior we tried to get two adjoining rooms but all of the rooms were booked  We succeeding in getting two adjoining rooms through hotels  However booking through hotels was a nighte  We ended up with one room for the remaining days  We ided to go ahead and proceed with the trip and take a leap of faith that Hilton would accomodate us  Not only did they accomodate us without whining and complaining they found us two adjoining rooms with a lake view at  per room per nightThe staff was very friendly and respectful our entire stay and housekeeping showed up on the clock every morning to pick up after our very messy crowd One huge word of caution     If you are planning to stay anywhere in downtown Chicago and you are a large familiy bring your own food  It is impossible to find parking anywhere in the city especially if you have a large vehicle and if you do find parking youll end up paying   or more for one hour We walked everywhere  The Hilton is about  mile walking distance to the Shedd Acquarium Planetarium and Field Museum and the city has a one year old walkway that you can take all the way from Grant Park to the museums with only having to cross Michigan Avenue  The walkway goes underneath Columbus and Lake Shore Drive Also beware of beggers  We got hit up twice  Either bring spare change with you or be prepared to be strong I walked with six kids to the museums and despite the beggars I felt safe About the Hilton pool       It seems to be little dirty  The water appears to have grease laying on the top of it  I dont know what caused it but the chlorine smell was particularly strong  We all swam however and know one picked anything up  
N => Enjoyable Stay  
N => Vieil h tel qui ne m rite plus sa r putation que par son emplacement  
N => El hotel est  muy bien pero la situaci n no es del todo buena  
N => Not disappointed but not impressed either    Room is comfortable but small Parking is expensive  per night for valet parking Typical American breakfast buffet no much variety  
N => Poor handling of stranded passengers     slow check in even with prior notice of a plane full of passengers meal voucher seems to scare of waiters in restaurant loud air condition no info at the room about the hotel 
N => We Were Happy with Our Stay This hotel has lots of less than optimal reviews  We stayed for one evening and found it to be comfortable   and perfect for what we needed   a place to stay in order to catch a  a m  flight  Check in was smooth and efficient  The room was nice good bed desk area two comfortable chairs and great beds  Bathroom was adequate with tremendous water pressure Other reviewers have commented on inability to control temperature in room  We were able to adjust ours  Room had small coffee maker which was nice  Room was clean and comfortable  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant sorry I cant remember the name   started with an A and it was not very expensive and good  Overall a good stay and I would recommend to anyone needing to stay close to the airport  
N => stayed only because of priceline Had a conference at another airport hotel wound up staying here due to priceline  Had I had a way I would have cancelled and stayed somewhere else  My original plan was to drive to OHare from out of state but whatever savings I got from priceline was completely canceled by the ridiculous parking fee which is day  My whole stay there felt like a classic quotnickle and dimequot experience  There is no free internet ANYWHERE not even in the lobby they use Boingo which has its own valueless pricing schedule  It takes an average of slightly over  minute for guest servicesoperators to pick up the phone  One time I had to wait  minutes  The walls must be thin because my neighbor wasnt happy about hearing my rooms alarm clock going off my fault Sorry whoever you are The HD TV in the room while nice had some dysfunction with the HD channels and remote  The guest service answer quotwere working on itquot    apparently they had been working on it the entire  day stay I was there  Room service while expected to be expensive was even MORE so with the random no good reason MULTIPLE fees they would add on  Typical overpriced hotel food cant really expect much there and typical unimaginative and unhealthy fare  again to be expected  The only pros of this place You couldnt stay any closer to the airport short of sleeping on the terminal floors  Didnt hear any plane noise  And the complimentary Crabtree Evelyn bath products  And bedding was quite comfy  
N => Comfortable Clean and Convenient I had a two night stop over in Chicago with no car and a am flight out on a Saturday  I got off the plane and was in my room in  minutes  of which was the walk from the terminal  For those coming to meet me the hotel was as easy to find as the airport   and the room was a clean and comfortable and quiet respite from commuting around one of the worlds largest metropoli  The desk staff were informative but not overbearing  The quiet of the room was amazing given the proximity to the runway  
N => Meh About the only thing going for it is that it is convenient to the airport  There was little to do there it was not easy to get to the loop  It was soundproofed but still subject to jet noise round the clock  Service was indifferent  Wireless was unreliable  I would stay there again only if I was stranded again at OHare and even then would think twice  
N => Great location otherwise average One night stay from Heathrow en route to Memphis  This hotel is massive Needed to take a convenient monorail train within the airport to reach it  Check in was very smooth and efficient as would be expected from a Hilton  Spacious room with view of runway with airplanes taking off one per minute but no noise must be triple glazed at least As I said the hotel is absolutely huge  Comfortable but in great need of a major orative overhaul to drag it out of the s dark d cor into the current era  We had a nice meal in the restaurant slept very well and set off very refreshed to continue our journey to Memphis   job doneBut not a hotel I would choose for any leisure purpose  
N => Could of found better for the price  squeezed for money at every chance My family of  and our  friends took a short weekend trip to Chicago We were surprised how much a nights stays was in downtown Chicago and ided to stay out side of the big city  We used Hotwire to find us a hotel  It only could find  star which was fine they were around  a night  That was far better than the  a night we were seeing So we picked the lowest price and it placed us in the Hilton on the grounds of the OHare airport  That by itself was not problem What made the stay unpleasant was first the  a night parking  Second after we made the booking we called and confirmed and requested a room with two beds  We were bringing our  children  We were told they cannot reserve a room and if was available when we arrived ok if not to bad So we arrived at  and tried to check in  They said check in is at  and if we wanted to check in early it was an extra  a room The place was dead and lots of empty rooms  Nice huhSo we tipped the bellhop  and they stored our luggage until we could return after  So next we wanted to go out to eat and spend ox  for dinner plate  The information in the room had a list of local restaurants but no information on dinner prices  We asked for advice and the counter people could barley speak any English and had no advice  We asked the bellhop a  year guy who was more than willing to give advice  He repeatedly recommend the restaurant in the hotel and no useful advise on any of the sites in the area  So we needed a taxi the bellhop speaks up no problem he call one on his radio   mins a guy shows up in a new SUV we get in and find it has no meter and a sleazy operator who too can hardly speak English Well we go for a chain restaurant Big horn We gave up on going someplace unique to the area as no one could give advise and I was not going to pay  to use there internet service We get to the restaurant and the drive says  please      Well I left feeling squeezed for every penny they could get  
N => A rip off I had to stay in this hotel because my flight was delayed  It seems to be a recently reated old hotel  My room was on the third floor pretty far away from the elevator yet very noisy  It was clean but very small unit overviewing a parking lot  It seems that all rooms there are facing parkingdriveway  You cant control temperature levels in the room and in my case it was very cold with no option to switch of air conditioning  I was quoted a rate of night for a  double bed room which is a rip off given what you get for your money  Even with a   discount that I got from the airline it is still overpriced  Youd think that for that price Hilton OHare could at least give a you free toothbrush and a newspaper but no expect to pay  plus   service fee for it  
N => Terrible Experience Booked this hotel since I was transiting Chicago for just  hours overnight  All I wanted was a ent meal  I couldnt get itRoom Service simply did not answer the phone and every restaurant in the hotel was packed and wanted  hours to find us a table  I tried telling the restaurant hostesses that I was a guest in the hotel   but that didnt help  Complained at Reception but they were so busy that night they just couldnt care  Tried getting through to a duty manager but failed  None of the hotel phones were being answered that night  First time in my life I failed to get a meal in an otherwise ent hotelThis was about pm and all restaurantskiosks in the airport were closed  Finally found a food court at the International Terminal that was open all night I sent  emails subsequently   one to the hotel GM and one to Hilton  Both remained unanswered An unbelievable experience 
N => Nickel  Firstly the good  Convenient Location walk to terminalsComfy BedRoom seems newly reatedNow the bad  Internet is a steep   I managed without but for   you could log onto the airport wireless service  A basic disposable toothbrush comb and shaver set was   fees   Breakfast starts at   All things that are often free in other hotels  Basically they regard the room rate as a starting point not your final bill  Air con was loud and ineffective  The first room they gave me was a weird shape and behind the lift shafts with a whooshing sound every time a lift went past also a TV that wasnt even viewbale from the bed needing a complaint and a room change  I was suprised they even had the audacity to try and rent that room  Overall when i checked out it was not a satisfying stay and I wouldnt choose to go there again 
N => Makes business travel amazingly convenient I always avoided hotel airports thinking they were horrible places for those bumped off their flights  Well my experience at the OHare Hilton changed all that  It is incredibly convenient to go from gate to hotel back to the gate  The staff was very friendly and concerned about providing good service  The public spaces were spacious clean and welcoming  The food served was tasty amp always with healthy choices  It was easy to make arrangements to leave the airport site to visit local restaurants  The room was large and quiet  Very nice  thanks for chaning my mind about airport hotels 
N => Beware You do not control the temperature of your room  Okay heres the good    and there IS some good    and the BIG bad for me which I hadnt seen described in any of the reviews before I booked  It would have been important to me to know so I am writing this review The good you already know    location location location  If you have an early flight out this is the most convenient place to be the night before that flight  Beds are comfortable  Sound proofing is good  Flat panel TV looked nice but we never turned it on  Check in clerk was very friendly and efficient A couple of quotsmall badsquot are the trash baskets which are quotdesigneryquot but almost unusable due to a very narrow elongated shape    the very high Internet fees and that the airport restaurants are very overpriced with NO other options for you to choose not that you would WANT to eat at the airport but if you did everything is on the other side of the security barrier so those places are not an option  You could catch a cab somewhere I suppose  We had a lot of time to kill and we ided while waiting for the heat to come on more about that next that we might as well take the train back into the city to find dinner and to pick up some food for breakfast as neither of us wanted to pay   for breakfast But the BIG bad about this hotel was bizarre to me    in this over  a night hotel we were not accorded a simple amenity that is common to every low budget motel room in the country    namely the ability to control the temperature in our own room  There is a box on the wall next to the heatingcooling vent that LOOKS like a thermostat    but isnt  It has a dial that says quotWarmerCoolerquot and a fan setting with basically quotOnOffquot and quotLoMedHigh quot However nothing that you do controls room temperature    the only control you have is to turn the fan off I was sick and traveling with a bad cold and had periods of being feverish sweaty and chilled  The room was too cold for me from the outset when we checked in in the afternoon  We turned the dial all the way to warmer and waited for warm air to start coming out of the vent  After  minutes of nothing but cool air we called Guest Services this was around  p m  because we thought we had a defective thermostat and might need to change rooms  The gentleman who answered the phone told me that while the system LOOKS like a room controlled thermostat it is not    basically he said the entire hotel is cooled or heated in a block  He said that the building despite its very modern appearance and rooms was quota very old building quot Right now he explained the hotel was set on quotcoolingquot but would be switched over to quotheatingquot at  or  pm  In the meantime he advised simply turning off the fan entirely to keep cool air from continuing to flow into the room  We did so We kept checking and waiting for heat throughout the evening  By  p m  nothing had changed  I called back to Guest Services and reached a different gentleman who told me that the hotel would switch to heating at  p m This did not happen  I woke up at  in the morning shivering violently with the heat STILL not on  This time I didnt even get an answer when I rang Guest Services  The worst thing was that I HAD to leave the fan on    and thus the cold air blowing on us    all night long so that whenif the hotel finally DID switch over to quotheatquot mode as theyd repeatedly promised and then failed to do wed actually get heat in the room    which we wouldnt if the fan was off My guess based on waking up repeatedly is that the heat finally switched on around  in the morning    i e  about when the hotel might expect its guests to be waking up for earliest flights  They probably assume guests dont notice the temperature while asleep  be this is usually true It was a miserable night for me and I felt particularly upset about being lied to  If the hotels policy is not to turn heat on until  in the morning guest services should not be stringing guests along and assuring them the heat will be coming on early or later in the evening  Id have been unhappy even if I hadnt been sick but particularly under the circumstances Id have appreciated simple honesty from the Hilton staff  Especially by the second time Id called Id have appreciated their offering me a portable room heater or something instead of just shining me on This one quotbig badquot really ruined this hotel experience for me     otherwise Id generally have felt positive about this hotel  If you tend to run cold or hot be aware that you will not have control of the temperature in the room you are paying top dollar for The check out invoice invited us to share our experience and suggestions for improvements with the manager and I will definitely be writing to him or her about this  Ill come back and post again if I get any kind of response I would also like to note that I believe the other hotel we stayed in on this trip    namely the Hampton Majestic in town    is also a Hilton property  That hotel was wonderful in every respect and I will review it arately  I mention that here to make it clear that I have no particular bone to pick with Hilton outside of this miserable experience  
N => Chicago O Hare Hilton   Great if you have an early morning departure We stayed at the O Hare Hilton for one night in early il as we stopped en route to London  We booked directly through Hilton and got a reasonable rate although it was worth being at the airport as we had a am flight and as we had our children with us we didn t want to bother with taxis We arrived about  pm check in time was pm and were given our room straight away although the receptionist did make a point of telling us that he was waiving the early check in fee which I thought was an unnecessary comment given how close we were to actual check in time   still generous of him to not make us wait I suppose  We were given a room on the th floor a Hilton Honours floor which had ent views reaching downtown but it was very compact  There was a nice reclining chair which had just enough room to recline and the bathroom door actually touched the toilet  There was a great   plasma with a good choice of channels although the channel numbers didn t match the list provided on the guide in the room and the beds were comfortable but only a standard double size  We took the L train downtown and had a long afternoon walking around and shopping  It was very easy to get to and from the hotel to downtown but it is odd that you can t get a one day pass for the train at the airport only downtown apparently On return to our room and badly in need of a coffee we discovered that there was no milk in our room so we had to call guest services to ask for some  Thankfully we were brought some within about  minutes but we found it strange that it hadn t been checked earlier The next morning was a breeze getting to the airport as you are already there and if you are travelling domestically you can check in and get your boarding pass in the hotel lobby  If doing another one night stay in Chicago we would stay here again Liked   Location and television Disliked   Compact room although it would be fine for one or two people and there are cheaper hotels close to O Hare  
N => An unexplained  Refreshment  charge    showed up on my account after I returned home since I lined the key to the mini bar I cant find out what this was   and they dont respond to my e mails Other wise everything was ok  
N => V Convenient to airport Like a lot of other reviewers we stayed here courtesy of the airline when we missed out transatlantic connection The location of this hotel for transit travellers just cant be beat right in the middle of OHare its a  minute walk from baggage claim  Being this close obviously means a degree of aircraft noise but not to the extent that it kept us awakeThe check in line for the hotel was long  Not good when you have been delayed and will be home  hours later than planned and since we had vouchers from the airline for check in I dont think we could use the automated systemOnce we got to the room however it was very modern looked newly orated and had a huge flat screen tv We ordered room service and the food was great prices not so great though    for chicken wings pizza and a chocolate cake  Still we were hungry    We didnt use any of the other hotel facilities so cant comment 
N => Great Service I stayed a night at the Hilton OHare Airport for one night due to missing a flight elsewhere I had never been in Chicago before so I was both excited and frightened by being in this large city and because it was my fist time ever missing a connecting flight  We ided to stay at the Hilton due to it being so close to the airport and having to get an early flight We entered the hotel where we received quick assistance and were sent on our way  The hotel is very appealing  The front desk staff was pleasant for the most part It was kind of late and we were very hungry so we ided to go to the property owned restaurant  It was packed so we headed to the bar which was also full with middle aged drunk men and women  I felt so out of place coming from a much smaller city and being underage  If it wasnt for being accompanied by my father I wouldnt have been allowed in So we ided just to go back to our room and purchase room service  Ordering room service was not a breeze  I had to continually repeat myself to the foodampbeverage employee but finally was successful in placing an order  The FampB team was quick and extremely friendly The food was amazingThe room itself was beautiful  My father paid a little over  hundred dollars for the one night stay but I wasnt expecting it to be as lavish as it was  Large LCD television two spacious double beds with the most comfortable duvets and pillows ever I felt as though I came as close has I ever will to sleeping on a cloudThe room and bathroom were extremely clean  The bathroom was large with elegant or flowing nicely with the rest of the room  What else can I say   lots of closet space huge windows large minibar it was great Check out was very easy going as well I loved my stay at the Hilton Chicago OHare Airport 
N => Extras Are Pricey We recently stayed at the Hilton OHare for one night ust    Room was purchased for  plus tax and fees from Hotwire about  total  Positives very clean room nice or large flat panel HD television but no HD stations solid surface counter tops extremely quiet with minimal hotel noise and no noise of planes  Room felt very upscale  Negatives location and prices  The location would be perfect for travelers we however were in town to visit a relative and wanted a night away to celebrate an anniversary  The parking rate is  a night so we were lucky enough to have someone drop us off at the hotel  We stopped at the restaurant and lounge for a cocktail and the prices are sky high A domestic beer is   My husband reminded me we were in a hotel attached to the airport everything is going to be high  We had reservations at Harry Carays Rosemont which is very close to the airport I called the hotel front desk about the shuttle and it was going to be  round trip We ided to take a cab but when we went out to get the cab we found that Harry Carays had a shuttle the restaurant is part of a Holiday Inn Select so they let us ride over to the restaurant just tipped at the end  However we didnt have such a easy trip to get back to the hotel the driver had changed and the new one wasnt so eager to take us back even though he had to go back to the airport to get other passengers  After pretty much refusing to get off the shuttle he took us but told us we quothad to take care of him quot I dont think I would stay here again it just wasnt convenient to leave  I see why they release so many reduced rate rooms to Hotwire they make up for the low cost by getting you in the hotel so you cant leave  Weve had easier times at downtown hotels 
N => Great Airport Location For proximately to the airport and the eL train this location is unsurpassed  The rooms are very small but the beds are comfortable  Water pressure in the shower was nonexistent  When we reported it however it was fixed immediately  During the day the train ride did take an hour I took a book and read  At night we were back in about   We had planned to rent a car but with the closeness of the train and the airport we didnt  We received a great rate on line and it made the train ride worth it  We very quickly learned to use the trains to get to and around the city  We too had an early flight  AM and it was great to just be able to walk over to the airport without having to ride a shuttle return a rental park a car etc  Kiosk in the lobby make check in a breeze  even gives the keys  The same Kiosk machines allow for airport check in and print boarding passes  We used it for both  We did take a taxi out and back in to a local restaurant and fighting the airport traffic to get back to the hotel was difficult  Would I stay here again   definitely  Would I recommend it for others  absolutely  Travelers just need to be aware of the trade offs  
N => Awesome Hotel After my flight was canceled AA put me up at this Hilton property  I am typically wary of airport hotels but this Hilton had a very good room product  The overall experience was just fine but the room was super comfortable relaxing well orated and appointed PRAISE the room was phenomenal  The bed was super comfortable they have this awesome black leather reclining chair that is very relaxing and the bathroom amenities are very nice CONS check in was somewhat slow even at midnight when I was checking in   there were  of us in line and I waited about  minutes before being checked in   not a huge deal but seems like an easy thing to fix  The bathroom was fairly small in size  ODD the bellhop and some fancy car driver were talking in the lobby and got me to spend  for his sedan car service to a terrible restaurant about  minutes away   because quotit was the only optionquot  Turns out not to be true and I was sort of upset by this and didnt want to call that driver to take me back after dinner   but there were no cabs available either  I walked into the Sheraton that was nearby to ask if they could call me a cab   instead they very graciously just took me back to the Hilton in their own shuttle   I gave the driver a  tip for his kindness  OVERALL excellent room and pretty good overall experience  I would recommend it if the price is right  
N => Hilton was a pleasant escape from the American Airlines Meltdown I was booked by an American Airlines Agent after my flight home was cancelled  The Hilton was convenient and very comfortable  I was especially greatful not to have to take a cab off the airport site when it became apparent that I would have to re book in person to get home the next day  This Hilton was as noce as any Ive stayed at recently and better than many  The only downside was the very mediocre restaurant Andiamo  My first dinner order of ribs was so overcooked and dried out it literally could not be cut however the waiter saw this and offered a replacement main course  The chef is uninspired at best  
N => Great for travelers not so much a family We booked this hotel because we got agreat deal through Priceline  Well it was a great deal until we learned when we arrived at the hotel that it was an extra     per day for parking depending if we wanted to use the Airport ramp or Valet  I swallowed that pill checked in amp got up to our room  The room was nice enough newer or fairly clean but it was  degrees  After an attempt to adjust the thermostat I called down the to desk  Apparently they were still on winter heat amp not on summer AC yet so our only option was to open a window on the th floor with a very mobile  year old dhter and no screens on the floor level window  At that point we knew we couldnt stay  Everyone was very polite amp we were refunded  Also not in walking distance to any restaurants unless you want to dine at the airport or have very expensive room service  
N => Very convenient for Business Meetings Very pleased with our experience with HILTON OHARE  We needed to bring our US Sales Force together for one day meeting and OHARE was easiest non stop from every major city in US  The meeting facilities were very well equipped properly staffed and things could not have gone better  There is even a shipping store in the lower level of the Hilton so we could ship out our binders to everyone to prevent travel overload  Would highly recommend for US business meetings 
N => Pleasantly Surprised Staying in a hotel connected to a major airport I had very low expectations  But I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Hilton and have no reservations recommending it to anyone The hotel is attached to the airport  The quickest way to access the hotel is by walking outside  However the airport signs direct you through an interior route that makes you think youve walked a mile to get there  NOT the hotels fault    try asking someone for the shortest route Check in was quick  I asked for a quotquietquot room and was given one where I never heard an airplane despite being next to the airport  The room was of adequate size with a large desk and comfortable recliner  There is a large TV not flat screen and a well stocked mini bar  Bed was very comfortable and wake up call was timely The bathroom was modern  The only negative was the shower curtain looked dated  Not a huge bathroom but adequate and well appointed Room service was prompt and the food was ent if not exceptional  Many choices on the menu and the server was very pleasant  Empty tray was cleared very quickly This hotel is obviously geared toward travelers who need to overnight in Chicago  However having stayed at a number of quotairport hotelsquot this one was much better than most  And you cant beat the location    a  minute walk to the United terminal  If you find yourself needing to overnight in Chicago and want a nice hotel with great convenience the Hilton is it  Not having to wait for a shuttle and having a modern comfortable room are major extras  
N => Enjoyable Stay I booked this hotel through Priceline and I got a real good rate of   per night  Overall I thought that the hotel was very clean quiet and comfortable  The hotel staff was not overly friendly but they were ok  The room itself was very clean and the bed was comfortable  Access to the hotel from the airport was very simple as there are a number of signs that show you how to get to the hotel inside the airport  The only problem that I had with the hotel is the parking situation  The hotel wanted to charge   per night which is ridiculous  We ided to park at the OHare economy parking lot instead for   per night and take the train right to the hotel which was a little inconvenient  
N => Very poor The desk gave me the key to someone elses room it was pm and on reflection i was lucky i didnt get shot   the room ocupants screamed I had a minor heart attack and then back to the desk to try again  
N => Dont even think of it if youre with little kidsinfants I am a mother and was travelling alone with my  small children  years old girl and  month old boy  We got stranded at OHare due to flight cancellations and had to spend the night  For the low price of  plus tax The front desk people could have been more friendly and helpful considering I was alone with  small kids  The hotel was busy but there was no need for them to be so snippy with the customers Considering that the OHare Hilton is the ONLY hotel attached to OquotHare one would think that the hotel would be somewhat used to people travelling with small children and infants  The gift shop had one VERY overpriced package of diapers and one very very overpriced thing of ready to drink infant formula  There was no baby food not a jar of Gerber to be found  I bought the diapers and formula  diapers and  oz of formula cost me    would have cost under  at Target  Got upstairs trying to figure out how to feed my starving baby and then BEGGED room service to make me an apple or vegetable puree for my infant  The concierge was unwilling to help me get baby food   i asked them to send a taxi to Walgreens to get me some baby food and they told me to take the taxi myself kinda hard with  exhausted kids and no carseats  After crying and literally begging room service they got me some applesauce for the low price of   They should really have something to offer mothers or fathers stuck there with kids  I also asked the front desk if they had a toothbrush and they told me that i had to buy one at the gitfshop  I told them that Id already been to their giftshop once waited for  minutes for the clerk to return from her quotbreak she had a quotback in  minutesquot sign taped to the door found the formula and diapers forgot about not having a toothbrush then got upstairs to my room put my kids to bed and realized I had no toothbrush  I asked the front desk to please make an exception for an exhausted single mom with  sleeping kids you cannot leave the room while your kids are asleep and they told me that i was out of luck  Gift shop or dirty teeth  They brought me a pack n play for my baby to sleep in but the blanket was soiled  Phoned and they delivered a quotcleanquot blanket I would encourage the OHare Hilton to do the right thing and begin stocking baby food andor be more open to helping people who are stranded at Oquothare without luggage and without items for their children The room was clean the beds comfy and the bathroom tiny  Quite quiet  
N => Convenient but nothing special It was okay I guess  I cant complain too much since I only paid  thanks to Continental Airlines after I got fogged in for a night  I chose this hotel because I had a am flight and didnt want a hassle in the morning  For that purpose the hotel is good You cant get more convenient at this airport  Now that my stay there is over would I stay there again under similar circumstances stranded due to flight cancellations if I had to pay   Probably not but I guess everyone has to make their own call on how much theyll pay to be just a quick walk away from their flight  I wouldnt because I found this hotel to be third rate  I dont mind a stay at second or third rate hotel or even someting like a Red Roof Inn so long as Im being charged accordingly  This hotel wants to take advantage of you and your wallet and your stranded at the airport situation every chance they get  For example I stupidly threw my disposable razor away at a previous hotel before I departed for OHare and found Id have to pay about  bucks to get one crappy disposable razor at this hotel had to purchase a bathroom kit from the mini bar  Waitll you see the prices for candy bars and potato chips The room was small and nothing special  Think of your typical night hotel and thats about what you get  IOW if youre payting   bucks plus all the additional charges youll feel stupid  Two light bulbs were out and the lights that worked werent very bright  I know I couldve called from replacement bulbs but judging by the  minutes I was on hold for room service and the hour and  minute wait for the sandwich I didnt bother  The grilled chicken sandwich was pretty good though  I normally wouldnt complain about delays in room service  Theres just shy of  rooms they have to deal with  But the person who delivered the food vented to me without my prompting about people in other rooms getting frustrated by the slow service  He said they were having trouble because there were a zillion flights cancelled and the entire hotel was filled  The thing is a main purpose of this hotels purpose is to be there for the victims of when zillions of flight cancellations hit OHare  Youd think theyd have their act together a bit better since this is a regular occurance  The TV was annoying because each channel seemed to be at a different volume to an extreme degree  The showerhead was pathetic  They have ice machines designed in a way that makes it quite a task to hold your ice bag under it and still be able to push the button to get the ice  When I went to the front desk during the night to get help on a few things I found that their late night staff are zombies  Talking to one particular woman manning the desk was like talking to a wall  It took her five minutes to figure out that I was indeed staying in the room I was staying in that I had checked in with an American Express card and she could indeed give me a mini bar key  She also didnt seem aware that postcard stamps are not  cents so rather than trying to deal with her confusion I let her put a  stamp on the postcard   whatever  Oh and the carpeting throughout the hotel is truly vile though I guess it serves the purpose of helping you know when you are in Hilton territory as opposed to the rest of the airport  On the good side I did get a good few hours of sleep the wake up call was on the minute the pillows comfy and there was absolutely no noise from outside or other rooms  I also liked the view of the airport from the window and how easy it was to get back to my room via the L train in the middle of rush hour from a quick afternoon shoppinglunch trip in downtwon Chicago  I hope I dont sound like too much of a complainer  I only say all these things in order to stress that theyre charging a lot for third rate roomsservice  
N => Nice place Average stay  Even though nothing was bad nothing really set it out from the crowd either  
N => Convenient stay Due to an early morning departure and late night arrival we spent a night here both before and after vacation  The rates seemed reasonable so we took the commuter bus from Milwaukee which was very convenient the quotbus terminalquot is right across the street and allowed us to avoid the hassle of constuction on I   Check in was quick and painless  It wasnt busy either time so we used the front desk  One clerk was quite indifferent while the other was more friendly and outgoing though both were very efficient  The room was smaller than I expected but suited our needs perfectly  It was clean and quiet  I was a little too tired both nights to give an unbiased assessment of the beds but I did sleep well both nights  We had evening snacks to hold us over at the sports bar  The waitress warned us about the small portion sizes and she was right but it was probably what I should normally have anyway  We enjoyed a very good breakfast at the restaurant not the buffet which like everything else here was pricey but thats expected  Given this experience Id use this hotel again in a similar situation  The convenience of being connected to the terminal is just too good to pass up  
N => Fine by Me I stayed here twice during stop overs in and out of Chicago and i found the hotel to be perfectly adequate  Yes the rooms are quite small but then so are most airport hotels  The beds were very comfy and the room was nice an quiet  The bath rooms could have done with a stening up but that was it really  Its a shame that they dont have an Exec Lounge like most Hilton airport hotels as this would have made the stay even better although the sports bar was good a nice atmosphere friendly bar staff and good food  I will stay there again the only negative aspect was the price increase from  on the saturday i stayed to  for the same room type just because it was mid week  But hey you get more Hilton base points to maintain that all important Diamond card  
N => Great ption if you dont want to pay downtown Chicago prices Sorry for the late review           My husband and I stayed in this hotel for a weekend in ust   at the last minute we had gotten tickets to a Cubs game and to Second CIty  When I checked online for hotel reservations most of the hotels downtown were booked since there was a large concert that weekend  This actually ended up working out in our favor   instead of paying night for a room downtown we paid night for a room at this hotel  We were satisfied   we were able to easily access everything Chicago has to offer since the train to downtown was directly downstairs from the hotel  In addition it made a late night flight into Chicago not that big of a deal since the hotel is a  minute walk from the gates Main areas were nice as were hallways  The elevator was super slow be some were not running  The room was adequate   it was clean and my only complaint is not the noise from the airport but rather from the rooms air conditioner  Im usually a deep sleeper and it kept me up all night  Furniture and or were nice Check in was fast and easy   we arrived late on a Friday night and there werent too many people around  The concierge was friendly and helpful When we return to Chicago we will probably stay on the Magnificent Mile however this hotel suited our last minute needs just fine and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be close to the airport or doesnt want to pay the steep prices of staying downtown  
N => Thankfully United Airlines Was Paying I try to stay at Hiltons whenever possible as Im Gold with them approaching Diamond status   Was delighted when United put me up there after one of the bad T storms this summer shut down the airport  Was also delighted that they found me a room so close to ORD without having to take a cab somewhere   Once I got there my impression was that the hotel was BARELY up to Hilton standards  It wasnt a bad property by any means but nothing special except extortionist prices for everything  The  meal voucher from United got me an appetizer or would have paid about  of my main entree  I had no toiletries checked baggage on my way home from a  week trip and dropped a half a houayment for deodorant contact lens solution and toothpastetoothbrush My room was really nothing special kind of small I thought considering we werent in downtown Chicago  Comfy bed but I didnt have a plasma TV like others mentioned below  Normally Id get a preferred room but I was told I was getting one of the last  rooms left in the hotel  So Ill cut them some slack considering I didnt get the pick of the litter of rooms If it was coming out of my or my companys pocket Id surely select another nearby Hilton property and cab ride it and save probably  a night  
N => Only hotel AT the airport We booked this hotel as we were driving from Wisconsin to Chicago to catch a flight to NY at the end of our road trip visit to the East Coast and Midwest USA We had an early flight so we wanted to stay near the airport and this hotel is the only one which appears to be in the grounds of the airport  It is in fact connected to one of the terminals by an underground walkway which was handy for me as I was dropping off a rental car and then cht the shuttle back to the airport to get back to the hotel As for the hotel   it is an airport Hilton  What more can you say Check was very easy bell staff were efficient and personable the rooms were Hilton rooms   not real big but OK  We had connecting rooms which was something of rarity on this trip despite our request at every hotel we stayed  In fact it was the only time out of seven hotel stays that they managed it We ate at the restaurant Andiamo and it was nice enough  Check out was simple and the shuttle to the airport was efficient   it still takes about   minutes to get to the terminal by shuttle because of the looping road system so depending on the traffic going into the airport some of the nearby hotels  offer cheaper alternatives without being in the airport grounds and without a significant difference in shuttle time  All in all we were happy with this as a choice of hotel   it did what it claimed to do and for this we were grateful 
N => Overcharged Our flight was delayed by  hours and we missed our connecting flight so we had to catch the next one at AM the next morning  As a result of the delay the airport was willing to give us a Motel  about  miles away for   Id have to say OHare probably has the worst service  As a result we walked into the Hilton  At the desk the lady gave us a rate of  plus tax in other words over  We asked if there was anything cheaper and she said quotNopequot   was probably the club level but we were only staying for be  hours We had never paid for any hotel quite that expensive NOT EVEN FOR A RITZ CARLTON We had no choice  Its either that or the Motel  When we got to the room we found that it was definitely not the club level room  There was nothing wrong with it  It had a nice reation  The bathrooms were clean  The beds were not uncomfortable  However at  a night Internet was not free  Things in the Mini Bar were not free  Breakfast was not included  This was outrageous The Atlanta Hilton Airport hotel was much nicer and it would cost only  Overall the hotel itself was not a problem but DEFINITELY NOT  
N => Very Expensive Port in a Storm I was stuck overnight in Chicago when my flight home was cancelled due to bad weather and booked the OHare Hilton for its convenience and availability  Fortunately my company paid the cost  it was  including taxes and one day of Internet access  A late spring snowstorm had made all accomodations expensive  Nice typical room but I wasted considerable time getting on line because I believed the sign in my room telling me Wi Fi was not available but Ethernet was  I couldnt find the Ethernet connection  I called the hotel operator who patched me in to Tech Support  You guessed it  the room had no Ethernet but did have Wi Fi  The sign lied  They really ought to replace it I considered room service but prices were crazy so I joined fellow ooned colleagues in the Sports Bar  still overpriced but ent food  As a Gold HHonors member I got a free continental breakfast buffet  full buffet including omelets would have been only  additional The pool was a generous size for a city hotel and I had it all to myself  fitness center was well equipped with a particularly large selection of weights Kiosk check in and the ability to print boarding passes before you leave the hotel were nice conveniences A nice place to hide out for the night but Im glad to be heading home 
N => Another Lemons to Lemonade Story On    we were delayed in Chicago for  nights as we travelled from Manchester UK to Denver due to snow closing Denver Airport  American Airlines gave us details of a distressed passenger rate at another hotel  However after waiting hr mins   despite a kind lady at the information desk phoning the hotel for us twice   the shuttle bus had still not arrived  So we returned to the airport and picked up the Hilton phone The reservation lady was very helpful to this tired and stressed Englishwoman who could barely hear her because of the background noise  She went out of her way to see if we were eligible for any reduction in the rate and searched the system to find my Hilton Honors details   until she mentioned it Id completely forgotten I was a member  She apologised for the high rate for that night but obviously it was due to the demand caused by the delays  She was however able to reduce the rate considerably for the next  nights We cht the airport train to the hotel and were able to check in quickly at the arate HHonors desk  The main registration had a long long queue   presumably lots of delayed people trying to get a room  Our room was on the th floor and was very comfortable and well appointed  It had an excellent view of the runways but no noise from it I love to watch an airport at work although my husband isnt bothered because he works at one  We ate in the sports bar that evening and had breakfast in the main restaurant the following morning both of which were very good We travelled into downtown Chicago by train on both days  The station is easily accessible from the hotel without having to go outside  A  day visitor pass which covers all trains and buses including out to OHare cost   each which we thought was excellent value Having transited Chicago on numerous occasions we had often said we should stop over and visit the city some time  The Hilton provided us with a comfortable and safe haven for this enforced visit allowing us to turn an inconvenient delay into an enjoyable part of our vacation  Whilst somewhat expensive it was worth every penny  
N => Run dont walk and no need to drive to the hilton As soon as you find out youre stuck in Chicago get here as quick as you can  The rooms are small but new and the bar is a great place to get a quick bite to eat  I LOVE staying here when I have to  Its a great place to swap travel horror stories over a few beers and you can catch the first flight out without getting up too early  
N => Convenient location poor service The location for this hotel cannot be beat  It is a total oasis for any stranded traveller at Ohare  The rooms are nice and quiet  Plenty of amenities  However the service leaves much to be desired  My remote control was malfunctioning and it took  calls and  minutes to get anyone to look at the TV  then when maintenance realized that the tv was malfunctioning not the remote no one offered to move me to another room but rather offered to fix the TV  at midnight  not a great option  front desk was not helpful either  in sumy great location poor service  
N => Hated this Hilton The beds were uncomfortable  There was no place to get breakfast nearby  since no one can go to the airport without being a ticketed passenger since    The indoor pool was rather small  The rooms were small  The only plus was that it was attached to the airport where you could easily hop on the subway  I would not want to stay at this property again  
N => Convenient to Airport  Comfortable Room We stayed here after a long flight and United lost our baggage  it was convenient  right on site at OHare  you can even walk The beds were comfortable and the room was exceptionally clean Check in was a little long but overall we were satisfied 
N => ent This was a ent hotel and I would stay here again  I would not however come here for an anniversary weekend or anything like that  This hotel is great if you have a conference at the hotel or want to stay in close proximity to the airport  The rooms were clean and I actually liked the view of the runway and sometimes found myself just watching airplanes take off and land  Check in was not easy as I tried to check in early   and they had been notified of that  When I first arrived I asked the young woman behind the counter if I could check in early  She then proceeded to explain that check in hadn t started yet etc  I stopped her and said I obviously understood that as I just said I wanted to check in  early  and that the person who had arranged my accommodations had asked about it and was told that it was a possibility  Well this young woman told me to come back   like     hours later  She made no proactive attempt to help me   she didn t even check to see if a room was ready  So I suggested that she take down my cell phone number and perhaps think about checking and then calling me if something came available  In the meantime I went to the restaurant Andiamo which is ent and then came back an hour later  A very helpful woman named Latifah was there this time and as soon as I said Can I check in early  she checked found a room and handed me a key  Anyway this type of service is not surprising at a chain  Also the restaurant as I said was ent  They weren t good with details   each time I ate at Andiamo I spotted small irritants   like dirty silverware crumbs on the table they sat me at dirty cups straws in my drinks that were generously orated with lint and other unknown particles etc  So I d have to ask for clean silverware I like my forks without caked on dishwasher baked food thank you very much  Overall my stay was as to be expected  Would stay there again if necessary but this would not be the place to go for a  special  weekend  
N => Convenient  We had to adjust our reservation by  day and did so without hassle  When we finally arrived we were able to check in early am and go straight to our room  The clerk was kind enough to warn us of possible construction noise in the East Wing early during the weekday but we never heard anything and we were up early anyway to catch a flight Our room seemed average  The  double beds seemed smaller than the usual size beds I see in other smaller hotels  My husbands feet hung over the end and hes only  foot  in   No microwave or fridge but we had a mini bar though it was incredibly over priced  The bathroom sink stopper didnt work so we had to call maintenance  The bathroom door was peeling from the bottom and the shower leaked onto the floor in spite of adjusting the curtain several times  The crib we requested wasnt in the room yet so I made another request just in case they forgot but I figured since we checked in early they  not have had a chance to get a crib to the room yet  We had a small coffee pot  Check out was easy enough  They took another form of payment without hassle  We never used the mini bar so no extra charges or scams on that  I wanted to have breakfast even a buffet would have been nice but the only restaurant I saw looked very expensive their idea of a buffet was in the hall Overall though the staff was friendly my sink issue and crib was fixed right away the hotel is convenient to the airport  I will stay there again mainly for the convenience  
N => ent hotel but not as good as Doubletree My husband and I got this hotel through priceline for our anniversary weekend  When I bid I was really hoping for the Doubletree in the same area but ended up at the Hilton OHare  Overall this was a ent hotel  The only mention of Priceline was to say that it was already paid for through them so that was ok  The check in was a little crazy  They had about  people waiting to check in and only one person helping us and she was going very slow Then we were told we could use a kiosk to check in if we had a confirmation number    we had one so we tried that  No luck  No one was able to get the kiosk to work for check in  So we all got back in line and waited  Eventually we were helped by the clerk at the quotUnited Airlines Employee Check Inquot area  He was very nice and we were on our way  We had asked for a non smoking room and we were given a non smoking king bed on the th floor which is supposedly a floor usually reserved for HHonors guests  The room was neat and clean but very small  The bed however was very very comfortable Very similar to the ones at Doubletree  The bathroom was beyond tiny but very functional Ok so far my review seems to merit more than the  stars I am giving    the biggest problem in this hotel was the housekeeping The first day they cleaned our room we returned to a bathroom that was devoid of most of the supplies  The kleenex had run out and was not replaced they did not replace about half of the towels and there was no new soap or shampooconditioner even though the originals had been used up It was ridiculous  But it was late we were tired so we let it go  The next day    the same thing This time we called the front desk and after a short wait they brought the stuff up  Another annoying thing is that you have to completely rely on the very expensive restaurants in the hotel for food  We tried to go to the airport one time    which is actually connected    but they had only fast food in most areas  Thankfully we mostly ate downtown while seeing the sites The restaurant Andiamo has great Italian food for dinner though  But we were not at all impressed with breakfast Overall we would stay here again but we would prefer the Doubletree in Rosemont 
N => Left us holding our bags Not a good start to our stay when the Hilton shuttle bus left us standing outside the airport in the heat for  minutes We had to call from the airport  times before someone finally came out to pick us up  We stood there watching the Sheraton shuttle bus go by THREE rotations during our wait  When the driver finally arrived he was friendly but also mentioned that it was pretty common for guests to be left for at least  minutes  Considering they are the only hotel on airport grounds this is inexcusableWhen we finally arrived at the front desk I told the clerk about our long wait and she seemed so unconcerned and never even hinted at an apology We asked this same clerk for directions to our AA departure flight the next morning and she said to just cross the street to the right of the hotel  Turns out this was in the airport parking garage We found out later that we had to take another Hilton shuttle for quite a distance around the airport The room was nice and the bedding comfortable but the bathroom was well below what we expected from a Hilton  We figured after a long international flight it would be nice to take a dip in the hotels pool  We figured wrong after finding out the charge was   EACH for a swim We should have guessed after seeing the sign in our room saying quotwelcome your first pot of coffee is on us if you require additional coffee there will be a charge of   per potquot If you like being nickled and dimed to death along with poor service after spending a large amount on a room this is the place for you 
N => Good airport accommodations Very convenient if you want to stay by airport  Rooms standard Hilton dependable quality and cleanliness  Also convenient to L train  Andiamos very nice for dinner breakfast kids menu  Did not try poolhealth club as there was an extra fee involved  
N => convenient location but not very pleasant stay We stayed at the hotel for one night since my husband and dhter were flying out of Ohare early in the morning  When making reservation called hotel directly and went through internet travel sites to get a rate  Lowest rate available was  a night  After reading a review of somebody that had gone through Hotwire I gave it a try and was able to get a rate of   a night  Arrived at hotel about PM with two children  Hotel staff was friendly but not overly helpful  As soon as we got off the elevator on our rooms floor we were greeted with halls full of television sets all over the place  I guess they have been remodeling but the first impression was not a positive one  Room itself was OK but nothing fancy and pretty small  The room felt like a sauna as we came in and this did not improve at all even after setting thermostat to the lowest setting possible  I was not able to sleep at all with the heat kept needing to take drinks of water and put wet towels on my head  Not an exageration at all  The girls woke up with their faces red from the heat  Very very uncomfortable to say the least  The rest of the hotel is OK we used the pool and fitness center which is pretty good but you have to pay extra to use About  per family  We ordered desserts at the restaurant and those were very good  We wasted a lot of time trying to check out  The in room service did not add up fitness center charges etc   There was only one attendant checking people out and we had to wait almost half an hour to finish our transaction  My husband and dhter walked over to the airport to check in and came back and I was still in line to check out Other than having the most convenient location for early morning flights out of Ohare I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Horrendous rip off  
N => Not worth the money  
N => Rip Off  
N => goed airport hotel  
N => It is just ok    We were in town for a wedding and had two rooms booked one for this hotel and the other for Residence Inn for a much cheaper rate  See my review for Residence Inn We arrived early as our flight landed at Midway at am and I had already called about an early check in  When we arrived they indicated that they were at   capacity  They did not have a non smoking king room sbut had two queen non smoking available for the same rate so we took it The room was nothing to write home about  The bed was not comfortable at all but the pillows were nice  The remote was old and barely worked most of the time which annoyed me to no end  Breakfast was not complimentary and just to get pastries and yogurt it was    If you wanted meant that was going to cost you an additional    I called one of the restaurants in the book from the hotel and ordered myself breakfast which came up to    They informed me that the menu has not been updated and the meal that was priced at   was now    I ided to cancel my order  
N => Wouldnt stay again My brother was getting ried in Chicago  I was going to book the hotel for the weekend but we ided to stay one night and Im glad we did  Based on some of the other reviews some of the rooms must be updated with newer beds  Our beds were so uncomfortable that my husband and I didnt sleep all night and got up with sore backs and necks  The tub in the bathroom wouldnt drain  I ended up not taking a shower in the morning because I didnt want to stand in inches of water  The room had a nice flat screen TV but seemed a little smaller then the average room  We wouldnt stay again even though Im a Hilton honors member    I would stay some where else  
N => A nice cheap hotel The hotel was a great place to stay  It is close to many attractions  The staff was helpful in referring us to nearby restaurants  My only complaint would be that the toilet paper is too far away from the toilet  You almost have to get off of the seat in order to reach it  The housekeeping staff was great in locating my clothing that I had inadvertently left behind  They are in the process of shipping it to me  I would definitely stay here again 
N => It was magnificent We arrived early to Chicago hoping to leave the luggage in the hotel    but the room was already available even at amThe location couldnt be better and the service was amazing  
N => Do not stay here under any circumstances Im writing this review to warn fellow travelers not to stay here  Because the wonderful Homewood Suites next door was booked up we were wound up staying here  I expected this hotel to be similar to the Homewood Suites  Instead it was a complete disappointment  Sure the staff was very helpful and friendly and the rooms were very clean  However ultimately when you pay for a hotel room youre paying for a place to sleep for the night  The Hilton Garden Inn is a total complete and utter failure in this regard  The walls have absolutely no soundproofing at all  You can here your neighbors TV conversations everything  One night I got shaken awake by my neighbor who happened to like to blast his TV at  a m  And mind you all rooms are like this  I kept changing rooms and they all have the same walls which seem to be made out of a thin piece of drywall or possibly even cardboard  No matter which room youre in youll be able to here TVs and conversations from the rooms adjacent to you  This place also serves no breakfast unless youre willing to pay a rediculous amount of money for cornflakes and a bagel  Youre better off staying in a cheap motel  Cheap motels that Ive stayed at had better services and better soundproofing than this Hilton Garden Inn  If youre just looking for a nice quiet place to sleep do not stay at this hotel  For what you get out of it it is totally overpriced and generally not a pleasant place to be  
N => great location low on staff location was great resterant on sight was good indoor pool was clean warm enough to enjoy whirl pool great as well great location few steps from the red line metro  Had a few issues with lack of staff  Had no towels called front desk took about  hours to get towels  next day no one cleaned room at all  called front desk about pm someone came about pm to clean didnt get usa today either but other rooms did  Same deal the next day as well did come to clean the third day       no conceirge on hand tried to wait on line to ask desk staff questions they were busy and not very accomodating  Rooms were large and nice location was great close to everything but dont expect service any time soon very short on staff and it was obvious  
N => Great location Pretty much had nothing much to complain about the hotel  Except when we checked in the staff who checked us in did not smile or greet us and continue talking to other staff while serving us  With the brand name I expect polite and caring staff but we did not get it here  However theres another staff later whos really attentive so I guess we just got unlucky being served by that one lady during our check in time  Room was clean comfortable with free wireless internet and spacious bathroom  Its virtually close to everywhere Magnificent mile Millenium Park Navy Pier etc  Bear in mind that you have to pay extra for parking  For valet its  and self park is   Overall Im satisfied and recommend this to anyone  
N => The staff went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful My family and I were traveling to Frankfurt Germany and wanted a nonstop flight  Because we used to live in Chicago we ided to spend a night in Chicago before flying to Germany since we could get a nonstop flight from Chicago We Pricelined this hotel and got two rooms for each  We planned for my husband to stay in one room with one of our children while I stayed in the other room with the other child our children are  and   We inquired about adjoining rooms however and found that we were able to get adjoining rooms which made life a lot easier  Since our flight to Frankfurt the next day was late in the evening we asked to arrange a late checkout  They were so helpful that they allowed us to stay until  p m  so that my kids could take naps When we checked out we asked Kristy at the front desk if there was any way she could arrange adjoining rooms for us again on our way back and she did just that This was potentially a stressful trip for us but it was made so much more pleasant just by the small things that the folks at HGI were willing to do for us  Oh and the rooms were exceptionally comfortable and well appointed 
N => Nice hotel in a great location We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn e  th   This was our second stay at this location  The first stay was great as well and we really liked the great location just off Michigan Avenue  This hotel is also just off the EL redline at the Grand Avenue stop  There are a lot of dining and drinking options within walking distance too Check in went very quickly no lines  The room was clean and comfortable  Good beds not too hard not too soft they had some sort of adjustable feature but not like sleep number beds it has a knob on the side so Im not sure how it really worked  We were on the th floor and did not have much of a view but that was ok with us  We were not in the room much  The rooms are good sized for Chicago also  Some hotel rooms can be small there  I recommend this hotel if you plan to use public transit  It is fast and easy to use in Chicago  We took the train to Wrigley Field for a baseball game on  days and also to the Sears Tower and Macy s  We also visited the Frontera Fresco at Macys on State Street th floor and even saw Rick Bayless stop in to check on his quick service restaurant That was unexpected Ive seen him at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo before at night but I was shocked to see him here We also dined at Shaws Crab House which was very good though we ate in the Oyster Bar not the main dining room which is a bit louder atmosphere but the same food  We also found a great mini golf course in Grant Park which was very fun called The Green at Grant Park  You can get a beer before during or after you play mini golf  We enjoyed listening to the Blues Fest acts across the street while we golfed  Overall we had a great second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago and Id stay here again  
N => Sirens All Night Long I had stayed here previously without incident  My last stay will definitely be my last stay  I was awoken every half hour or so by sirens  Needless to say I did not get much sleep  Other than that small problem the hotel and room itself was nice  
N => Be prepared to pay LOTS We stayed at this hilton on part of a package deal Its a nice hotel clean  bathrooms in our room but The extras you have to pay are far too high  Parking  per day   for a bottle of water  for internet The pool was closed for maintanance so asked if we could have a reduction on parking  We were just lhed at 
N => Mixed up beginning happy ending  We had an issue with making a phone reservation and not receving an email confirmation  When I ided to call to confirm our reservation the afternoon of the night we were scheduled to arrive I was told there was no reservation under my name  Come to find out an error had somehow been made and we were booked at a different Hilton  We were able to come to a compromise however  This hotel is very conveniently located downtown within walking distance of many shops restaurants    Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating  Poolhottub were ent although quite small  This was a family vacation for us and we were overall impressed with the hotel   TIP  Park your own car for much cheaper    just park near an elevator in the parking ramp    its the same place for valet parking 
N => This place sucks Dont stay here the youre better off going to the adjacent hotels for a better hotel stay and are more accommodating than the Hilton  The iott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night  Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night  You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force  We were literally in the hotel for  minutes before we were told we were being kicked out  We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out  We had  police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came  Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything  Ive already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead we go to the riott now  
N => Prepaid Suite Reservations But No Room At This Inn Oh my I was so disappointed with my recent trip to Chicago  My sister dhter and I had tickets to the Oprah Show  I made reservations for us to have a suite at the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago DowntownMagnificent Mile  I prepaid the reservation as I wanted to guarantee that we would have our suite  We live in Cincinnati and instead of flying we ided to make the five hour trip by driving  I wanted to have a suite so we could have a better place to unwind  We arrived at the hotel and I gave the valet our car and he parked it  We went inside to check in  We were greeted promptly and given our room keys  Off we went to see our little suite Imagine my surprise when we opened the door to the suite and we walked into a tiny room with two queen beds which consumed the room  I immediately called the front desk to tell them a mistake had been made  A bad sign   it took me about five minutes to speak to someone at the front desk  The gentleman at the front desk John told me that I didnt have a suite reservation  I then told him I had written confirmation and that I had prepaid   which the check in person had already noted that I had prepaid my room  quotJohnquot said that the room that I was in was just as good as a suite and I should be happy there  WHAT I told him I was not happy as we had three adults and I had advised that three adults were staying there in my online reservation request and then I learned the truth  All of the suites were taken  I told John that I wanted him to find me another suite in another hotel  John said o k  and about ten minutes later I called back downstairs and he told me that he had miraculously been able to get a room at the Embassy Suites and we were so lucky So the three of us head downstairs to be taken to the Embassy Suites  This jerk is at the front desk when we go downstairs and he is trying to ignore us  The young man who checked us in asked us quotIs there a problem with your roomquot And I told him quotYes we dont have a room as my suite has evidently been given away even though I prepaid for the suite quot That young man was apologetic and he asked who we had spoken to  Then the rude guy John comes over and says quotGo over to the Embassy Suites turn right and it is about a block down quot Did I mention it was pouring rain So we walk through the rain and go check in at the Embassy Suites  They request a credit card so I give them my Amex which they promptly charge the quotsuite quot The next day when we check out we have to traipse back over to the Hilton from the Embassy with our luggage in tow to re claim our car from valet parking  Nice huh I have to go back inside the Hilton so that they can do a arate charge for the valet parking but I cant seem to get anyone to issue me a credit for the suite that I had prepaid for  I called the Hilton tonight and I talked to someone who told me to leave a vm for the manager  I have now left her a vm and I am awaiting a phone call to see what remedy is available for me  I am so disgusted by this hotels treatment of their guests  UnbelievableWe did eat at two terrific restaurants and I will review them arately  They were Webers Grill and Shaws RestaurantSeafood  Yummy 
N => main downtown Amazing deal  a nyt  worth every bit of it  
N => Front desk had an attitude over the phone and hung up on me I was running a little late checking out so I called the front desk to ask for  minutes more to check out  The woman at the front desk said she had to pull up my reservation first  Then she asked me how i was going to pay for the valet parking which I never had in the first place  After explaining to her that I self parked with an attitude she told me that the hotel was fully booked and not to take any longer than  mins  As if everyone is really rushing to Chicago right now for some reason Anyways as I was saying quotthank youquot just to be polite she hung up on me  I stayed there  days and after the first night the room wasnt cleaned until late afternoon  Also the first day we found old drinks in the refrigerator that had already expired  The room directory is outdated and not specific  
N => A Great Hotel I just got back from a dental convention in Chicago and ided to stay at this Hilton Garden Inn  Let me start by saying this hotel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown close to the red line train shopping and numerous great places to eat  The check in was polite and fast  I got up to my room and was surprised how clean and modern the room was  Flat screen T V  king size foam bed comfortable enough for me but if you like a bed that is on the firm side you  not like this one  The room also had a fridge and microwave which was nice The bathroom was spotless There were two concerns though one was the common halls had an echo and some guests dont seem to think of others at one o clock in the morning yelling slamming doors etc  Second the ACHEATING UNIT kept coming on for  or  seconds at a time all through the night Annoying And very loud This was after I switched it off After the first night I went down to the front desk to notify them of this problem and they sent somebody up to the roomI guess while I was out to try to fix this but the second and last night I stayed the same problem happened again  The front desk staff did ask me if the problem was fixed but after I said quotNoquot she didnt seem to care to much  I would recommend this hotel if your a quotdeep sleeper quot 
N => Great place to stay After a few bad choice hotels in the downtown Chicago area   I finally found one I would return toI stayed here on business   for a Cubs game  We booked  rooms    for myself    for a co worker    for a customer Everyone was very pleased  It was super convenient to everything  Even the subway was right downstairs which normally we take a cab to Wriglyville   however it was pm on a tuesday and we knew it would take extra long in traffic   highly reccommended The restaurantbar downstairs is very nice   everyone was very friendly  However it does close fairly early  Breakfast was included for our HHonors and served at the same restaurant   a lot to choose from The rooms were big clean and modernly orated  A Will be back 
N => very pleasant stay even though L stop was closed We called ahead to alert the hotel of our late check in due to flight troubles and we had no problems when we checked in around midnight the room we had requested was ready for us The room was clean included a mini fridge microwave computer desk etc  The bathroom was stocked with Neutrogena toiletries We heard minimal traffic from our th floor room  We enjoyed the pantry and Starbucks found in the lobby The front desk staff were curtious and quick with a map when we asked for directions  There were no problems checking our luggage at the front desk for a few hours after we had checked out We did not have time to eat at the Weber Grill restaurant found within the hotel but we heard it was great One downfall outside of the hotels control    We chose the hotel for its close proximity to a red line L stop but found that stop closed upon arrival  The red line next stop was about   blocks walking distance  If youre choosing the hotel based on its proximity to the L call ahead to check the status of the stop   we were told the stop has been closed often on weekends for repair Overall a very pleasant stay  
N => Just what we wanted We were in Chicago for  nights just to sightsee and we wanted to stay somewhere centrally located but less than night  This hotel was perfect  Two blocks north of the river two blocks west of the Magnificent Mile with a subway stop right at the corner The room was very clean plenty big lots of towels  The mattresses are air filled with a control on each side   we played with them but couldnt tell the difference in settings  They were comfortable   we really couldnt tell that they werent regular mattresses Even though we were on the th floor there was a lot of street noise   but we live in the country so we probably notice it more than most The front desk staff was efficient and friendly the valets were very nice and they have a small area next to the front desk where you can purchase snacks and such  hoursday I would definitely stay there again  
N => Good Value I spent five nights at the Hilton Garden having read the reviews on tripadivsor  My room was clean quiet with a comfortable bed   all at a really good rate  However this is not a high service hotel which is just fine based on the rate and convenient location  My biggest complaint was the total absence of door help when I arrived from a very long  hour flights with  bags I had to navigate through two door with no help  There were  front desk people watching me a  year old woman struggling with this process but no help came to my aid  However my check in clerk did thoughtfully put me in a higher floor room so it would be quiet  The room they were going to put me in was on the st floor where I could enjoy the roadwork being done right outside  Housekeeping was a little goofy  I never had the same towel count twice but it was just me so it was not a problem  The creamers they leave for your coffee were also often not left but the front desk always sent up some when I called My room was quiet as long as no one was in the hall making noise  There was a half inch space between the door and threshold to my room so hall noise came right in  A family group staying in multiple rooms around me were really loud but I could not hear them once they got into their rooms I was most pleased with the comfortable bed and having a frig with microwave  Overall a good value for the rate  But if they raised the rate I would choose a higher service hotel as a single travelers  
N => Highly recommend it I stayed at this hotel alone for one night and was not disappointed  I chose the hotel based on the good rate I found rather than location which was not a factor for me  My room  was very clean and aesthetically pleasant  The bathroom was clean with Neutrogena products provided  There was a microwave and small fridge  The bed was wonderful very fluffy pillows  I did not want to crawl out after a great nights sleep  I did take note of how quiet it was  Im used to hearing people in the hallways or next door regardless of the type of hotel I stay in but this was not the case here I would stay here again  
N => Poor Customer Service from Maid to Manager Not a place to stay for the customer service or the price  I hope this keeps at least one person or more from staying here  Maid service will knock on your door at  regardless of Do not distrub sign  I stay mostly at Hilton properties Hilton Honors Gold Member and this has been the worst  I called the front desk to have the maid comeback and she continued to try to get into the room until I opened the door and said go away  When I checked out they were no apologies or resolution  I was told that they were busy and wanted to have the room ready for the next guest  Checkout time was  and I was not able to check into the room until after pm when I arrived  days earlier  It was a total lack of respect that was undeserved  Hotel Management was no help and did not speak very good english  They would not return calls and I registered a complaint with the Honors line  Even the Hampton Inn has a policy of   satisfaction  This does not extend to the Hilton Garden  I work for a major Vendor and attend the RSNA every year  I will not stay there again and have instructed my travel agent who books room in e for this conference not to place anyone there if at all possible  Gold Hilton Honors Member  
N => Fine  not perfect This hotel is in a great location just off the magnificant mile  Its a garden inn  not the ritz  The room was clean and adequate but not large and luxurious  We had a few minor problems with housekeeping but they were responsive and took care of it immediately and the cooling unit  hard to maintain a steady temperature  but nothing serious or we would have rated it lower  The staff was friendly  We would happily stay there again but also would consider other places  
N => Noisy room This hotel was in a great location but staff were very impersonal  While we were checking in the clerk kept answering the phone The room was fairly spacious but the AC was very noisy  We turned it off to discover we could hear other rooms aircon  All we wanted was a quiet room  I would not stay at this hotel again  
N => Great experience My husband and I had go to Chicago on somewhat short notice  to take care of a relatives estate  Since it was going to be a stressful trip I didnt want to have to worry about the quality of the hotel  I found a reasonable price on Travelocity and booked our stay and we werent disappointed  We ended up extending our stay and were able to get an even better rate from the front desk than on the Hilton website We didnt rent a car and were able to get around easily the metro stop is literally outside the hotel as mentioned in another review  Having a small fridge and a microwave in the room allowed us to keep our food costs down  Theres a JewelOsco a block away and a Trader Joes about two or three blocks away  Plenty of good restaurants in the area too  The housekeeping staff took good care of our room and were friendly when we wanted to sleep in  
N => Too Good to be True Another great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  This was our rd time staying here in two years  We had adjoining rooms with my Mother Wife and three kids  We paid   a nite  This rate was through travelzoo  The hotel is in a excellent location  The staff are the friendliest people  I have to say that about everyone we had contact with  You will find that people in Chicago in general are friendlymust be a midwest thing  We also will be returning in ch  
N => Good Stay We had a nice  night stay at this hotel for a mini vacation during the last week of ust  The location was convenient and we walked to many things  The room was fairly spacious clean everything was in good shape and we had an ok view  It was fairly well equipped with a refrigerator microwave coffee maker iron internet service etc  One thing I forgot to check for when booking was an in room safe which they did not have  They did have safe deposit boxes at the front desk and that worked fine for us  We requested a high floor and they followed through by putting us on the top floor  The staff was wonderful  Over all we enjoyed our stay and would return  Our Sun Wed stay got us a free night so it was a great deal for this class hotel  
N => Great Place to Stay Friendly Staff I stayed  nights for a business trip  I was very surprised by how friendly all of the staff were including the housekeepers and night shift That was unusual  The room was comfortable and there were lots of pluses like complimentary internet access I was not quotwowedquot by the bed and linens but they were reasonably comfortable  It was a good value  
N => Hotel Staff is Five Star The hotel staff couldnt do enough for me As part of our engagement evening I had a couple special items to be delivered to our room at a specific time  They came through where other hotels have not  Why this hotel is not rated higher than  stars is beyond me 
N => My Kind of Place We celebrated our th wedding anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn  It was so much better than I expected  The room was wonderful a corner view Room  and clean and bright  I would recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to chicago  I was really having a hard time iding but price was finally the iding factor  I was pleasantly surprised to have everything including location be so wonderful  the hotel delivered a bottle of champagne and complimentary breakfast passes because it was our anniversary  The staff was pleasant friendly and very helpful with all of our questions  
N => Disappointing The motto du jour of presumably the entire Garden Inn chain is quot  problem freequot  If only that were true We were initially assigned a fully accessible room although neither of us requires nor requested such an accomodation  For those not in the know full accessibility features a cavernous washroom with double wide door an extra tall toilet has a curtained off alcove lined with rungs of handrails in lieue of a bathtub and displays an inconveniently placed showerhead think YMCA  This was in fact a quotproblemquot for my soak craving partner so we immediately called to request a new room  In exchanging the keys we were relieved of our two coupons for free bottles of water from the ill stocked and un manned pantry beside the front desk  Upon arrival one floor up we noted that contrary to our registration profile we were directly between the elevators and the ice machine and that this new room was also accessible although not to the degree that the previous one had been  Tired from our flight we endured the almost constant traffic outside our door and within the wall at the head of our bed where the elevators whirred and hummed until the next morning  We also had to unplug the noisy and empty bar fridge which commenced emitting a sour smell  A second call to the front desk generated assurances that the bellboy would be up momentarily with keys to a third room  After  minutes a third call prompted the receptionist to inform us she would be delivering them personally  As we waited in the hall outside our room with all our baggage for a further  minutes we had to let ourselves back in to answer a call telling us they were now actually really truly on their way  Meeting us by the elevators we were assured that we had been moved to a corner room on the second to highest floor far from the elevators and stairwells  It was in fact not a corner room and was also directly across the hall from a stairwell  It did however have a normal bathroom and a better view  Over our short stay I noted that housekeeping did not thouroughly clean the tub and toilet nor did they fully replenish the amenities on more than one occasion  The bedside table contained not only the requisite bible but also a discarded porn magazine Most troubling though was that this hotel does not offer room service opting instead to rely on the services of third party restaurants in the neighbourhood that close early open late and specialize only in steak and pasta  As such we requested cutlery and plates from the front desk to eat our carry out of Indian food but they simply never arrived    I wish we hadnt either  
N => Great Stay    A few hiccups though My husband and I checked into the Hilton Garden Inn on  and stayed until  and we had a velous trip to the Chicago  We saw a taping of quotThe Jerry Springer Showquot bizarre and sureal went to see the musical quotWickedquot at the Oriental Theater highly recommended and went to see the Black Hawks defeat the St  Louis Blues in overtime  at the United Center  We ate excellent meals at both Heaven on Seven and Redfish see my erate review for Redfish  We also ate at Mother Hubbards which seemed more like a drinking establishment and not a dinner place I would not recommend the ostrich burger  The HGI was an excellent base for our stay and was within walking distance for virtually everything we did although we did take an express bus to and from the hockey game which is highly recommended at   per person each way  The Sears Tower was quite a hike from the HGI but it was a lovely day so we did walk back AND forth but hey it gave us license for eating a great dinner with no guiltAfter taking a cab from Union Station we checked into the HGI on Monday but our key card did not open the door properly and took many tries typically  to get the door to open  This problem happened virtually each and every time we tried to get into our room  Frustrating yes but we learned to lh about it and took bets on how many times it would take Once inside our room we instantly noticed there were no pillows    bizarre but we phoned down to request some and we were told they were to be sent up  Later while unpacking we noticed there was not an iron only an ironing board  When we went out to grocerysnackwine shop at the Jewel Osco store how nice to have a full service grocery store so close by across the street later that afternoon we asked the front desk to send us an iron and also mentioned the room was still without pillows  They apologized and assured us everything would be taken care of  When we returned  minutes later there was a knock on the door and an iron appeared but still NO pillows  It was only after a phone call from the front desk checking on the iron that we reminded them that we still had no pillows  The pillows were then quickly dispatched  I hate to sound like a complainer as these were certainly minor issues but they seemed odd as a cleaning person would certainly notice the absence of pillows and probably notice the missing iron  By the way    the rest of the week the cleaning service was excellent so this could have been just a strange occurrance I would definately stay at the HGI again and the rate of  per night was VERY reasonable  We are not needy nor demanding people so the king bed non smoking room we requested and received suited our needs just fine really it was GREAT We also loved the business center where we could check our email and I was able to get more info regarding the express bus to the United Center saving us tons of money on a cab  We also appreciated the mini refrigerator but did not use the coffee maker nor the microwave  Unfortunately we were too lazy or too tired after some late nights    thats our story and we are sticking too it    to use the pool or the exercise center but they looked great  Also kudos for the blackout curtains at the HGI and they should be standard at every hotel as they overlap in the center so there is not a large ray of light streaming into the room each morning All in all we had a FABULOUS trip to Chicago and the location and ammenities of the Hilton Garden Inn really allowed us to enjoy our stay  I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly attempt to use it again when we return 
N => Just Ok I think Homewood Suites is a better Hilton choice Just returned  The rooms are clean small and just OK  Housekeeping is a weak link  The first day of our stay we returned to the room about  and no housekeeping  We went downstairs to wait in the lobby  About  I asked at the front desk where I was told quotthere is no daily housekeeping unless you callquot  That seemed impossible to believe but I complied by asking for housekeeping every day  The desk clerk said quotYou really want housekeeping every dayquot We are not difficult people but even a Motel  has daily housekeeping for heavens sake  They then put quota rushquot on our room and  minutes later we had clean towels but no clean sheets  We paid  and for that price I gave it three stars  Any more than that would be inappropriate  Valet parking is  a day but we needed the quotunlimitedquot aspects of that service  Unfortunately we forgot to factor that in for a quotwritten in stonequot Sunday morning obligation and were almost late when it took the better part of an hour to get our car  We had called ahead and the valet boys were too busy counting their tips to go and fetch our vehicle  Finally one of them asked if we needed help and we said we had called for our car before we left the room  At that point one of the boys actually stuffed the folding money back into his pocket and went to get our car  Upon leaving we waited several minutes for the valet boys to pocket their tips before moving a car that made it impossible for us to exit  Not cool As Hilton Honors members we thought we would receive preference for our request of a quothigh floorquot  Not so  We were originally placed on the th floor and it was only because I asked about a corner room that we were placed on the th floor  And there are  floors so that wasnt a quotviewquot room  True we are only quotgoldquot level not platinum  Even so  bottles of waters seemed like a minimal acknowledgement of our Hilton loyalty  While we were there we walked  steps to another Hilton property the Homewood Suites  I talked to a staff member there who was really open about the property where Honors Gold members are automatically assigned to the th floor which we verified as being completely non smoking and comprised of actual two room suites which had all the amenities of Hilton Gardenfree hot breakfast plus free cocktailsdinner in the evening Mon  Thurs   A better choice if you have the extra  a night considering you also get a kitchen and guest laundry  All in all having stayed at many downtown hotels Homewood Suites is the best Hilton choice  Embassy Suites down the block has a crowded noisy lobby minimal room furnishings and is the most expensive  Hilton Garden Inn while clean and modest has paper thin walls and no real acknowledgement of Honors benefits  
N => Lovely helpful cheerful staff at the Garden We spent two days mid week here while visiting family  All the usual amenities were up to standard but what we specially noticed was the cheerful and SO helpful staff not so common downtown anywhere  The breakfasts were great too   continental was included in our stay but for  each we could have  the works including omeletttes and such cooked to order  This is the fifth Chicago hotel weve tried and the first weve liked enough to want to come back to  
N => Great Very good experience overall  The staff was friendly and helpful  The room was nice  no complaints  The location is great  Check out was very easy didnt even have to stop by the front desk  Id recommend it to anyone  Easy no hassle trip 
N => Nice hotel  Great Location Hotel was clean and in good condition  Staff was extremely helpful and was very good at giving us different restaurant ideas  Having been to Chicago numerous times it was nice to get different ideas and having them pan out  Rooms were clean and had everything you would need  Not spectacular rooms but very nice  
N => Beautiful friendly secure    I work at a Hilton Garden Inn in another city and was not disappointed by the quality of this hotel by any means  The guest service and valet staff was friendly knowledgeable and accommodating Our guest room was incredibly clean at a comfortable temperature and even had a ent view for being surrounded by high rises  We bugged the front desk staff multiple times for directions locations of attractions recommendations etc  Every time they were just as happy to help as if it were our first question Our do not disturb sign was on from check in to check out and we were not disturbed once In my experience with past stays at other hotels throughout the years a do not disturb sign still means we can be bothered about towels and such  It was a pleasure to have the room all to ourselves Our stay was the weekend before St  Patricks day  The parade was happening as well as the green coloring of the river  The elevators were only accessible by key card  It was nice to have such security with a hard partying crowd outside The hotel is connected with a P F  Changs and another great restaurant the name escapes me they make grills though  These restaurants will deliver to your room if you like Theres nothing like Changs chicken lettuce wraps and mago iced tea in your pajamasIf you get the chance I highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Chicago  
N => nice and clean We stayed at the Chicago Hilton Garden Inn over the Labor Day weekend and were delighted  It is very clean not tired and worn out but seems bright and new  The one special thing I liked was a top sheet on top of the blanket  I very much appreciated not having to touch that blanket  It also had all of the amenities e g  microwave refrigerator hair dryer computer connections etc  The room was not especially large but we spent relatively little time in the room   only to sleep  We would definitely stay here again  
N => great place to stay in chicago this hilton gardens was the place to stay  at   a night through hilton com this was the best deal by far  excellent location to everything  michigan ave  was just a few blocks and the red line was just outside the door which made it very easy to get to wrigley field  resturants galore were so easy to get to  the staff was GREAT  starbucks in the lobby was nice but only open in the morning  never made it to quotWebersquot for any meals but it did smell wonderful  the biggest complant were the sheets they were way to small for the bed and always had to tuck them back under the mattress during the night  valet was   with in and out privileges or you can park across the street for   but with NO privileges  if you come with your kids make sure you check out the quotEspn zonequot great things to keep a kid happy and yes great food also  
N => We Love It   
N => Hilton Garden Inn  
N => great location nice hotel This hotel was booked when we arrived and they told me that our room was a handicapped room  Im not sure why they gave us that but we went up to it and didnt like it very much especially the shower  So later that afternoon we asked to switch and they did switch us but it was to a room with two queen beds instead of one king  The room was much nicer so Im definitely glad they could switch us The service was not so great the whole time  We tried to go to the concierge desk two arate times and both times no one was there  We waited  minutes one time and eventually the bellhop helped us a little bit  This was sorely disappointing However the hotel was in a very good location two blocks from Michigan Avenue and overall the hotel was nice  
N => Good location but amenities are pretty basic The location was very good close to shopping restaurants and sight seeing which was convenient  We were able to walk or take short cab rides wherever we wanted to go  The hotel was quiet even though fully booked and the room was clean enough but when we arrived it reeked of cigarette smoke though it was supposedly a a non smoking room  Fortunately the windows open and we were able to air it out  Despite being a quotsuitequot it was a tight fit for our family of   The beds in the bedroom were comfortable though small for  people full not queen but the pull out couch was truly atrocious  broken springs and extremely thinworn mattress  If you can make due without it youll be much better off  The bathroom was small but updated however the closet was miniscule and had only  hangers so we each got to hang up just one thing  The one dresser matched the closet in size so we each had one tiny drawer  Needless to say storage was a big problem  Small microwave and refrigerator in the living area both of which functioned without problems  We didnt try the restaurant but the kids enjoyed the pool  Again nothing fancy  The staff seemed very friendly and helpful and the price was reasonable but honestly Id be willing to pay more next time for a little more space and comfort  Oh and it seems that this hotel is where Lufthansa flight crews stay on their layovers so the lobby was constantly full of their uniformed personnel every time we passed through the lobby  no big deal but made getting elevators a problem a few times  
N => Good location   horrible couch bed The location of this hotel was great   one block from Water Tower Place   ent walk to Navy Pier etc  I didnt think the front desk did a very good job   we were checking in to a room that a friend had reserved with reward points   since he wasnt getting in until later he called ahead to clear us getting there first and FAXed all the information they requested  We still had a problem checking in and they never bothered to look for the FAX The rooms are a ent size since you have a living area and a bedroom but the sofa bed was disgusting and broken  Unfortunately we didnt discover this until we pulled out the bed for the night and my son sat on the corner and fell right through There were no springs on the left side nothing was even attached to the frame  The extra blanket in the closet was also disgusting with black oil stains all over it  Never received room service the second day because they showed up at  PM when we were resting from a day out  
N => There are better hotels for the same price We drove right by it first time because they have a E  Delaware St  address but the entrance is actually on another street around the corner  When we reserved we were promised an early check in but when we arrived we were told wed have to wait till  the normal time  Front desk staff wasnt friendly at all  Suite was nice but not exceptional  Desk chair was extremely uncomfortable and the high speed internet extra fee didnt work much of the time  Room cleaning didnt arrive until late afternoon The restaurant is probably operated independently but dinner at Cafe Med was an ordeal requiring extreme patience  Dessert alone took over  hour because the quotmanagerquot who was waiting on us spent his time talking to diners familiar to him and was offended when we requested slightly quicker service  We were ignored for long periods of time  Unless youre a regular find another place for dinner I would not stay here again  There are better places for the same money  
N => Pretty Good Nice hotel good location view from the th floor wasnt up to much but we were on a freebie so didnt complain  Room was large and clean and bed comfortable  Woman behind the desk wasnt that friendly or competent  It took a while to check in and i had to come back down as the key card didnt work first time  
N => Awesome I booked this hotel on priceline and paid only   We stayed on a Sunday night  Upon arrival you learn that there is no private parking only valey and it is  dollars a night  THey were super friendly though  HOtel was gorgeous  had to wait an hour to check in as we were there an hour early  SPent that hour at the pool which was ok it was on the th floor so that was cool  there was a sauna   once we got in our rooms my jaw dropped   so NICE bed was super comfy the location was great though walked home from the bars on rush shopping on michigan avenue i mean super great location  check out was nice and they even held our bags for us after we were checked out so we could walk around a little more to do some shopping  Overall awesome 
N => Not The Best If You Expect Service This hotel has nicely reated suites but thats where the good news ends  We are Hilton Honor members but that means nothing to the management here  If you think you can check in at the stated check in time at  dont get your hopes up  We couldnt check in until  but had to check out on  time the next day  I asked if they would compensate us for that somehow be a free drink or breakfast I was answered with an indifferent quotNo we dont do thatquotI requested extra towels but never got them  There wasnt any extra toilet paper in the room  We asked the concierge where was a good place to eat and she snapped quotEverything is booked until  quot She eventually got us a reservation but it was grudging  Odd job for someone with this temperament  We travel frequently and this is the first time I have been motivated to write this kind of review  Luckily most of our travel experiences have been positive  
N => Good but    I do agree with other reviews about the location of this hotel   perfect for doing all the things Chicago requires  We visit Chicago often every other month and stay wherever the rooms are the least expensive  Needless to say we have stay at a few This Hilton is one that I would stay in again and again  However all was not perfect  The hotel was hot And I dont mean the Paris way It was hot  The workout facilities were far too warm  Good equipment but hot Even the room was hot  The HVAC is the one thing in our room that was not updated  Probably an expensive undertaking but still  This is a Hilton  I had the windows open all night to keep it cool and it did not really help  At least I had a beautiful view of the lake over the rooftops  Everything else was good  Try it  I liked it but NOT in the summer when heat is not what you want  
N => A Wicked time in Chicago We had a great time at the Hilton Suites Chicago  When we arrived I was able to check in and get my room keys from the check in machine in the lobby which saved us a lot of time since there was a line at the Hilton Hhonors desk  We were in our room in a flash and ready to settle in The first thing I noticed when we walked in the room was the nice living area of the suite  There was a wet bar in one corner along with a desk a couch and a flat screen TV  You could access the bathroom and the bedroom from the living area  There were three in our party my sister in law my seven year old dhter and myself  My dhter loved the flat screen TV and it wasnt long before she found the Cartoon NetworkThe bedroom area of the suite was really small  There was just enough room to walk around the beds  There was also a door from the bedroom to the bathroom  Having the dual access to the bath was nice  We didnt have to plow through our mess in the bedroom to get there There was also a TV in the bedroom The bathroom was also tiny  With   women trying to get ready it got a little crowded  I ended up setting my compact mirror on the desk in the living area so my SIL could get in the bathroom to shower  A vanity arate from the bath wouldve been nice Our service was for the most part stellar  All of the employees were friendly and cheerful  The concierge was helpful but not exceptionally friendly but all of the people we spoke to at the front desk were great  We didnt try the restaurant but were able to redeem our free breakfast coupons in the little coffee shop in the hotel  You gotta love Krispy Kreme doughnutsThe only glitch we ran into was on our last night there  It was a Saturday night and my dhter wanted to hit the pool  The pool was to close in  minutes but I thought we could get in a quick dip  When we got in the elevator it wouldnt go to the floor where the pool was  I called the front desk and they assured me that my key card should work and to just try again  We tried again to no avail  I called the front desk again only to be informed that the pool had closed for the night  I was a little peeved because it was supposed to be open another  minutes but there wasnt much we could do about it Overall we had a great stay  The bellmen were great and very helpful  The hotel was convenient to Michigan Avenue and there was a bus stop just down the street about a block  I would definitely stay here again  
N => Good place to stay Nice hotel  Used to be doubletree suites  Just south of Drake hotel  Remodeled property    much better place than as a doubletree quotquot rooms on every floor are in quiet location and have partial view of lake great pool on top of hotel ent fitness roomscould use more weight equipment Only negativeas this was uary was there is a cold draft in that hotel  air comes in the window crevices windows are floor to ceiling  Food in restuarnt only fair  Would stay again    
N => Great hotel We booked this hotel for a girls week end get away and wanted something close to all the shopsfoodsights  We arrived earlier than check in time and found a room was ready  The staff was very polite  Our room was perfect  Plenty of room for  of us to sprawl our bags and stuff  The rooms have a mini fridge and microwave and wet bar as well as  tvs and a ent sized bathroom  No noise on our floor th  Actually we never saw anyone our short stay there  Close to John Hancock and Water Tower place  Cabs are ready waiting for you if you need one  Would definitely stay again  We didnt try the restaraunt but did have Starbucks coffee from the little shop in the lobby  
N => Measure Those Beds and Fix the Air Conditioning My husband and I booked a room at the Hilton Suites based on the Tripadvsior reviews  Supposedly all the rooms have a king size bed but when we arrived we could see immediately that the bed in our room was NOT a king by any stretch  We called the front desk to make sure that they had indeed booked us for a king size bed and were told that yes that ALL of their beds were king size  We knew that this bed was not king sized and we were not about to stay in the tiny little bed so we asked for the manger on duty  The manger accompanied us to see another room and when she returned to our room she realized that the bed in our room was indeed smaller  She did move us to the other room but it was a pain to repack and lug our belongings to the new floor  We wondered how many other rooms were being advertised as having a king size bed that instead had one like the one in our first room  The manger did give us breakfast coupons which was very nice of her but it does not change the fact that if you ask for a king size bed you might get stuck instead with one of the small ones  looked like a double Be sure to ask about this if you call for a reservation  And check it out once you get into the room  There were a few other problems as well  the air conditioner did not work and the room was as hot as hades during the night  Bathroom bulb was burned out and not replaced during our stay even though we left a note for housekeeping  The pool is very nice  although a bit small  It was warm and enjoyable for swimming  Because of its small size though the number of children in there with their parents made it difficult to manuever and stay out of the way  All in all we found this place just OK  Weve been to Chicago many times and we were looking for a new adventure  Well not come back here again  
N => Wonderful Hotel Overall I had a wonderful Stay at the Hilton  Right across the street from the John Hancock building   walk out the door to magnificent mile  The valet could be slow at times but I was only charged for one night when I really had the car for two nights  Not sure if that was on purpose or not but the manager did take notice at the time of the delay  Staff was very friendly and helpful  The beds were extremely comfortable As a Hilton Diamond member I was given free continental breakfast   sure it wasnt a buffet but compared to the other hotels in the area it was great  They really only offer continental breakfast for up to two people and I had three so they through in extra tickets  Also I paid for one night two double beds and had  free nights one king bed they allowed me to stay in the double room the whole time  Couldnt ask for a better stay  I will surely return to this location  
N => Appalling and Unethical Billing I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago with a couple of my girlfriends from grad school  Loved the city other than the wind  Absolutely disgusted with the Hilton Suites we stayed in  A couple of weeks after returning home I happened to check my credit card balance to find a extra  charge from the hotel  Assuming it was some kind of mistake I called to let the hotel know  They proceded to tell me that they did not know what the charge was at that time but that they would call me back  I gave my phone number email and name  They proceeded to call one of the other girls who stayed in the room and to tell her the charge was for quottrashingquot the room I can assure you we left the room in perfect condition with all of our quottrashquot by the door  We barely spent any time in the room as it is  The manager told me they had a report and pictures of the damage to the room but when I requested they send copies to me with an explanation of the  charge he insisted he was not allowed to do that  Can you imagine it is their word against mine and they dont have to provide any type of receipt or evidence but can charge me this ridiculous charge Something in this scenario does not add up  Im disputing the charge through my credit card company but feel this is completely unbelievable not to mention unethical  I am over the  but not the principle  I will never stay in a Hilton and am passing this information on to spare others this experience  
N => This place has many faults I was in chicago to celebrate my mothers th birthday  I was given a pleasant room on the th Floor by a delightful manager Christine Thank You  Upon arrival Friday  I nor my wife were assisted withour bags by doorman whoi were busy chatting  The cab fare from Oharewas  dollars and valet parking was  per day  On Saturday I we took cab from hotel to field Museum which cost  plus tip  Therese no street parking around downtown Chicago so by mid day I ided to rent a car  We had dinner at a Cheesecake factory restuarant upon our return across the street in the Hancock tower  Onwe took a trip to a Harrahs Casino in Joliet which is about a  minute drive  The hotel has no in room safe so i stored several electronic devives in my hard side samsonite TSA approved luggage  Upon return I went to pack for departure th e next day the lock was broken on one side  I filed a report with hotel security and made a follow up call but have heard nothing  We went to an early lunch at The Signature Room on the  Floor of the Hancock Tower which has a lunch buffet for   M S excluding drinks and dessert  Restaurant has spectacular views so skip the observatory  Overall Chicago is nice but as expensive as New York 
N => Great location Hotel was in a very convienient location to Navy Pier  In addition you had easy access to public transportation right off of yland  Cabs were readily available if you are not into buses or the trainsubway  Hotel was exceptionally clean during my visit  They are changing to the Hilton name and were doing some painting but it was very early in the morning and was not a bother at all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  The fact the rooms are suites is convenient for two adults and up to two children  The pull out couch isnt comfortable enough for adults to use for very long Staff was pleasant  Didnt use room service but heard good things about it from others who did  
N => Good Place Good place for a family to stay  Our suite was large enough for the  of us   parents and teenager  The suite had all we needed and included a nice view   we could see a bit of Lake Michigan  We liked the proximity to local sites not a far walk to the subway and it was always easy to get a taxi when necessary  Overall it was a nice clean place to stay if you want to be in downtown Chicago  
N => Eh For the cost of this hotel you can find much better elsewhere in the city  I requested early check in and could not get into the room early  I ended up checking if  after  the check in time because the room was not ready  The woman at the check in desk was rude The towels in the room were very thin and torn  The pool was cold  No cookies  
N => Dont count on the pool We live in the suburbs of Chicago but stayed here for two nights over spring break in ch  We thought it would be fun to enjoy the city and a pool  Well forget about the pool  It is small and was extremely crowded  We tried to go three times  Finally we went early in the morning  It was still crowded but the kids were determined to swim  It was really loud and not too much fun  The hotel was ok otherwise but dont go if you are counting on enjoying a pool  
N => Not a bad stay This hotel was good for the money we paid  I booked it a couple of months in advance of our ch  stay  We paid nt for two adults and  kids ages  to  Our priy goal this trip was make a pilgrimage to the Mecca of all doll stores the American Girl Place  This hotel was very convenient to that store as well as to other great stores on Michigan Ave and the lakeshore  In fact after arriving we walked down to the lake and along the lakefront  Check in was good  received the damn cookies   which of course made the kids even more wired than they already were after a  hour car ride Got a room on the th floor  All rooms are suites but I would classify them as small suites  The refrigerator was jammed with the mini bar crap and hardly any room for the stuff we brought and wanted to refrigerate  TV in main area was small and too low   almost on the ground tough to watch the NCAA Final Four Beds bathroom were fine Fitness area was nice pool on the th floor is neat but it was pretty small  Whirlpool is nice sized  Nice menwomen locker rooms for showering after swimming  Tried the hotel restaurant not bad interesting but limited menu expensive This hotel definitely has a feel of a reated hotel where they spruced her up a bit but didnt go the full  yards  However for downtown Chicago the location and price are attractive and we would stay there again  
N => Stay away  
N => The Doubletree was Great
