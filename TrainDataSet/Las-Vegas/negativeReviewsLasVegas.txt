N =>  very dissapointed in their customer service was there with my friend for a convention after i assured her ballys was a great choice since i have stayed there many times    we arrived at about      am  when we checked in the girl at the counter did not appear to know what she was doing we stood there for over   mins when the stay was already paid for  aggravated i asked why it was taking so long    there was no apology and we were given our keys    went to bed since we had the convention in a couple of hours    until we were sitting at lunch and we were paying and her card gets declined   wasting time  and multiple calls to her bank it showed that ballys had overdrawn an extra     dlls on her account plus the   nights that has already been paid for  i was very dissapointed and upset since it was my idea to stay there    went up to the counter i figured it would be something to be resolved quickly    they gave us the run around saying it would get fixed that day and it didn t    the next two days were multiple visits to the representatives at the counter with promises that never happened  they were short and rude as if it was her fault and not theirs    we are now in march and they still have not fixed their mistake keeping money that does not belong to them  i am embarrased to see my friend so stressed calling everyday trying to fix this  we all know that such amount of money will throw off all your automatic payments and that overdraft fees are not cheap and they add up very quick   as a result of this after being their customer for many years that was my last stay there and never again will i recommend them to any of my friends or family     
N =>   outdated furniture Just got back from our trip to LV  Stay was wonderful  but our room was not too comfy  although  it was huge  amp  bathroom was too  Furniture was outdated  didn t seem too clean either  But we didn t spend too much time in the room anyways  The table dealers  amp  bartenders were extremely friendly though  which was great  
N =>   Love It spacious rooms  excellent view  wonderful staff we ll be back  perfect hotel to stay in the strip is central to all the malls and the hotels  the show  jubilee  was excellent overall my stay at bally swas perfect i will go back any time lLOVE IT  
N =>   Perfect place to stay I was a bit nervous about staying at Ballys after reading some of these reviews  but my worries were all for nothing  We arrived at   am  our check in went smoothly and they did offer us an upgrade for     a night  but the clerk suggested that we not take it if we were only going to be using the room for sleeping  Ours was an older room but it was perfectly fine   comfy beds  awesome view   you can t get any better than this  Would definitely stay there again  
N =>   What A Nightmare      of us went out to Vegas for my wedding  we had to check out at    am on Sunday and had to leave our luggage with the bell hop people including my wedding dress because our flight was not until later that evening  When it was time to leave Bally s and get our luggage I was MORTIFIED at what I saw when they brought me my wedding dress that was in a nice bag from David s Bridal that I purchased  It looked like they took the bag and literally ran it through a shredder then dragged it up and down the strip   When I brought it to their attention they laughed at me    I just could not believe that I was treated like this  and we spent A LOT of money at this hotel  On our wedding night our dinner alone cost over      at their Steakhouse  but we were just another dollar to them  I would not send my dog to this hotel to stay   The staff is rude and uncaring  the rooms smell and they don t even have ventilation fans in the bathrooms  you can t open the windows it is just a nasty hotel as far as the rooms and the staff  The casino is decent  God knows we spent enough time there  
N =>   Great stay great hotel great location  We arrived Sunday afternoon to check in   there was quite a line but it moved fast  Had a very friendly and professional young lady check us in  We had booked a South Tower room  but was given a North Tower room    st floor  facing airport  Very big bathroom  wonderful linens  everything super clean  The TV was  quot haunted quot   turning off on by itself  changing channels on it s own   a call to maintenance and we were told the hotel really was haunted  but they would still send someone up to look at it  No one came  but it really was no big deal as we were not there to watch TV Went down to explore the casino and sign up for the players card  couldn t find the booth  asked two employees and no one knew where to send us   turns out they closed the on site player s booth and we would have to go to Paris  No biggie  we thought  Well  it s WAY on the other side of Paris from Bally s  We eventually found it and signed up  The casinos in both hotels were very quiet  and it turns out it was the case everywhere we went One negative experience  we had a letter in our room at check in that offered us discounted tickets to both Jubiliee there in Bally s and Penn  amp  Teller at Rio  We wanted to see Penn  amp  Teller  so in the morning we went down to the box office and was told quite rudely that to get the discounted price  we had to go to Rio and buy the tickets there  I protested that the letter didn t say that and we didn t want to waste time going there now in the morning  but she didn t seem to care  As it turned out we took a chance to buy the tickets right before the show  got nine rows back center stage for half price an hour before showtime  It was a great show and the price was terrific  Penn  amp  Teller greeted the audience after the show to sign autographs and that was very nice Played a bit at Bally s  cocktail service was very quick and friendly at both slots and tables  It was about the only major Strip casino that we saw cocktailers of all ages and sizes   and we thought that was very cool  Every casino employee we dealt with were terrific   fun dealers  nice waitresses  They had a great band in the lounge called JAMM  really enjoyed them  Moving walkway to the Strip was not working our first day  but was up by the second day  The walkway to Paris is very nice and convenient  with lots of neat shops and restaurants  We dined at LeVillage Buffet in Paris for dinner and it was very good  Used the shuttle to Rio and it was fast and convenient We would most definitely stay at Bally s again  the location is terrific and convenient to the best on the Strip  Super friendly staff for the most part  and very well kept property  
N =>  Bally s RUINED my ENTIRE weekend   Where do I start   I went for the Vemma Royale Convention which was held at Bally s hotel in Vegas  I drove from San Diego  got there about      am  checked in and went to bed  Next day we went to lunch and my credit card declined   Bally s had charged my card almost      IN ADDITION to what I had already payed to stay there for   nights  I went to the front desk  they apologized said they will take care of their  quot mistake quot  To make a very long story as short as possible  they never fixed the problem  They over drew my bank account  so all bills I had paid prior to going bounced  I had no   whatsoever for the entire weekend  not even to eat  after many managers  supervisors and a whole lot of stress  all they can do is offer me   tickets to Jubillee their show  im sorry but how about some FOOD   They finally gave me      food credit for the weekend until they can reverse the charges they added to my card  Well  I wasn t even able to go to my training class for Vemma which was the purpose of my trip because of dealing with what they did to me  trying to straighten things out  NOTHING GOT STRAIGHTENED OUT  Just a bunch of empty promises  I didnt have enough gas to get back home  but they didnt care  I had to borrow money from someone to get home   days later  They promised to credit everything back  plus all my overdraft fees which now total over        It is now   WEEKS LATER and guess what    I AM STILL NEGATIVE IN MY BANK  have went thru hell these past   weeks  got my cell phone shut off  my husbands phone is shut off  everything is a mess because of their  quot mistake quot  and have caused me a lot of emotional stress and completely broke and not knowing what to do  they havent given me the credit they promised and i dont understand why  what is so hard about fixing the mistake when they are such a big company   im extremely pissed off and have a constant headache  I have now moved up to corporate i am tired of dealing with people who don t knw what they are doing  im done  This has been the worst trip i have ever taken to Vegas   THANKS ALOT BALLY S MANAGERS  by the way  I hope the staff feels good about me having to take my kids to eat at my moms because i cant even afford to buy them a double cheeseburger for     cents  and im not kidding  This is a true story  BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU STAY THERE  CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARDS DEBIT CARDS RIGHT AWAY   SOO SOOO SAD   
N =>   Bally s a Great Place to stay My H and I arrived in Vegas on Thursday morning of         at     am  When we arrived at McCarran  I discovered that one of my bags was missing  That started the trip on a downer  but I was sure they would find my bag eventually We had hired a car to pick us up  The driver was at baggage claim awaiting our arrival  All went smooth  We arrived at Bally s in a timely manner I will go through the major topics  If you have any questions  please feel free to ask  I am a new Diamond member  We reserved our hotel from         and received   comp days and had to pay     for the Saturday night Checkin   Checkin was smooth  There was a short line  but it moved smoothly  Being a new Diamond member  I didn t know that I could have bypassed the line  The lady at the desk told me  I was given a King Suite in the North Tower  The room was ready so we headed up Rooms   The rooms are fairly large  They needed some upkeep but they were clean and well kept  The King Suite didn t look like a suite to me  but I had nothing to compare it to  It was nice Casino   ALL of the Dealers were fantastic  The staff at Ballys were phenomenal  I really have nothing bad to say about any of the employees  They were great  They had quite a few    tables  We had a good time Paris   We walked over to Paris a few times  The casino and its dealers were very nice   we had a good time  but their tables would go up pretty often  so we always went back to Bally s  Its really funny    I normally play      but I don t like a casino to tell me that s the lowest I can play   I like the option to play less if I so choose We visited Hard Rock  Rio  Riviera  Had a ball there   Gold Coast  they took out a lot of their tables  and Paris All in all we had a fabulous time  We would definetly stay at Bally s again  and in the end we stayed another day and got comped for our entire stay  We didn t have to pay a dime Food   We mostly ate room service  but we went to Bally s Steakhouse and the cafe   both were nice  but of course the Steakhouse was fantastic  The food was great  but a bit over priced Bally s could use a renovation  peeling paint  old decor  etc   but all in all it is a nice property and we would definetly stay again  Below I have rated our hotels from the best to the least best  Please note that we have never stayed anywhere that was horrible Planet Hollywood  the bathroom was the best Mirage  Everything was nice Bally sExcaliburLuxorRiviera  in no way a bad property  just the lowest of where we stayed  
N =>  Bally s in Las Vegas has poor sercurity system and bad management style we have been Las Vegas for so many times  but first time stayed at Bally s  My husband lost his pants and cellphone at Swimming pool  They couldn t find the thief because their survaliance system not working  After we reported to the hotel manager  they just say  quot  Sorry  but there is nothing they can do about it   quot  They leted us deal with the claim department  which is end up we re not qulified for anything  We will never go back to stay at Bally s again  Terrible  Terrible   Terrible experience    
N =>   great location We stayed at Ballys for our first trip to Las Vegas  The location was great  We could walk to just about everyplace we wanted to go  Took the bus a couple of times  The hotel was clean and comfortable  No problems with check in  housekeeping etc  The outside pool area looked nice  but it was too cold to use it  closed for the season anyway  They have a shuttle that takes you to the airport for a nominal fee  cheaper than a taxi  Not much of a gambler but had fun playing slots  
N =>   great experience I had a great experience at Bally s  I booked a room in the South Tower but they upgraded me to the North Tower without even asking  The room was very clean and large  I did not have to wait long at check in  The best thing about Bally s is their central location  I am looking forward to going back sometime  
N =>   Wow What A Great Room My wife and I just returned from Las Vegas from our honeymoon we spent   days   nights at Ballys  We were given a king Suite with everything you could possible want in a room  From the hot tub to king bed to safe to what a view of the city this room had it all    Would recommend to anyone for the price you cant beat Ballys Las Vegas      The slot machines are tight at this casino we didnt win anything at all but didnt do too bad at the tables     If you get to vegas stay at Ballys  
N =>  Don t waste your money My friend and I booked our stay at Bally s through a website  When we got there we were offered a Deluxe room at an additional    per day  The deluxe rooms were renovated with additional amenities and better views  We agreed to this  but then were told that the room would not be ready until   pm  We agreed to return at that time and check in  When we returned  we were told our room was given away and there was only the lower floors available  We were upset by this since we agreed to what we were offered to begin with  and then we waited for   hours to get it  To compensate us the manager offered to only charge us for three nights of the upgrade price rather than the five days we were staying  At this point we had no other choice but to take that offer  The day before we checked out we looked at our bill and saw that the bill included charges for five days of the upgraded     day  We called the front desk  spoke with that manager and went through the whole story again  He agreed to take off the   days like we originally agreed to  Then at check out time  you guessed it  The full charges for the five days were back on the bill again  We went through the whole thing again for the third time  This manager was not helpful at all  He kept insisting there was nothing he could do about it  I told him to speak with the two other managers who already agreed to removing the two additional night charges  He said he would look into it and email me what he finds out  That was two days ago and I have not received an email  nor have I received my reduced compensations that was promised upon check in  I would not recommend this hotel for any reason  The  quot Deluxe quot  room didn t look any different than any other room  It did not have any extras  the carpet was stained  there were no bedspreads  It was a total waste of money  The view was of the rooftop with lights shining right into our window  And they are so disorganized  they don t even know what each other is doing because they don t put notes in the computer to verify what they have promised the guests  
N =>  Bad experience in Bally s We just returned from Las Vegas on          Our trip was great except having a bad time in Bally s  We were treated impolitely when we did the check in  The staff s attitude was rude and not professional  We couldn t even see a smile or a pleasant look on her face  After checking in  we asked for a map of Vegas Strip at the Bell Desk  the staff didn t say anything but just tore off a page  map  from a magazine and gave us that  quot map quot   he then threw the whole magazine into the garbage bin right away  Do you want to be treated in this way on your very first day of holidays  When we entered to the hotel room  we were surprised that the room was smelly and dusty  we d been told that it was a non smoking room and we d paid at a regular rate for staying for three nights   Moreover  there was an empty envelope with coffee marks left on the bedside table  There were no coffee  maker  no hot cold water  no fridge in the room  We stayed three nights in the hotel and we found the room service was terrible  They just replenished the soap  shampoo and towels but not changing any bedsheets or cleaning the room for you  Anyways  if you don t want your trip to be spoiled with bad hotel service  please remember to stay away from Bally s  Good Luck  
N => Romance retreat package at Bellagio highly recommended  This was a truly memorable package offered by the Bellagio  Check out the Bellagio web site for further info  It s a splurge for a night  but it was well worth it  My BF and I enjoyed fantastic service  from the limo transport and VIP check in  to the couples massage  Mike intuitively knew exactly where the sore spots were    to the magical dining experience at Picasso  my BF cannot stop raving about the fallow deer he had   to the stunning Cypress suite  loved the  quot his quot  and  quot hers quot  ensuites and the incredible view of the fountains from the panoramic windows   I cannot imagine a better experience than this  We ordered room service for breakfast  it was delivered promptly  and was very tasty  The only negative comment I will include here is the call I had to make to housekeeping when we checked into our suite  Both ensuites have an in laid carpet in the center of the marble floor  and these carpets had clearly NOT been vacuumed  as they were covered in hair  It was quite noticeable and I was disappointed in that obvious lack of housekeeping  Housekeeping did send someone immediately to vacuum  and the rest of our stay was seamless and very pleasant  Do yourself a favour and book this package before it disappears  
N => Amazing college graduation gift trip My husband and I delivered on a promise to take our   daughters on a trip to Vegas  This trip was planned in tember and taken during the   days before our US Thanksgiving holiday  My husband and I have traveled throughout much of the world and stayed in many top rated hotels  The Bellagio suite exact name  was by far the most comfortable room we have ever stayed in on any of our travels  We had a full sized living room and dining table for our family  The room included his and hers bath sections plus a powder bath  You never see suite rooms like this in Europe  We booked a deluxe Lakeview room for our daughters and they could not have been happier We ate at Jasmine our first night  The music playing to the Bellagio fountains was an amazing sensory experience  This is a do not miss if you are staying in this hotel  Our last night we ate at Olives restaurant spectaular  just be forewarned it is very pricy  If you want to see Cirque d Soleil  quot O quot  at their theater do not wait until you arrive  Book at least   weeks early if you want good seats  
N => easy to like look for deals We were able to get a good deal due to the time we were traveling and booking way in advance  Even though we checked in early and the front desk was a madhouse we got a room right away  Dumped the bags and took off with friends  Easy to catch a cab to other hotels casinos if we didn t want to walk Enjoyed a leisurely late lunch at the cafe enough food that we only needed a snack the rest of the day You had other places to hang out besides the casino Felt very luxurious  not as overdone as other hotels we saw on the Strip 
N => Perfect stay Having stayed at the Wynn in a Parlor Suite   months ago  I was a bit worried to try the Bellagio  I feared we would be disappointed  Fortunately we had a fantastic week end there We had requested a pick up at the airport  it was a standard Bellagio Limo  offered by the hotel  We had made a reservation for a   bedroom penthouse and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a huge executive suite     sqm       sqf     phones     flat screen TVs from a small one in the bathroom to a    quot  one in the dining room  located in the Spa Tower View from the bedroom was very nice  towards the Paris  amp  lake  but it was not so great from the living room  back of the hotel and train station   City Center  We had access to the executive lounge  no long queues  and line pass  Breakfast buffet was fabulous  but I was not impressed at all with the d cor Use of the minibar was complimentary  I do not know if it was a favor thanks to Amex Centurion  Overall I would say that public parts are less impressive than the Wynn  and you have to walk a lot more  But the situation on the Strip is unbeatable  and value is much higher  depending on the season I guess  For those who wonder if it is possible to enjoy the swimming pool by late ember  at least in      yes it was  Several pools were closed but there was still one  large enough  with people sunbathing and having a swim  
N =>   Right Hotel First visit to Las Vegas    hrs   min flight  torture   Had originally booked the Luxor  but as a surprise for my husband  big birthday  paid extra and moved hotels before departure from the UK  At this point I must say this was the right decision  Bellagio is the most central of hotels on the strip  When we arrived check in was empty so that was quite quick although couldnt get a fountain view room  shame  Reception staff a bit stand offish  Hotel is beautiful bit Disney  Talking Tree   Casino is nowhere near as smokey as I expected  and yes I am a smoker  needed a cardi in the evening because air con is so good  A security guard is located by the lift lobby to check you have room cards  for the safety of your room belongings and yourself  didnt find this a problem at all and our room was really close to lifts which was a result as corridors looked like they went on forever  rooms are good  little dark and maybe update TV s but didnt go to Vegas to stay in a room       Seem to win most of our winnings in Bellagio  Took us two days to adjust to the time difference but there is an    eatery  Cafe Bellagio  but felt weird eating at  am in the morning  and yes people were still gambling   Also used  Snacks  for a quick sandwich  amp  coffee  did the Buffet Breakfast queued a little not bad  food was plentiful  No coffee tea maker in room  took a travel kettle with me as like to wake up with a hot drink   Dont touch anything in the minibar as it is all weighted and if it registers a lower weight you are charged for the item There are loads of places to eat along the strip so you dont have to pay   star prices everyday  Whilst in Vegas saw the  Blue Man Group   ok  and  The Jersey Boys   great would like to see again   Both booked with the Concierge  Used the Monorail  entrance by Ballys just use the overhead walkway  Some of the hotels are linked together by corridors on the side so sometimes you dont even realise you have left one and entered another   Started at one end of the strip  Stratosphere  and got on  amp  off at every stop and investigated as many Hotels Casino s on the strip as we could and we didnt miss many but our legs were rigid by end of day  did ask another tourist where M amp M World was she said only one block away  that felt like a mile  Didnt really use cabs apart from seeing the shows in the Palazzo  amp  Venetian  BUT wanted a really nice meal and a cab driver recommended  Lawrys    great meal steak  Also Cheecake to die for at the  Cheesecake Factory  inside Caesars Palace  even took a piece to go  Will I go back  yep as soon as possible but will probally stay at Paris Hotel as would still get the Bellagio Fountain View but at a lower price  More money for shopping   lol  So much to do  amp  see but not enough time  Grand Canyon next time and didnt get to Treasure Island   Mirage  Wynn  Luxor considering how many hotels there are actually didnt miss very few  As a closing point I just need to point out I hate gambling  but I ve been converted  Viva Las Vegas   
N =>   Does not live up to its reputation  First impressions on check in are of how enormous and busy the hotel is   checked into our room which was dark and dreary  with a view of a massive building site   not quite what we were expecting   when we requested to change rooms we were told that there was no other room available so had to stay put  The fountains are pretty but that is about it really   service was not good and the whole place was just teeming with people everywhere   a relief to check out after   days  To be fair  I have no idea how it compares to other hotels in Las Vegas  but I wont be going back again  
N =>   Not as great as I thought it would be  We just returned from our stay at the Bellagio  The check in went fairly easy  impersonal  but ok  We found our room  the view of the fountains was fantastic  Luckily my husband knew that they had a station on the TV that played the music because we could not find any information about this in the room  we had to call the front desk to find out the channel it was playing on       We discovered some sort of dried excriment on our toilet  near the handle for flushing  We called down to housekeeping on day one  it did not get cleaned  On day   we were walking in the lobby and happened to run into the Hotel Manager  we told him about the mess on the toilet  he promised to walk through the room himself and take care of it  He did not  The grossness was still there  It was dried on mind you so I was not about to scrub it off my self  Day   we happened to come back while housekeeping was there and we showed it to him  He finally cleaned it up  but was slow and not very friendly while we waited for him to finish cleaning the room  We did have a delightful breakfast at the Billagio Cafe  We were not impressed with the overall experience at such an expensive hotel  
N =>   Smoke filled place    stay away  This place is crowded and beyond smoked filled  I could barely breathe and had to check out immediately  
N =>   LUXURY Coming from a small town in Wales staying in this hotel was like finding oneself in a diferent world  Awesome   
N =>   Much Improved My husband and I made our annual trip to Las vegas     th  We always stay at the Bellagio  our fav  Upon our last visit  I noticed the customer service had really declined  Everything else  Cyprus Suite  Michael Mina  Olives  was spot on  but limo service  which I paid for had serious problems  Biggest issue no resolution to things easily fixed  Other things like housekeeping believing my room was a lounge  things missing from room that should have been there  I could go on and on and on  but it would take to long This visit was much improved  Lakeside Penthouse suite  I highly recommend it  provided you hit the sale rates  which I did  Le Cirque is still one of the best French restaurants I have eaten in  I recommend seabass over braised leeks  Michael Mina Joseph Phelps winemaker dinner  superb  For you wine nuts  Insigna wine is spectular  Please attend the wine dinners  they are fabulous  Olives good for lunch  Most improved  having Executive Suite lounge and checkin  Bellagio has caught up to Skylofts and Wynn Tower Suites ABOUT TIME  Limo  however still never showed up  but they comped dinners  so I will survive  All in all much better than the last stay  Almost as good as the  st  Lastly  eat at Mesa Grill  Frankly  Bobby Flay seems jerky to me  but he makes damn fine food and drinks  
N =>   Not what i thought   stars would be    But they fixed it  husband and i checked into the Bellagio at       am on a sunday  We didn t think the room would be ready yet  but she found us one  she asked if we wanted a king or   queens   we said whatever has the better view  she said that a fountain view room would be an extra     per nite  Oh well  then she said if you don t mind a low floor she could put us in our room now  we said cool  reminded her of our need for a fridge for my insulin  She said she would send that right up  so we went to check out room     on the   th floor  not too far from the elevator but the walk from the lobby was LONG    Even worse later when i was pulling my suitcase from the parking garadge to our room   so the room was lovely    kingbed and nice linens  the room also had a desk and chair and a big armoire with the tv and the mini bar and bar accessories  it also had a nice size table and two comfy chairs  the bathroom was nice all marble  seperate tub and shower  two sinks and toilet  all in the same room nothing seperated  two robes were hanging in the closet  the safe was very narrow  and would only hold a mini laptop  my camera was too wide to fit in there  we had a view of paris and ballys and The FOUNTAINS too  we were so excited   soon the housekeeping staff brought up the fridge and plugged it in and set it for us  dh tipped him and we took off for the spring preserve when we came back later someone had taken our fridge    after a long run around we finally got a fridge back  now i could put my meds away  so not off to a great start That nite went to bed and we were woken around   am to an eeeepppp  eeeeppppp  at the moment we thought it was an alarm in a nearby room going off   found some earplugs  thank god  and went back to sleep  i could still faintly hear it but it was better than nothing   so the next night we go to bed and the same thing happend  it was      am and there it was  so i went wall to wall in our room with my ear against the wall trying to find the direction the noise was comming from   it was construction outside   well we couldn t sleep after that  we think the maid threw away the earplugs  so we tossed and turned until our alarm was to go off  we needed to check out and get to the airport  when i went to check out i made it a point of letting the girl know that we had a few problems   with the fridge disapearing   with the construction noises  etc    she appologized profusely and took one nite off our bill  i was thankful for any kind of compinsation  I thanked her very much  but i don t know if i would stay there again  i didn t see   stars  But if i found another great deal i would probably take it   i think  
N =>   The good and the bad  Stayed at the Bellagio for    days third time in Las Vegas second time at the Bellagio  What can I say about the Bellagio bright spacious and clean  Room was fine but again how much time do you spend in your room  Buffet was up to its usual standards plenty of choice only problem was the queues Caf  Bellagio bit disappointed this time had one meal and it was not great   watch the Beef in consomm  with vegetables   no taste Pool was very busy but there were plenty of beds and towels for everyone  Pool service was good if you want a good spot get down early  Much like anywhere else beds were reserved by people who did not show up but at least here the staff went round freeing up the beds Now to the downside  thought the reception staff in general were poor on check  in  the male receptionist looked us up and down as if he had trodden on something  Did not talk about the hotel  mention anything it s just as well we knew where we were going Also night before we were ready to check out  checked the bill  and found that their were errors  went to reception and stood for about    minutes in the queues  Now I know what it s like to be interrogated after some discussion she did take off the errors but made the point that she would be checking into this  I know that they will probably have customers trying to scam them but should they not give people first the benefit of the doubt In general we enjoyed our our stay but I feel that this will be the last time that we stay in the Bellagio the general malaise about the place customer service is away down in their priorities  a huge difference in the last time we stayed  We felt then that we were wanted and special not just a number in a room Next year we will stay in the Wynn or the Encore or the Venetian Palazzio where customer is still king  
N => 	Star Hotel   Star Service We stayed at the Bellagio for   nights and we were really looking forward to it  We bought the vacation through an air hotel package on the MGM Mirage Vacation website and was perfect  We asked for   beds  non smoking and the lady at the front desk was kind enough to give us smoking so we had to change  after speaking with many  to a different room  Another problem we encountered was that the light from the phone  messages  did not turn off all night after having talked to operators all day long The hotel was good  but the casino is probably not the best in town  In terms of service  the people in the front desk were not very helpful when it came to asking about different services  they kept pointing us one direction or the other The staff is from everywhere in the world and the Buffet is very good and varied  the service though at the buffet is horrible  They don t care if you are comfortable or not  they only want to fit you in there  Making it uncomfortable to see which one is your server and who to ask in case of any questions  
N =>   Not the   Star experience I hoped for Checked in at midnight  Check in clerk barely offered a welcome and gave us an occupied room on the opposite end of hotel away from everything  Upon return to front desk to correct  I was told I had to wait in the check in line AGAIN now over   parties long for each of only   available clerks  After reaching the front of the line  we waited another    minutes and were told we would be comped breakfast and given a larger room   because it was handicap accessible  It was on the side of the hotel where everything could be easliy reached  It did not however have the   queen size beds which I paid for  nor were the amenities such as towels set up for the  rd person in the room which I also paid for  The bathroom plumbing leaked and an adjustable make up mirror hung broken off the wall  The light sources were a combination of low watt recessed lights and desk lamps  Only   of   worked and only   was fixed after I called the front desk    of the   beds was a plush comfortable motion bed  but the second looked and felt like a sofabed matress  I should have demanded another room  but by now my family guests were out cold from exhaustion and I couldn t bear to uproot them again  The entire pool area closed at   p m  leaving no quiet outdoor area available to relax in The lunch buffet started pulling food items off    minutes before ending to begin set up for dinner and left empty  I was embarrassed as this weekend trip was a gift to my aunt and cousin to celebrate their birthdays  I made the day manager aware of my experience upon check out and was comped   days of internet service        That was a nice gesture  however certainly not worth the disappointing experience  I would have been entirely happy had I just received what I paid for The grounds were amazing and the dancing fountains should not be missed  While the concierge desk was useless in offering directions or suggestions  the front entrance personnel on the taxi stand and bell desk were exceptional  It seems that any of positive experiences I had while staying here could have been enjoyed by anyone who was staying at another hotel and just came to the Bellagio to check it out  
N =>   Everything I had hoped for I was never  turnd on  by the bright lights of Las Vegas but I decided that before kids come along I had better give it a go and travelled direct with Virgin The Bellagio I must admit held high expectations in my eyes and I knew it would be hard to match my expectations       it did and some We arrived and the lobby was out of control  there were people everywhere but when it was our turn to check in the reception team acted as if we were the only people in the lobby and we were talked to as if we were a person and not an irritant that needed to be dealt with as quickly as possible  The guy was friendly  informative and interactive with us and more than anything     he had a personality  The rooms  even though we only booked a standard room  were clean and spacious  the bathrooms the same and having the shower cubicle seperate from the bath as a standard was pleasing As always the minibar was overpriced but welcomed      The restaurants that we tried were good  the breakfast buffet had everything you could want and if hungry and greedy you will ahve the best time ever  We also tried FIX restaurant which was great  the service  food and wine were perfect Not much else to say  the casino was as all others but the croupiers were much less chatty than at other places  also less inclined to help you by giving advice      as you can guess I was a novice  Oh and the fountains were superb  In summary   class  genuine and top class hotel  
N =>   Las Vegas Del Friscos s was fabulous   although I was really looking forward to crab legs they were served cold   I am used to eating them hot  The Bellagio Spa was fabulous and enjoyed the hot tubs and steeam room  the facial I got left a little bit to be desired  I have had better ones here at home  
N =>   Ideal location for first timer and   oh   the fountains    Booked the Bellgio simply because of the Oceans    connection  So much choice on the Strip  that s what it comes down to  Amazing place  Virtually faultless    mins to check in  Upgraded to a fountain view room with a smile  Got to our room on the   th floor  Perfect view of fountains and Eiffel Tower  Large modern room  no flatscreen TV   a slight disappointment   and no British channels   Floor to ceiling windows  Turned TV on to Channel    and immediately saw that it is IMPERATIVE to stay in a fountain view room in this hotel  Absolutely stunning As I said  the room was large  and the bathroom was large  Large deep bath and separate large walk in shower  Plenty of provisions   shampoo  conditioner  body lotion  cotton buds  shower cap  sewing kit  soap  But shower gel bubbles in short supply   only one bottle provided for the whole stay  Towels were OK  On the whole they were fluffy but not that big  Plenty provided though   we had three each The mini bar was HUGE  Nothing mini about it     for a coke  not too bad  Other provisions were way over priced  Slightly cheaper vending machine  and free ice up the corridor  Ice bucket provided  Biggest disappointment was lack of tea and coffee but we had brought our own kettle The carpet and fittings are very slightly tired but the cleaning was impeccable  and they came twice a day  leaving smooth jazz on the TV and some chocolates in the evening  Housekeeping is available virtually whenever you want it  Whether we left our room early or late we always had it cleaned at least once  There was a lot of clattering in the corridors from about  am so not great if you want a lay in  OK for us as we were on UK time and up at about      every day  amazing view of sunrise from our special window  We ate in the hotel twice  both times in the buffet  The breakfast was amazing  and so was the dinner buffet  However we both agreed that the atmosphere was not the best ever   it has a slight canteen feel to it   but the food was very good indeed and so much choice  No beans or cooked tomatoes for breakfast though which we thought slightly odd Throughout the hotel the service was impeccable  Everyone greeted us  everyone wanted to help  I had slightly surly service from the business centre but nothing to write home about I think there are two big draws for this hotel  First  the fountains  Viewed from the street or from the room  they are stunning and have to be seen to be believed  Second  the location  Bang in the middle of the strip  virtually everything is walkable  Take comfortable shoes  Everywhere takes a while to get to  We would have been disappointed if we had been at the MGM end or the TI end  Centre strip was best  we felt  Hopefully one day we will be back  This hotel has given us some very special memories  
N =>  Highlight of our trip  We stayed at Bellagio in the last week of ober  We had fantastic service and a fantastic room  I cannot rave about Bellagio enough  O by Cirque was fantastic and so was the Spa  
N =>  Watch out for the hidden charges A beautiful  navigable  excellent hotel  But please note that when you give your credit card   upon checkin  the hotel will put a hold on between          per day from your account  They call this  authorization   and while they don t charge you per se  you are not allowed access to these funds  We used a prepaid credit card  which we use for vacations only  and were surprised when the balance on the card was      less than we d thought   if we d have known they would  authorize  this money  we would have given them an alternative card  I tried to complain to management but was not called back  I ve since written a letter and am awaiting a response  
N =>  Outstanding    Stayed             to attend coference at Bally s   nd stay  Booked  quot Escape To Relaxation quot  promotion  deeper discount if booked early  through hotel website  Upgraded to Deluxe Lakeview  requested non smoking and   queen beds  Arrived after midnight  so only king bed available  even though requested   queens   Was told to call or return to front desk at     am that day to see if available  When called around      am  still unavailable  told to try again at  pm  At this point  just decided to keep room since it was conveniently located  near elevator  and colleague was okay with sharing king size bed  Wanted to spend spare time outside of conference gambling rather than trying to obtain room that was requested  All staff encountered throughout stay were very courteous and professional from housekeeping to restaurant servers to registration to casino staff  Very nice to hear staff addressing you by name on phone  Hotel immaculate and clean  Pool and fountains not operational on             due to high winds  Only drawback is that room had connecting door and I don t know if it was because there was a connecting door or if it is the wall between rooms itself  but I could hear muffled conversation from room next door  but it wasn t loud enough to disturb sleep   Also since door slams shut  you can hear when people enter exit room next door  Overall  great resort  great people  great location  Will most certainly stay again  
N =>  Great Stay right on the Vegas Strip We stayed here for one night during a road trip  We found a good deal online on the Bellagio website  Everything was perfect and very luxurious  My only complaint would be the trek from the car to the room  The lobby is rather far from the elevators  They like for you to have to go through the casino as often as possible  This didn t pose a problem for us  but if you or any one in your party has problems getting around  this might not be the best choice for you  Although  if you contacted the hotel directly  they might be able to make some arrangements  The hotel was immaculate as was the room  We stayed in a basic king on the west wing  The hotel is right on the strip in the middle of lots of action  Staff was very friendly  not snobbish  Good things are free parking and free valet  plus tips  of course   If you want to gamble  it s just an elevator ride away  They have several pools as well  They also have many restaurants on site  pricey  mind you   They also have a full service spa and salon  although we didn t have time to schedule any services  We will stay again  if we can in fact get a good deal    We did have to pay about     day for internet  Just a note  
N =>  Flawless in every way   Stunning Experience We arrived on   th ober after a fairly stressful    hour journey from Ireland  We got out of our taxi and were greeted warmly by the Concierge who offered to take our bags Check in was super quick and we were in our room within   minutes of getting out of the taxi The walk to the room is on a pathway which divides the casino   and you get a real feel for Vegas walking to your room  We stayed in Room        a Lakeview Room overlooking the Fountains The room was spacious  clean  elegant and well maintained  Facilities within the room were good   TV  Mini Bar  Internet  Lighting  Curtains etc  all worked well Bathroom had a huge shower and separate bath   loads of space  Shower was powerful We found staff to be knowledgeable and courteous in all areas of the hotel and casino We ate in Cafe Bellagio and the Bellagio Buffet during our stay Cafe Bellagio has a queue for breakfast but is only short  The Buffet we used for Lunch and noted that if you get there before      pm then you won t have to queue   great value at     each Check out was super easy   as we had registered our credit card with the hotel at check in  we were able to check out on our television and drop the keys off at the bottom of the lift  How easy  Will save up again so we can stay here on our next visit OTHER VEGAS THINGSCasinosBellagio   Great Drinks ServicePlanet Hollywood   The Pleasure Pit  after  pm  is worth a visitBallys   Older casino but good poker roomParis   well worth a walk from Ballys to ParisShowsLove at the Mirage   STUNNING show  A must seeZumanity   Rubbish  pure drivelPeepshow   Again  utterly terriblePhantom of the Opera   great special effects but musically not as impressive as Broadway or West EndComdey Pet Theatre   really good fun if you like animalsThe Rat Pack   Very good singers  set in the old style  OK ToursSundance Helicopters   Picnic Trip to Grand Canyon   AMAZING trip  Quick way to see Canyon   picked up at  am and back in hotel room at     am Concierge in Bellagio wil arrange all of these for you but some require advance booking  
N =>   Fabulous This was a fabulous hotel in every way  Room ansd service was outstanding  Teh buffett was also fabuous  
N =>   happy time visit I went to this hotel with my husband on a business trip  Though we had booked this with expedia or orbitz  I forget which one  the hotel went above and beyond to help us out when we left early to return home  as our first grandchild had been born earlier than we thought  They went out of their way to help us  as we were worried that they would charge us for the extra days that we booked  even though we had no clue that the little one would choose to come earlier than anticipated  They didn t charge us for the extra day or so that we had booked with them  The cafe in the Bellagio is awesome and we always have to return to go there everytiime that we go to Las Vegas   We love their iced tea  as the ice is made out of the tea and makes it much tastier  especially on a hot day   The food is excellent and reasonably price  with very hospitable waiters  The changing floral arrangements are something that you can t ever pass up at the Bellagio  along with seeing all of the colorful chandeliers in their lobby  The water shows are simply marvelous and draw a crowd each time  My favorite song they play is  quot It s Time to Say Goodbye  quot  Great place to stay  The bathroom and showers are simply beautiful   
N =>   Beautiful Hotel But No Service If You re  Just a Hotel Guest  We stayed at the Bellagio last weekend and had a nice time in Vegas  The hotel is elegant and very beautiful  The rooms were small  but nicely decorated and the bathrooms were well done  The view of the strip and the fountain from the room was great  The hotel  as well as our room  was immaculate  Though we did not spend significant time there  we thought the pool area was gorgeous  As a hotel guest  this would be the main  and only  benefit you get by being a hotel guest at the Bellagio   the pool is stunning  The restaurants at the Bellagio are phenomenal  We loved Le Cirque and thought the staff there was exceptional  We left our wine choice to the sommelier and he brought us a perfect bottle of wine for our meal  We also ate at Yellowtail  outside on the balcony overlooking the fountain  The food was delicious and the staff recommendations were spot on  We were highly disappointed  however  with the general hotel staff and concierge service during our stay  From the moment of our check in we were told if we had any questions other than about the hotel  we would need to stand in a very long line at the concierge desk  We did wait  but that s not the way you want to start your trip  When we did finally get up to the concierge desk  we had a few general requests for help with transportation and tickets  We were told that because we were  quot just hotel guests quot  and not casino guests  our requests could not be accommodated  When we called again for help arranging transportation  at our cost   we were given the same line     quot we can only help casino guests quot  not merely  quot regular hotel guests quot   While we re completely familiar with special services for high rollers  amp  have no problem with that  the way we were treated was shocking    it honestly made us feel terrible and low class  which is not the way you expect to feel or be treated at a   star hotel  By way of background  we have traveled extensively and are happy travelers not complainers  I think this may be the first time I ve actually voiced a complaint about service to a hotel  On the whole  the Bellagio is very beautiful  amp  the food is great  but you can access everything in the hotel without being a hotel guest  Even though it s a beautiful place  we will likely not stay here again   we enjoyed the service provided to us as  quot just hotel guests quot  at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay and the Wynn better  
N =>   Dream Vegas Holiday We had a somewhat rocky start to our stay in Las Vegas   one bag was detained in LAX for  quot security screening quot  and they managed to smash all but one of the shot glasses I had gotten engraved to give out to as party of a gift for my wedding guests  We stayed the first   nights at the Monte Carlo and the customer service was somewhat lacking  The Casio area had no atmosphere and the food court area was getting refurbished  We then moved to the Bellagio for the remainder of our stay as we were getting  uary      Due to our finances we stayed in   different room types  We stayed firstly in a partial lake view room which when we first walked in we were incredibly impressed with the size and the facilities  The view of the lake was also pretty good depsite it being over to the side and back a bit The second room we stayed in was the Bellagio Suite as we got married that day in the chapels and the suite was AMAZING  The decor was a little bit dated but still exuded enough luxury to make it feel perfect for the purpose of entertaining our guests with drinks after the ceremony before proceeding down to JASMINE for the reception The last night we were meant to stay in a  quot car park quot  view room but were upgraded to a full lake view room which was an awesome way to end the wedding week We ate at JASMINE for the reception and the food was to die for  Our cake was made by JPP and it had to be the best cake I ve ever eaten  slightly biased as it was my wedding cake   We also ate at the Japanese Noodle restaurant  can t remember the name   and it was also really good food and service Lastly we also got to see  quot O quot  and it had to be one of the best shows I ve seen in a while Our stay and experience was everything I would expect of a holiday to Vegas which was being done in style  
N =>   excellent stayed here for the second year running once again the hotel was superb as a base to explore vegas the hotel is clean staff are very welcoming check in took a matter of minutes despite the reception area being very busy restaurants in the bellagio tend to be very busy and quite expensive but there are hundreds more to choose from around vegas this year we had a  quot sunset mountain view quot  room which was  to be fair  once you looked past the motorway the room was massive and cleaned twice daily last year we had a pool view room  which again was lovely but this year a new hotel has been built alongside the bellagio  and that tends to spoil the view the bellagio is not as gimmicky as other hotels and this adds to its charm 
N =>   Excellent but expensive My twenty something kids and I stayed at the Bellagio for three nights  I booked the trip on line through one of the famous travel sites and got a great deal so I was not concerned about the room price  The rooms were excellent though they did not have a view  From check in to check out every worker we met was pleasant and helpful  The buffet was excellent  The only thing we did not like that there was not a bar or club that sold reasonably priced drinks and had low cover for the kids to go to so we had to walk or take a cab to get where they felt more comfortable  The location  though  is excellent and great places are within walking distance  When I go back with the kids I would stay somewhere else but if I wa going with a significant other I would definitely stay here  
N =>   Bellagio  Nice yes   But not five star fabulous My partner and I felt that if we are going to Vegas we are going to go all out     Star hotel  room overlooking the fountains  maybe some room service and a nice relaxing dip in the pool  what we thought would be the most luxurious   nights of our life Walking into the lobby it looked beautiful but didnt destract us from the long wait to check in followed by the long walk through the casino to get to our room  We stayed in the lake view room  great view of the fountains and the Paris hotel  The room although neat  was very dated   eg  TV was an old rear projection tv  The lack of cable TV channels was disappointing but the king size bed was nice and cosy  The marble bathroom was fairly generous in size and having the shower seperate from the bath was great and having digital scales was a welcome addition to the room    In comparision to other rooms the bath tub was small  The area around the sink wasnt enough for two people  the sink taps leaked and the drain made odd noises at night The room service menu was lacking in selection  pricing was average  Acess to high speed internet was available but it cost        US a day  House keeping kept the room beautiful and came in twice a day  It was a nice touch walking into your room of an evening having the bed ready to jump into  relaxing music playing and a dinner mint for each guest on the bed side table  The Spa was located on on the opposite of the hotel   a long walk from the guest rooms  I found the prices to be a little over the top for what was on offer  The Gym was a amazing to look at  once you find it    Plenty of work out machines and access to personal trainers BUT it was also located on the opposite side of the hotel from the guest rooms and it cost     US  each day  for guests to use it   I was shocked that guests had to pay to use the gym since all other hotels offered gym use for free  A long walk seemed to be a trend with the Bellagio as I went to find the pool located once again away from the guest rooms and was only open  am  pm  Although the pool area looked nice it was crammed with day lounges so walking to the pool was an adventure  There were a few pools but none of them seemed big enough to cater for the amount of guests The concierge helped out nicely in getting tickets for  O  but the wait at the desk was more painful than it need to be  There were four people present  but only one helping people  The casino was nice but didnt offer anything different from any other casino on the strip   and there were a lot less penny slots Car parking for guests was free for self parking but it was difficult to find a park and Valet parking always seemed to have a line  Car parks were located a long walk away from guests rooms   once again opposite sides of the hotel Plenty of resturants to cater for dinner time but unless you ordered room service  breakfast or your morning coffee was at least a    minute trek from your room   Then a fair wait in line since there was only one small coffee shop open  Check out was quick if you had a credit card on file   if not it was back in line for you All in all I wouldnt say the Bellagio was an awful place to stay it just didnt feel like we were staying in a five star facility   I found other hotels to offer more services and to offer more things for free to guests  eg  Gym use   
N =>   you must stay here  The Bellagio was everything I expected and more  The staff were very friendly and the hotel itself was lovely  Our room was large  as was our marble bathroom  The hotel is right in the middle of the strip  so a perfect location   you would not believe how long it takes to walk past one hotel  Only one slight irritation was that we got woken up in our room on a few occasions by a glug glugging sound coming from the bathroom  However  this was not enough to put me off  I will definitely return  I wouldn t want to be disappointed if I went anywhere else  Also excellent value for money  
N =>   Bellagio isn t all that  For the money you pay for this hotel  you expect it to be perfect The room looks nice  just don t look too close  The sink still had toothpaste all around it  I cleaned it myself  There was hair pins on the shower floor  We had about   light bulbs out throughout  and called to get them replaced but no one ever showed up  Everything is so high priced  we spent most of our time at other hotels  I would say to pay less and stay somewhere else  Actually  other than seeing  quot O quot  at the Bellagio  the whole experience wasn t that great  and would have much rather spent the money to visit someplace else  This was our  nd trip to Vegas  our first time was fun  but the  nd time wasn t worth it  
N =>   Wonderful Hotel First time in Vegas and it was a happy trip because we stayed at the Bellagio  We were on honeymoon and the husband had splurged on a suite  The room was so comfortable and we were treated like Gods  Amazing view    bathrooms    tellies  It was bigger than my flat in London   The room facilities were amazing for us  I ll probably never stay in a better hotel room so I won t bore you with these details  Suffice to say  there is a big big casino in the Bellagio  so you are sharing the hotel and its leisure facilities with the        people who traipse through the place on a daily basis  But  as I ve been told  that is Vegas  The on site facilities are VERY expensive       for a bog standard  although massive  steak is a bit rich for my palate but you are paying to eat in one of the best places in Vegas  The bars and restaurants were always packed  so clearly no one minds the cost  The staff were superb  the service was the best I experienced during our entire trip around California  The Wi Fi wasn t free  not even in the suites and I thought this was a bit cheeky  We paid a good deal to stay here and had seen free Wi Fi advertised at     motels during our trip  I think they should offer this to their customers  If you need Wi Fi  be prepared for the     a day cost We ordered room service on our last night and this was the only downside  The food was no advertised and so much of the meal was inedible to one of us  due to allergies   When I rang to draw their attention to this  I was quite rudely dealt with  I left it    minutes  while I calmed down to be honest  and rang back to talk to the manager  This guy took the complaint much more seriously and things were sorted out  But I d had to get a bit hormonal  which is never nice  A pretty small issue to be honest  If you are going to Vegas  stay here  If you can stretch to a suite  book it  You get far too much for your money  you won t want to leave the room    
N =>   Not our cup of tea This review is from il       I write in my notebook then when I get a chance I post it to TAWe booked Encore for our   night stay in il    but received a   day comp from Bellagio We figured this would be a great time to check out the Bellagio  we had heard and read alot of good things about it   So called and booked two of the three nights il      th We checked in to Bellagio on Wed   th      easy breezy checkin  no problems at all  She told us to go to a promotions desk to get   free buffets included in comp offer  We were given room        I m not sure what tower but I know it was an old one  I believe West tower   We go up the elevators and as we get off I m noticing a musky old smell    I was thinking maybe the carpet was washed and still damp the smell disappeared as we walked down to our room The room was fine and clean      just looked dated  I did like the bathroom alot  and really liked Bellagios moisturizer   usually never use hotels because they are horrible    The view    well we were on a low floor facing the Rio  view of the roof top  but that was no biggie to us  I certainly wasn t expecting a great view anyway seeing the room was a free comp  To be honest with you we are probobly one of a few that really don t think the Bellagio fountains are that big of a deal  we think they are overrated   so that view wouldn t of effected our stay either way We played at the casino for several hours and did enjoy the casino  the selection of slots  I ordered a mojito and thought it was good  the Wynn Encore no longer serve these at the casino you need to get it at the bar  We didn t stay over on wednesday night but came back on thursday and spent the day and night there  We went to a promotion desk and a woman gave us two free buffet tickets and line passes  she asked us if we would like an alcohol beverage with it  which we declined  but I thought that was really nice of her  We did the dinner buffet  ok we are not buffet people but it was free and again heard lots of rave reviews about it so had to try it  To us is was just basic food nothing Fab     kinda like cafeteria food  The bed in the room was very comfortable good night sleep and the room extremely quiet  Room service was ok    the server was very friendly   We just ordered a turkey club to split  not that great  and each a bowl of gelato  the coffee gelato was sooo good though  I noticed something about Bellagio room service    they do not send up glasses of cold ice water with their orders like Encore and Wynn both do Next morning we have an appointment for a couples massage at      am  this was friday morning   They told us to be there a half hour early  So we trekked from our west room to the spa  I really disliked not being able to get on the elevator and hitting the spa button   Got there    minutes ahead of time     got off the elevator and there was hardly any room to stand there was so many people in line for workouts and treatments       took us exactly    minutes to get through the line  Then to the desk to collect slippers and locker key    she looked at her watch and was like we are running late  sorry no time for tour  you must get changed and I will bring you to the waiting area  So I changed very fast     and off to the overpacked waiting area and husband soon followed in  Therapists were coming out and calling names rather quickly  I felt like an assembly line  Moooooooooo came to mind My therapist was Anna  hubbies was Stacey  he really enjoyed his massage     mine however was the worst massage I ever had  Her techniques was definitely lacking    she was briskly rubbing  felt like she was going through fast sloppy motions to get it done  it really was horrible as her fingers constantly cracked  It was really annoying  not sure if it was more annoying because the massage was so awful  I was just thinking in my head      hurry up and be over  When it was over I was glad but extremely upset and stressed  I couldn t believe how bad it was  I mean come on how can a massage be horrible  well it was  We paid I over tipped hubbies therapist and under tipped mine  and I didn t care We got back to the room to change and I really was upset and hubby suggesting calling the Encore and booking a massage with them  So I called and booked a couples massage for saturday morning  I asked about the spa and if it would be overly packed  because I did not want to relive the crowd in the Bellagio spa  she said it was saturday morning and it might be very busy so I opted for a in room couples massage   The massage therapist I had the next day more then made up for fridays disaster  She also told me if for any reason I m uncomfortable with a masseuse to ask her to stop  I didn t want to be rude  and ruin husbands massage as well      but in the future if I ever run into that again I will definitely tell them to stop and not go through that again Overall Bellagio is a nice place  but it is really showing it s age  I m not crazy about the crowds that go there to see the fountains and conservatory  and other things  I like a more calm relaxing feel to a hotel and casino and Bellagio does not have it  We would be back to gamble but doubt we would stay there again  too many other nice places to stay  
N =>   Its good but was expecting better and very busy inside Its a great hotel  but was expecting more for a hotel with so many stars  service was some times great  other times average  getting breakfast every day was a nightmare Always very busy with tourists wandering around  To get from one part of the hotel to another had to walk miles When I go back to Vegas will choose to stay some where else next time either the Mandarin Oriental when it opens or the Wynn   Encore as they seemed more private  
N =>   Very good experience   A great hotel experience   Compared to the Venetian where we stayed days before  everything is a little upper class there  out of the room size  very nice  but more standard sized  Except tiny details  why there isn t general room light switch      again a keycard not working very well   it s tough to find something really negative  Dinner at Yellowtail  Japanese  with Fountain Show right outside was just great  We went to the  O  Cirque du Soleil show  a really great entertainment  We also requested some help from the concierge desk  already before going to LV  and their service was perfect  There are plenty of great hotels on the Strip  but I would certainly return to the Bellagio if I go again in LV  
N =>  Excellence  My husband and I decided to renew our wedding vows on our   th Anniversary  When we arrived at Bellagio we were greeted with a warm and welcoming smile  At reception the hotel staff were very friendly and quick  We checked into our room which was stunning  Beautiful bathroom and amenities  Later on the same day we went and saw the concierge about booking us into the Circo restaurant for us and our two friends  Nothing was a problem and he also organized a limousine for us to go to the Little Church of the West where we renewed our vows  Prior to our renewal my wedding dress had become a litle crushed from travelling from Australia  I rang the concierge and he also organized the housekeeping to get my dress pressed for our special day  On the night of our Anniversary we went to dinner at Circo with our friends and the service and food was impeccable  Later when we were walking through the casino we were complimented by alot of passer bys  We definitely would stay at Bellagio again as they made our Anniversary a very special one  
N =>   Nice stay very helpful staff in all areas  Stayed at the Bellagio for   nites for vacation  Unlike some posts  we did not have to wait to check in  However  when we got to the room  after what seemed like walking for miles thru the casino   it wasn t clean  The bathroom still had soap  etc  in the shower  the toiletries the hotel provides had been opened and the room hadn t been vacuumed or properly cleaned  We complained and initially were told housekeeping would be sent up  but we balked at that  and were transferred to a new room with a view of the fountains  which was much better  Beds are comfy  the bathrooms are spacious and all in all  we were happy with our stay once we got checked in to the new  cleaned room  Strangely  tho  we did not receive new hand towels and washclothes on our last   days  and had to request them from housekeeping staff  But those two minor things are the only issues we have with our stay at the Bellagio  Other than that  we had a great stay  One thing I want to mention that we really thought was a great touch  and that is they have a staff person located at the elevators in the lobby  and they check to make sure you have a room key before allowing you to proceed to an elevator as a measure of security  I found that to be very comforting and appreciate the effort put forth by the Bellagio in that respect  A very nice touch  Wish more places would do that  Finally  we ate most times at the Cafe Bellagio  and had very nice  and huge   meals there  I would also like to commend the staff we encountered while there   everyone was EXTREMELY accommodating to any request we made and were very friendly   we really can t say enough about them  They helped us in any way they could and we really appreciated it  All in all  we had a very nice stay at the Bellagio  and we would definitely recommend it  
N =>   Welcome to the Fabulous Bellagio This was not our  st visit to Vegas  but it was our  st stay with Bellagio  There aren t enough adjectives to describe how great our experience was  From the moment we arrived and the bell captain helped us out of the car and retrieved our luggage  it was total excellence  The staff at check in  our house keeper  the concierge department  and all the wait staff we encountered were nothing short of wonderful  There was never anyone we met along the way that even had a hint of anything less than a welcoming smile  We were celebrating our   th anniversary and Bellagio helped make it even more special  We ordered a cake from Jean Phillippe bakery  it was absolutely to die for  We are now ruined for any other hotel  It will always be Bellagio  
N =>   Best Trip to Vegas I Have Had We flew in for one quick night  My daughter was having her   th Birthday and wanted to see the  quot O quot  show  We booked into the Penthouse Suite with a connecting room and it was SPECTACULAR    The Penthouse includes a limo ride to and from the airport and it was great to have a driver waiting for us when we entered baggage claim  Also included with the Penthouse is a private check in lounge so we did not wait in the long lines to check in or out  We also received at check in Line Passes for Taxi s and all restaurants so we did not wait anywhere we wanted to go  The VIP service Lounge made dinner reservations for us at Circa and we got VIP seating for  quot O quot   I can t complain about anything  The room we had was on the   rd Floor and faced the fountains  It was HUGE and had his and her separate bathrooms  The connecting room for my daughter and her friend was very nice as well  The Restaurant Circa was a real treat  It was expensive but we were there to indulge so we did not mind  My daughter had the best birthday  She loved  quot O quot  and got a Tiffany necklace from Daddy at the store inside the Bellagio the next morning  I would highly recommend this location and the Penthouse experience  We were there in a Sunday evening and the price was not as high as I expected       considering all the perks   it was worth it  I can honestly say  I am looking forward to going back to Vegas    not something I would have said before this specific trip  We are certain to stay at Bellagio again  
N =>   Bellagio was OK A group of   of us went to Vegas  It was my    Mom and Aunt and my sister and I  We stayed at Bellagio  We booked early and got a room for     night  The room was OK  Nothing over the top  The hotel is big  It takes forever to walk to your room or go out  Ate breakfast at the hotel every morning  The service was so so  The food was good but very over priced  There was no coffee maker in the room  Unbelievable  We bought a small coffee maker and packed it up and brought it home with us  Ate at the buffet one night  It was good  Big selection  There was a long wait to get in when we left  Hotel check in was very slow  Definitely did not have enough staff working Overall  Bellagio was a good deal at     night  but I would not pay rack rates for the hotel  You d be better off booking a suite at an older hotel  
N =>   Super Next to perfect     minute line up to check in  after that   perfection  I don t know how anyone can rate it less than    People that complain about the prices of   star resorts are more concerned with money than worth  
N =>   Maginificent Hotel This was a memorable experience staying in Bellagio in Lasvegas  We got a great room with a veiw in around   th floor  The room was very elegant and especially i liked the Bathroom  It was goegeous  The room was very comfy  We had a great time staying in this hotel and will stay again when i visit next time Oh one more thing  The breakfast Buffet is a sure thing you dont want to miss  This has a very vast selection of food varities than other places in Vegas  Enjoy  
N => 	star accommodation and reception service at the Bellagio   I think not  We booked a non smoking room in ust and were advised there were only smoking rooms available upon check in in ober  Once in our stale smoke scented room we found stains on our pillows  either from cigarettes or blood  and pillows of different shapes and shades of cream brown on the bed  The room itself was ordinary   more like a   star old style hotel room  After calling front desk twice to explain our disappointment at the standard of the room and asking if we could pay for an upgrade into a different room  it was finally the housekeeping inspection staff who changed our room for us  apparently there was now a smoke free room available   This change occurred     hours after check in  There was no follow up from reception concierge staff once we had changed room Check in and Check out was appalling for a   diamond star hotel    no service what so ever  Both gentleman we dealt with clearly didn t want to be there  were arrogant and did not ask us any of the usual questions such as  quot we hope you enjoy your stay quot  or  quot do you have any questions quot  or  quot did you enjoy your stay quot  or  quot have a safe onward journey quot  or  quot thank you for choosing the Bellagio quot   If they looked us in the eye that might have been a start It s like herding cattle through at this place  I d recommend staying at somewhere that has a fresh feel such as the Wynn or even   year old Planet Hollywood   where you have a view of the Bellagio fountains anyway Bellagio can be commended on their food  amp  beverage service standards and that s about it  For two Australian s that have never had to complain about anywhere we ve stayed at  I can say the hotel we were sure would impress us  completely fell short  
N =>   Bellagio is still a wonderful hotel Only one comment  They need to upgrade to flat panel TVs in all rooms  
N =>  Convenient but flithy  Although the Bellagio has a convenient location on the strip  I would not choose to stay there again  Our room had crushed beer bottles and used condoms that remained in the corners throughout our trip  almost    days    The bed SHEETS had some disgusting stains  that were probably a mixture between glitter  chocolate  coffee  blood  and other body fluid  To add insult to injury  our bill was over    more than our original quote  we only discovered this rate hike when receiving our bill on the last day  When you re staying at a hotel like the Bellagio that is already expensive     can make a significant difference  
N =>  Nice   But I would stay elsewhere Was traveling on honeymoon  tried to get an upgrade through the front desk by slipping some money    didnt work  all we got was a  quot line pass quot  to skip to the front of the buffet line   what a joke  When we got up to our room   light bulbs we burnt out in the bathroom  I also expected being the Bellagio a nice lcd tv    no luck  just and tube tv  The casino was nice  Loved the casino  
N =>  good but pricey I was underwhelmed by this hotel considering the price that we paid  The location is excellent and the staff is helpful but the room itself was average  The fountains out front are a treat but viewing does not require a say here  
N =>  Bellagio good not great we have stayed there in the past and always thought it to be the  quot class quot  of the strip  it seems to have faded a bit back towards mediocrity  still amongst the best tho  
N =>  Great hotel  The Bellagio was absolutely beautiful  We spent the days by the pool which was wonderful and the spa was excellent  Very classy hotel  Would definiately recomment  
N =>  Another great stay at the Bellagio  This was our  rd stay at the Bellagio and again it was spectacular  We were there for a convention at one of the other area hotels and was happy we d decided to stay at the Bellagio instead of the host hotel  The service was flawless  from the pool to the restaurants  The drinks at Caramel were good and strong  maybe a little too strong judging from the hangover   and their staff was helpful in suggesting new drinks  amp  wines Our bellman went out of his way to be pleasant  helpful and attentive  Although we were in a standard room  we were made to feel like VIP s  The maid service was excellent and we loved the nightly turn down service The only negative of this property is much the same as any other Vegas hotel   so huge that it takes forever to get to the pool or the lobby  Otherwise  we would absolutely not hesitate to recommend the Bellagio for either personal or business travel  
N =>  Food is fantastic gambling is all about luck I guess rooms are superb with cruise ship style attention to your room  After staying at Ceasar s Palace last year  I wanted to see if this could top it  As far as luxury  value  and fun place to be  The Bellagio blew Ceasar s Palace away in every facet except one  no topless pool  My room was fantastic  but not as modernized as CP  I think I actually had a tube TV  Bathroom was luxurious in an Italian way  The view was great  right over the pool  The food was the best in Vegas  even at the Buffet   Socialization was difficult  we did meet some nice couples at the pool but as a single person I also like to meet women as well  I met a young lady playing craps that wanted to see my room but I did not take her up on her offer  Also if you would like good drinks while you play even the nickel machines have great service  better than paying    to    at the bar  There are many rich men with entourages of young women handling out thousands of dollars to lose  I guess if you prefer a more social atmosphere Mirage does it for me  
N =>  Never Again    NEVER AGAIN    Nor will I recommend this hotel to a client From the moment we checked in  it went downhill from there  The service upon check in was horrible  We dragged  rolled and carried our luggage miles from the parking structure to the lobby to be treated as though we were part of a cattle call  We barely had our luggage in the door of the room  door wasn t even shut and there was a housekeeper asking if we had towels  I wouldn t know haven t been in the bathroom yet   I guess I should have dropped my bags to check as later I found we had no washcloth s or hand towels  ooops  Our bathroom door squeeked so loud I bet the entire wing could hear it  in the middle of the night our sink pipes started bubbling and creaking   Had to close the drain  close the bathroom door and put in ear plugs to be able to sleep  not only that  two lights in the bathroom were burned out  I just don t understand the lack of service in what was once a beautiful hotel  Beware  The in room internet fees are        for a    hour period  There is no quick place to grab a light breakfast  I wanted to use the gym only to find there is a daily     fee  unless I wanted to book an overpriced spa treatment then the gym fee is waived We were booked into the hotel for   nights  I was then made aware that MGM Mirage was considering selling either Bellagio or Mirage due to financial issues and Steve Wynn was interested in buying Bellagio back  Please MGM MIrage  sell it back NOW  Bellagio would then be a great hotel once again  Staying onenight at the hotel was one night to many so  we checked out and made our way back to the hotel where we stayed the previous night  life was then good for the remaining   nights  See my review on the Embassy Suites Convention Center  
N =>  Great buffet nice view Enough has been said   Just a single advice if you have lakeview  Make sure to tune the music on your television during the fountain show     
N =>  What a   star hotel should be but fell down on a couple of details Big room but I felt I paid for it and didn t get what I expected We got a deal on a basic room which was an excellent rate  When we arrived I asked how much an upgrade would be  I was told it would be     per night   I took it  Now the whole time we were talking the receptionist was watching my partners wallet like a hawk   I think  and I could be wrong  but the expectation is that you tip your way up the floors  So the  quot upgrade quot  we got was not much to speak of   a rear view of the I      wowie  not    In addition I was not told that the     upgrade was on top of paying a top up of the deal rate   I m still annoyed about that little stinger The room itself  ignoring the not so good view  was beautiful  large  clean  plush   everything you d expect of a   star  The huge bathroom with the whirl pool was lovely and the toiletries plentiful One thing we really needed as we are booking ahead as we travel was wifi  Now we have had great wifi in the most basic of motels but the Bellagio   don t rely on it  It s the only place we have had to pay        per day and the connection was terrible  It took the network support guys   hours to provide an ethernet cable  and I was charged twice for the pleasure of not using it  They did remove the charges when I explained that we had not been able to use it  This shows that the service is tops but it did annoy a little that the front desk hadn t sorted before our check out Frankly  you have high expectations for a hotel of this caliber but delivery can fail due to the physical size of the place  I also recommend using the self park   it is very easy  
N =>  lakeview rooms well worth the money i have just returned from getting married in the Bellagio  seperate review  whilst there we upgraded to a lakeview room which was absolutely amazing the views were fantastic and the room itself spacious clean and very comfortable the staff cannot do enough for you and housekeeping was done at least twice a day i would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bit of luxury whilst in vegas 
N =>  What a View from this classy central Hotel We stayed in room       which is a central high lake and strip view   and what a view it was   it was the icing on the cake on this top hotel  the pool area was good abeit the sunbeds are so close to each other   we went to the Buffet one night and we waited   hour   as a guest i was not happy as a large proporation of the queue was people visiting the hotel  i went to a member of staff to ask if the hotel guests had a fast pass but i was told no   met a family from Vietnam now staying in Colorado in the queue in front of us and they said they heard that the Bellagio was the number   buffet in the Usa   they said so when in Rome    rome     they were not wrong it was well worth the wait   food was fantastic  the price also included soft drinks and refills and coffee   The Casino albeit I am not a gambler must have been the most proffesional in Vegas    so classy     Over all the Vegas Trip from Scotland was well worth the long haul fight    would go back and would want the same room   hope you enjoy it      
N =>  Brilliant Hotel We stayed at the Bellagio for two nights during our trip to Vegas this tember  We had a fountain view king room on    th floor  We had amazing views of the fountains and paris hotel  Eifel Tower   The room was everything we had hoped it would be  Luxurious  clean  spacious and special The Bellagio as a hotel is also really good   The pools were great  the buffet amazing  we ate breakfast and dinner there  its as good as everyone says   and the rest of the hotel just brilliant and classy We also saw O which was amazing but booked in advance   Would definatley advise to do this as its sold out most nights Not the cheapest option for staying in Vegas  especially food and drink   With the other hotels such as Excalibur still really good at a lot less I m not sure we would stay again but glad we ve experienced it  
N =>   Never Again My husband and I thought the beautiful Bellagio would be the perfect place to spend our first wedding anniversay   boy were we wrong  This negative memory is still so strong that   years after our trip and I am taking the opportunity to write this review  After waiting forever to check in standing in a smoke filled lobby  we were told that the fountain facing room we were promised was not available  The room we were placed in was nice enough  but not when a stranger opened the door and turned the lights on sometime in the morning  Thank goodness I had secured the lock so the intruder could not gain full access  When I told the front desk of this event they thought nothing of it  We had arranged for a spa day which also was a disappointing experience  Our massage therapists did not really listen to what we wanted and I ended up feeling like someone had just put lotion on me with no massage involved  and my husband ended up feeling like he had a deep tissue massage  which is not exactly relaxing  We finished up our spa day in separate hot tubs and I was not happy to see cracked and missing grout  With such a high end spa and hotel I would have never expected this  My husband has been involved in sports his whole life  his father was a football coach  he was a football coach and his son is a football coach  My husband s comments when he emerged from the spa shower was that he never dried off which such a rough towel  For someone who has seen a lot of locker rooms  that said enough Although we did have some great food at the hotel  it was very  very expensive  There also didn t ever seem to be any quiet place at all where we could simply enjoy each other s company and relax enough to celebrate a year of marriage A terrible experience and a terrible way to remember our first anniversary  I wish we would have stayed home  
N =>   Great place does it matter what I say   tripadvisor is a joke  only posts what they want travelers to believe  no realism at all  so don t base your trips on what they allow to be printed  no realism to it at all 
N =>   Viva Las Vegas My wife and I stayed here for one night as we paid a flying visit to Las Vegas  The hotel is everything you d expect from Las Vegas  with an extravagant lobby  expensive shopping and lavish restaurants  We took the opportunity to have a walk through the casino and dine at the  Prime  steakhouse in the complex  The food was excellent but expensive so it really was a treat more than anything else  We couldn t stay for breakfast in the morning so can t really comment on the quality of it but the fact that we were given a voucher to get to the front of the queue when we checked in would seem to indicate it s very busy  We did try to grab a coffee from the coffee shop but it was queued outside the door so we decided not to bother On check in we were offered an upgrade from the standard room we had booked to one of the famous suites for       as compared to the      it should have cost  so we decided to take it since we were only staying for one night  When we got to the room it was very lavish  with a living area  dining room  bedroom  bar  bathroom and a second wc  It was very well finished  clean and had all the usual creature comforts  However it didn t have the view of the fountains that we had requested for our original room so we ended up asking to be moved back to what we had booked The room we got was still excellent  It had a modern finish with a king size bed which was very comfortable and a large bathroom  again clean  The TV had plenty of channels including one that played the music being used for the fountains  of which we had an excellent view along with a good section of the strip  They really were the highlight of the stay as they are spectacular both during the day and at night The only criticism I have was that the shape of the safe in the room was a bit strange so some larger items wouldn t really fit into it      all in all a minor detail  It s also worth noting that when the check in staff warn you that the mini bar is very sensitive and that you shouldn t lift anything unless you intend to eat or drink it they re not joking  We  accidentally  lifted a packet of cashew nuts that cost         Fortunately we didn t have to pay for them when we checked out I would definitely recommend a stay in the Bellagio but get the view of the fountains otherwise you could be staying in any hotel in the world  
N =>   A ROOM WITH A VIEW My wife and i stayed here in august for   nights after staying at the MGM for   nights prior Check in was a breeze  we were up graded to a strip fountain view without even asking   i know  why does that happen to everyone else      we got to our room around      am and it was ready  all mod cons as you would expect  i half expected the room to look dated and in need of a re furb after some of the reviews i have read  but it was top notch  The bed was amazing  the view was better    we have been to Vegas    times but we still found it hard to pull ourselves away from the window and that view     the bathroom was great with plenty of fresh towels  Housekeeping were awesome and if they came before we had left the room you simply contacted them and they came to clean it when it was convenient We thought the pool area is the best we have been to with PLENTY of loungers in the sun or the shade with lots of different pools   great pool staff also   People have commented about waiting for lifts   we very rarely had to wait long   how long it takes to navigate the casino   very quick  amp  easy   so relax and enjoy it To sum up  go  you won t be disappointed   depends what you pay i guess   and don t worry about negative reviews  We stopped at the Encore in ch and could not decide which is better  different things for different reasons i suppose Would i recommend it  hell yeah        
N =>   Magnificent   across the board I had high expectations for the Bellagio as I ve wanted to stay there for years  All of my expectations were not only met  but exceeded  We upgraded our room to a junior suite when we arrived for an additional     a night  We were also lucky enough to get a room with a lake view  Everything about the room was perfect  The location was perfect  and the pool was beautiful  The only minor negative was the price of all the food in the hotel  but we knew about this going in so we just accepted it  The breakfast buffet was actually reasonably priced  and it was excellent  I d definitely recommend hitting this up at least once if you stay at Bellagio  
N =>   celebrating my daughter s   th and my grand daughters s   th This is a badly run hotel   We made several phone calls and emails to confirm adjoining rooms but it took us    minutes at check in and a change of rooms to obtain this  We were charged   extra deposits but after several phone calls got this rectified  Champagne and other extras were ordered for my daughter by her husband for her arrival    it took her sister   visits to  quot stand in line quot  at the concierge desk plus   phone calls to receive this special gift at    pm  the birthday girl had checked in at noon but one of many excuses was that  quot room changes were not allowed quot There is relatively no information in the room so we tried the tour desk   she was totally ineffectivie and gave us the wrong information Our room was not clean   evening room service is a joke Our most positive experience was the poolside breakfast  friendly efficient staff It s too bad you have to walk so far  through the casino to the room elevators from check in check out  The lobby seems better than most hotels   smell  but I would suggest the Wynn over this 
N =>  Bellagio Staff Don t know who wrote those reviews concerning rudeness I read before my stay at Bellagio this week  I was there four nights and have nothing but the highest praise for the kind  friendly service from all members of the staff from check in  to the restaurants  to room service  to maids  to the Spa  to everywhere Keep smiling and maybe too you will enjoy this great hotel  
N =>   Bellagio Hotel    stunning but take your ear plugs Just returned from a ten night stay at the Bellagio Hotel in LasVegas  Stunning hotel  at a great price from Expedia    and having been to Vegas before and stayed at the Egyptian themed Luxor  decided to go for the Bellagio given it s location smack bang in the middle of the strip  The exterior of the hotel gives it an Italian themed look and we certainly were impressed when we stepped inside  We had a room over looking the pool area  not willing to cough up the extra    dollars a night just to overlook the fountains  I m mean they are free to watch from the street area    but given that the pools were all lit up at night  it gave a nice romantic view out the huge picture window in our room  Excellent service by housekeeping and regular  quot turn down quot  service with comp chocs on the pillow  Good casino but never actually ate in the hotel itself as it was  quot Bellagio quot  priced aka  quot expensive quot  Now for the down side  I have never ever stayed in such a noisy hotel  The main problem being that the sound proofing within the bedrooms was pants  Not only could you hear you next door neighbour cough dry their hair pee or in our case hear their V LOUD mexican soap opera they favoured but you could also hear every footstep to conversation that went on within the hallway  And as our hallway was an inveitable Charlie and the Chocolate factory esque never ending number  this could be rather irritating  With the casino being open      the traffic was frequent and often accompanied by drunken singing or dismay at having paid out big bucks on the slots  My second complaint is that the doors to the rooms were swing type which would naturally shut without being pulled  this resulted in EVERYONE allowing their door to slam shut     and our room then to judder like a dodgy set type from a bad movie  My last complaint is a minor one but it well got on my wick  After one particularly hot day at the pool I retreated to our room to have a wee lie down in the air con  I put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and attempted to get some kip  I was woken from my slumber by housekeeping on the phone asking if a wanted new towels  They had decided to phone as they saw the do not disturb sign       The mind boggle as to it was ok to obey the sign and not knock at the door but phoning would be fine and not disturb me  I said no to the towels in a strangled voice  All in all these may sound like minor niggles but I can assure you after ten nights of constant noise  you would be feeling rattled by it to     to the point we were trying to shout at the mexian woman through the wall to turn down her beeping tv  she turned it up    I m not saying dont stay in this magnificent hotel  just take your ear plugs with you   
N =>   Magic   nd time   the Bellagio  Great service great place Booked a Lake view room superb Check in a breeze as was check out Fail to understand the negative reviews about long lines etc Still up there with the best in Vegas      Looking forward to our next trip  
N =>   Serenity on the strip Loved the Bellagio  not just because they upgraded us to the Penthouse Room with more bathrooms than guests  Particularly loved the views over the dancing Fountains with soundtrack on the TV  It was great to lie in the bath and watch another television The pool area was really lovely   made you forget you were in the middle of Las Vegas and felt more like a nice resort somewhere in Italy  Shame you needed to walk through the public areas to get there The buffet was great with tremendous choice and obviously very popular  The gaming tables were not so  in your face  as in other hotels in Vegas and the shops were pleasant and did not evoke the feeling of being ripped off that was apparent in other hotels  Could have happily stayed there longer without going outside All in all  if you have to be in Vegas  this is the place to stay  
N =>   Great Views   but  ordinary  room We stayed two nights at the Bellagio         amp             Hotel is beautiful  personnel are great  The room itself was very clean   but  we did expect more opulence  We were upgraded to a fountain view room  using the     sandwich technique I read about on the Las Vegas forum    Everywhere you go in this hotel requires a trip through the casino      The pool is so far away from anywhere that it wasn t worth the trip   that was a disappointment  We ate at Prime and were terribly disappointed  We always share meals wherever we go   have had plentiful portions at fine restaurants in Willaimsburg  VA  Maui  Kona  Chicago  etc  But  here  the portions were laughable  We spent over      for a minuscule salad  approximately   bites each  and a portion of tuna steak that would require a magnifying glass to see   approximately   bites each and   tiny pieces of asparagus on each plate   The meal included   glass of wine each  We really should have just said  quot you ve GOT to be kidding quot  and left   but  sadly  we stayed  Even though we share meals   we tip generously  This waiter didn t deserve the generous tip we left   we did not receive service with a smile   We hope he was just having a bad day and that this is not typical The next evening we ate a splendid meal for a fraction of the cost of the previous evening  also shared and served with a smile  at the Venetian  We would recommend staying and eating here to anyone planning a trip to Vegas The Venetian Hotel DID NOT HAVE A WEIRD SMELL as one person mentioned on this site  the reason we did not stay there   I would not recommend the Bellagio simply because of our treatment at the Prime restaurant   and that is sad  But  the ambiance at the Venetian was just more our style  We have no real complaints about the Bellagio  It just didn t feel as  warm  and  inviting  to us as the Venetian  
N =>   Excellent hotel beautiful suite free upgrade  We decided to splurge and have a night in a salone suite whilst in Vegas  We arrived early at check in and got served immediately  On check in we were informed that we had been upgraded for free to a bellagio suite with foutain view  Couldn t fault the service  Our room was immaculate if a little dated  they are in the process of redecorating the suites as the online photo is a little more modern than ours was  We were on the   st floor with a brilliant strip and lake view  Maid service came twice daily with a nightly turndown service  Tv s in room played fountain music  We ordered a breakfast room service which although we were told would take half an hour arrived in    minutes  There was no noise in the rooms  didn t see or hear any other guests on our floor  Unfortunately as we were only in the Bellagio for one night we didn t have much time to truly appreciate the suite  The pool was lovely and in short walking distance from the elevators  Fontana bar gave excellent fountain views  drink was usual vegas prices  cocktail menu was a little fancy but the one I tried was delicious  Check out was also fast and easy with only a very short wait in line I d highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting something a little more classy than your average hotel  
N =>   Viva Las Vegas Our stay at the Bellagio was wonderful  I would not stay anywhere else  The room  the staff  the pool and everything else was top notch  
N =>   Next time we ll save money and go to the real Bellagio Italy  Went here for a girls trip with one of my best friends  We wanted a luxurious  relaxing trip and were super excited for the spa  In sum   everything is very  very expensive  Knew that going in but still   I think we could have flown to Bellagio  Italy for less  No joke  Huge  heavily trafficked  over the top  In the end  we realized we re just not Vegas people Roomed about the   th floor  view of the fountain which was fun Lovely lobby but you still get the cigarette smoke from the casino  We d walk all the way around the back side of the hotel to avoid walking through  Stinky  Feels so un luxurious  Quite a nice long walk that way  Spa  Pedicures were nothing special  I pay     down the street from where I live and get a better foot massage exfoliation  Facials were nicely done  but still ridiculously priced  My friend loved her massage  Mine was awful   new massage school grad  I think  Basic Swedish massage strokes  Nothing special  Poured coconut milk and oil on me that was warm when it hit my skin but after   seconds turned cold  Felt like he was dragging a cold  wet washcloth across my skin  I was freezing  Covered with goosebumps  Shivering by the time it was over  Certainly not luxurious or close to worth the price  Spa facilities are lovely  Great soaking pools sauna steam room  Lovely meditation room  Yummy french onion soup with room service Took a long time to check in  but faster than other Vegas hotels on the strip  Very nice concierge service where we were able to charge our phones overnight  I recommend it if you re into the Vegas scene and style and can justify the cost  But what the heck were we thinking going to Vegas for health and relaxation   
N =>   Very nice but not worth the money This is our forth time to Las Vegas and for our anniversary decided to splurge on the Bellagio When we arrived  the room we booked  king bed  non smoking  was not available and we were offered a smoking room or a room with a queen bed  I was very rudely told that the room you book is not guaranteed and we could pay for an upgrade if we didn t like those options  So  I paid an additional     per night to upgrade to a suite  When I arrived in the suite  the TV didn t work  the safe didn t work  and one of the lights was burned out  On top of that  the suite was at the back with a view of the parking garage  Honestly  I expect more for this price On a positive note  the housekeep  concierge and maintenance staff was excellent  The room was clean and hotel beautiful  I will not be back to this hotel  There are far better hotels in Las Vegas for this kind of money  
N =>   Was glad I got a discounted rate I was here in tember with several friends to celebrate my   th birthday  I found the hotel to be wonderful  I was glad that I was able to get a deal on the rooms  I think everyone paid below the full rate for the room The room was dark  but  so were the last places I stayed in Vegas  so  I m starting to think that is just Vegas   o  Concierge was very nice  Check in was wonderful  They tried the best that they could to move us close to the others in our group The bed was so comfortable  The bathroom was huge  nice soaking tub  lighted magnifying mirror  large shower  The service was great  I think that they cleaned the room twice a day  Or  once a day and then came back for turn down service The pool was great  but  the drinks there are expensive      per drink  Our party stopped at a CVS and bought some liquor  We brought our own mixed drinks down and saved quite a bit of money  I don t think there was a  quot bad quot  place to sit at any of the pools  You have so many options throughout the different pools We ate one night at Noodles  which was delicious  Pretty standard Asian fare  but  it was enjoyable  We also ate at Yellowtail  I highly recommend the pop rock sushi  It was quite interesting  The next time I go to Vegas  even if I don t stay at the Bellagio  I d return just for the sushi   o The only negative     the hotel is starting to get    a bit old   o  There were chips in the paint on the doors leading out to the pool  Ditto with some of the bathrooms  Our bathroom had a leaky faucet  The TV in our room was a bit out of date  All in all  the hotel was beautiful and amazingly maintained  But   I think the hotel is    or    years old   o  Some of the wear is starting to show  If I could get a deal again  I wold definitely return  
N =>   Best hotel on the strip I have to say I was highly impressed with the Bellagio  I have stayed in a few other hotels on the strip including Ceasars  and I would choose Bellagio first  We were staying their for my sister in law s   th birthday party  When we checked in we emphasized this fact to the desk  and they made sure to get us close to birthday girls room  We ended up one floor below them  which was fine  The rooms were fantastic  The   Beds and the   arm chairs in the room were very comfortable  We did think they could use a bit more lighting in the room  but we were happy overall  The bathroom was great  we were very impressed with the shower  and the huge tub  We did have   lightbulbs out when we checked in  maintence came up and fixed them within    minutes of our call to the front desk  Our room was nice an cold when we first walked in  which was nice coming from the heat outside  The one complaint we had was when we first arrived to our room there were dirty glasses sitting outside our door  We had to call   times over a    hour time period to have them removed  The   pools were great  plenty of room to lay out and enjoy the sun  The cafe by the pool was delicious  I would eat there again in a heartbeat  The conserge was very nice and helpful giving us advise on what shows we should see from the list we had come up with  She made the ticket booking part as easy as could be  The lobby is unbelievable  along with the conservatory  and the chocolate fountain behind the conservatory  I will be staying here again in the future  
N =>   Fabulous hotel but lacking the personal touch HiCelebrated my   th birthday here with my husband and had a fantastic time  Took a champagne helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon to mark the occasion  which was magical  My husband organised a cake and balloons for the room   best cake decorations ever  Apparently he tried to arrange this before we left as he wanted the balloons and flowers in the room for arrival but he was informed they couldn t do it until after we arrived Everything about the hotel is wonderful from the chocolate fountains to the botanical gardens  The casino was great and you must go to the Gourmet Buffet held on a weekend   it was brilliant and such great value The staff was always pleasant and professional  the rooms were as you would expect of any   Star hotel and location is excellent   although I hadn t realised it was such a long walk from one hotel to another  Get a taxi to the ones that are further away   I felt a bit guilty sometimes getting a taxi to somwhere that was only about a mile away but save your feet for the shopping The fountains at the hotel were amazing   I was expecting them to be a bit dull but they were absolutely magical We did visit most of the other hotels and had dinner at the Wynn  I preferred the Bellagio The below is not a complaint   just an observation  It may seem strange to even note these as they are unimportant factors in deciding on your hotel On arriving at the hotel  there were   or   guys in uniform outside and it struck me as really strange that no one offered help with our luggage   no problem  we could manage it ourselves but that s what happens throughout the rest of the world so I expected it We were then a little disorientated  didn t realise the taxi had dropped us off at the casino entrance   which is at the back of the hotel  and we hadn t a clue which direction to go in  massive place  and there s no signs  So we went back outside to ask the guys They were all really polite and pointed us to reception   again  you would think at a hotel of this calibre  someone would have escorted us to it   or walked with us for part of the way  Remember this is a massive hotel and it s not easy to get your bearings Check in was efficient but again  we were given a map and told how to make our own way to the room with our luggage   a grand old distance away There were no doormen on the main door   again  I m capable of opening a door  and anyway I have a husband to do this   but it s absence is noticable  Should this put you off visiting  Absolutely not  but if you re used to really great service from top class hotels  you will notice too  It s more of a norm now that after such a long journey  you re greeted with a cold towel  an iced drink and someone to whisk you off to your room  
N =>   Not what I expected I just returned from a four night stay at the Bellagio and I would not return  There were    of us here to celebrate my   th birthday  When making reservations the rest in our group requested to be by our party  None of us were close to each other  Not even on the same floor  Two other rooms were even in different towers  As the lobby and casino are beautiful the rooms are average  Thankfully we got a great deal or I would really be upset  Our room had one chair for the four of us  The refrigerator that we requested when making reservation and when checking in didn t arrive until the following day  There were stacks of throw pillows that I assumed were suppose to go on the bed but wouldn t know because house keeping never once made up the bed with them  Just left them in the corners of the room where they had been when we checked in  One day we actually had to call house keeping because the never restocked the wash cloths  hand towels or bath towels  Also the curtains on the beds could not had been dusted in a long time The room was very dark with only a couple overhead lights  Our air conditioning was set at the lowest possible setting and we all were still sweating  The only thing good about this room was the bathroom  It was very spacious and had a big shower with great water pressure The pool was fabulous  There were four pools and plenty of chairs  The bartenders were great  The drinks expensive but that was to be expected The little cafe deli on the way to the pool was excellent  I highly recommend the pizza fresco and the caprese kabobs  YUM  Ate breakfast at Cafe Bellagio and was sat in a timely matter even with the line and it being Sunday morning  But stick with water  my orange juice was        Ordered a baked potato and chicken noodle soup through room service and had to call back after an hour and fifteen minutes to ask where it was  Noodles was so fabulous we ate there twice  But again  pretty pricey  Lunch buffet was our last meal and wish we would have ate there more  It was delicous with a wide variety  Everything from fresh sushi  leg of lamb  antipasto  and chilled shrimp to sliders and chicken noodle soup  And only       I will definetly be going back to the buffet when I return to Vegas in ember  
N =>   Be careful what you charge and check your credit card bills Recently stayed here  Fab location  very nice hotel wonderful entrance  fountains etc  However  the room was not that clean   the curtains were dirty and the carpets could have done with a clean  it must have been incredible when it first opened  I think the rooms are a bit tired  My partner had a tray of drinks spilt over him and although they did their best to rectify the situation  it appears to be a nightmare when we came home  They compensated us for the clothing and took our small bar bill out of the amount they owed us  but for some reason the Bellagio accounts dept does not seem to want to accept this and keeps charging us for our drinks bill that we have already paid  They have been rude to us and considering how polite we were about the situation  I am amazed at how they are treating us  we are only talking about a small amount of money  We did not create a huge scene  but they have not treated us very nicely  We keep having things show up on our credit card and then recharged   three times this has happened  Check what you charge to your room and check your bills  
N =>   Excellent  We stayed here for   nights in ember      when we went to Vegas to get married and it was great  Luxurious and comfy room  all the staff were great  food was excellent  pools were lovely  Spotless everywhere we went  Particularily enjoyed having breakfast served in the room and enjoying cocktails in the jacuzzi outside  I cannot fault the place  
N =>  Absolutely Fabulous My adult son and I have just returned from a five night stay at Bellagio  We had a fabulous time  Restaurants in Hotel are expensive  We ate at Cheescake Factory in Ceasars Palace next door  They have a wonderful menu at affordable prices We would certainly go back to Bellagio for it s elegance We also booked four nights and got an extra night free  
N =>   Didn t quite live up to expectations Our group of three has just returned from a five night stay at the Bellagio in celebration of my sister s   th birthday  Despite contacting the hotel in advance to make them aware that it was a special occasion  no effort was made to recognise this or suggest ways in which to mark the event  Whilst the hotel is ideally located in the centre of the strip  offers a fantastic water fountain show  amazing pool area and courteous staff  some   there s little else that impressed us about the place  After two nights chilling in LA  our arrival at the Bellagio could only be compared to a combination of a major rail station during the holiday season and a shopping mall during sale time  I expected busy  but not hordes of people constantly traipsing through the common areas  As a previous reviewer mentioned  you CAN hear people passing outside of your room if they speak in more than a whisper  The triple room we d booked turned out to be a glorified twin   I thought king size beds were standard in luxury US hotels NOT double   and the best reception could do when we checked in was offer a king and a roll away bedded room as an alternative   Apparently it wasn t clear that the three names booked into the room meant three people would be staying in it   As a previous reviewer mentioned the shower was slow to drain away  not good in a room occupied by three people and your the last one to use the shower   although  the maid service was prompt in providing additional towels and a robe for the room and constantly replenished toiletries  The rooms themselves although spacious  were quite dark and not helped by the dark furnishings or small  pool view window  I was shocked to discover that use of the gym facilities came at an additional cost of     a visit  Apparently  this is because it s not just a gym  but a  spa experience    I only wanted to do    minutes on the treadmill or cross trainer    Overall  a nice enough hotel but rather disappointingly not at all what I was expecting for all the pomp and circumstance that I d been lead to believe about the Bellagio  Having visited some of the other hotels on the strip  if I was to make a return visit  I would be more inclined to book a stay at the more contemporary Wynn or Encore  
N =>   Not that great  Upon arrival it seems the hotel is very nice  Nice staging  rooms are nice  but not great  Our shower did not drain at all     but we did not call and complain as we did not want to wait around for someone to come up and fix it   Also  four lights were out in our room making the room somewhat dark  If we had paid full price for this room  I would have been very disappointed  Something else to let you know  We checked out of our room through a very nice lady who strolls the lobby  She stated they would email the bill  We were ok with this since the only charge was our room and one drink  Not a big deal    Right   Well after getting my bill through email  I was astonished to see other charges on the account  Things such as chocolate trays  poker chips  drinks  etc  Then I noticed they started crediting our account for some of these items  In all charges for    items  NONE of which we had purchased  Then they credited us for all but three items  So I then proceeded to call and I was informed if we moved any item in the fridge or the snack trays in the room  there is a sensor on both of these  and it automatically charges you for what you move    UNBELIEVABLE   So  yes  please watch what you touch in your room       And Yes  they did give me the other credits for the three items    I don t think we would stay there again  
N =>   Wedding at the Bellagio Bellagio Las VegasWe had our wedding planned for well over a year in the UK church   wedding reception  cars   flowers  photographer etc      so from my point of view   bloke   i just had to turn up and say i do     for reasons which i can t put on here plans changed My other girlfriend at the time now wife changed it so i went into oh my god mode and took the dog out for a walk when she sprung it on my as i walked through the door from work Anyway we had picked the Bellagio for our honeymoon  so My wife had looked into getting married there  considering it was such a nightmare over here in the UK calling and changing and planning it was absolute haven dealing via email and only had to make two calls to the states  the lady was so good she kept us up to date with all that we needed to do We arrived on the Wednesday  th y      and the morning after the hotel put a limousine on to take us to the marriage licence office next o the court  stayed there which was only for    minutes and took us to another hotel where friends and family was staying The reception when we first walked in was like being at Manchester international airport check in desks but a lot faster  my wife had been to Vegas   times before but it was my first time  to be honest i said when she first told me that she wanted Vegas as the honeymoon i was not that keen but after being there i really did not want to leave Right getting onto the hotel  breathtaking  amazing  stylish    star      It is like no other place the rooms where as big as small apartments  the bath was as deep as hell  shower pure fun Staff fast and very polite there was nothing that we asked they could not get  whatever time day or night the hotel and town never sleeps  the fountains are the best thing in Vegas  the play there show every    minutes  beautiful at night We had our wedding meal at a place in the Bellagio called Olives that was the best ever and the service was second to none  the wedding chapel was so nice i just expected it to feel like a room in the hotel  they even played it live on the hotel website so family and friends in the UK could watch as they did and loved it  the photographer was the best and the photo s have come out very good  he knew his stuff and we have the fountains going off with bright blue sky behind Anyone wanting to get married there feel free to get in touch and i will get the better half to explain all the girlie stuff to you The only thing i would say is don t go in y  i love the sun but we hit a heat wave and it was     one day  We are going back next ober on our own this time  
N =>   Great hotel disorderly services We stayed at Bellagio during the last week of       for some R  amp  R  Lets start with what we really liked We had the Bellagio Suite  I highly recommend it  It was on a high floor  nice views  but not the strip  We got a room in the back of the hotel  which was OK  The ammenities in the room were wonderful  You can t beat the location too  While there we were able to see quot O quot  which was outstanding  We also had a chance to visit the spa for a massage  The facilities were nice and clean  The massage was good  I ll leave it at that  I ve had better Now for the things we didn t like The check in and the check out experience was terrible  Let me explain  When I booked the room on line it said that there was a special area to go to for guests who booked suites  We never found that room  so we checked in at the front desk  There was a mob of guests scattered all over the lobby  Most were waiting to either check in or out  but there were no lines  no banker ropes to tell anyone where to stand and who was next  When we told the front desk person about this issue she completely agreed and then turned to her manager who also agreed and said they have tried to relay this message to upper management without any success  Upper management needs to be put through the ridiculous check in and out experience  I would hope that after experiencing the caos in a hotel of this caliber they would reconsider making the check in out a bit more orderly  Otherwise they must have thier heads in the sand  literally  The restaurants and other eating places in the Bellagio had the same issue The staff at the restaurants had the same complaint about management  We even got yelled at by another customer at the cashier cage when trying to cash in a ticket  who actually cut in front of us and believed that they were next  There were no ropes setup to indicate where to stand Once we finally got to our room  some areas of the carpet were wet  After it dried we knew that the cleaning staff probably tried to clean it because it was stained  Again  I would have expected in a hotel of this distinction they would have replaced the carpet if the stain could not be removed  Just sloppy In addition if you decide to visit the Bellagio buffet  think twice and go somewhere else  The food was bland and tasteless  not what you would expect at Bellagio  In addition the cashier was anything but nice  more like miserable and not even a thank you  Again for     person its not worth it  Very disappointing experience Overall the experience was frustraing to deal with the lack of order at this hotel  which is not what you would expect of a hotel in this category  There are plenty of other hotels on the strip  but not sure they are any better  since most are run by MGM  My advice is to check Trip Advisor carefully before selecting a hotel on the strip  The room was a good deal  but not the services  
N =>  Why stay anywhere else in Vegas  Upon arrival at the Bellagio we parked at the very conveniently located car park and dragged our bags up to reception  Sadly      is a very popular check in time and we were kept waiting to check in for    minutes or so  When we eventually got to the counter the clerk apologised profusely and immediately upgraded us to a fabulous fountain view room on the   th floor   what service  From the very start the service at the Bellagio was perfect   from the room porters to the girls bringing you drinks at the tables  to the restaurant staff  The room itself was flawless   luxurious to a tee  and the hotel is more of a resort than mere hotel   there s so much going on  If you go you simply cannot miss  quot O quot    one of the most expensive shows I ve ever been to but absolutely worth it  
N =>  Phenomenal Stay My husband and I spent      to      This was my first time to Vegas and my husbands  rd time  The Bellagio was a first for both of us  We read this website religously for   months before we got there  Of course one could be hesitant when there are a few bad reviews mixed in  But having the experience ourselves  I am glad we proceeded with our plans  The Bellagio is beyond words  We got the penthouse suite with fountain view    th floor  We had executive lounge check in with little wait time  the bell man was very professional and expained the amenities of the room  Security was very reassuring  Yes  when you wanted to turn in early the fountains and street noise were a little distracting  but not if you turned in late  The room was wonderful  clean and we did not want to leave  We were very spoiled  The lap pool was very nice and we spent a small amount of time there  Very courteous bar staff come around ask if you would like a drink  We ate at Sensi one night and my husband had the crispy shrimp  He said that was the Best shrimp he had ever eaten  Joseph  our waiter was the most professional and knowledgable of his work  My huband took me to Prime for my birthday on the  nd  Fantastic   We walked thru all of the strip casinos and were amazed at the architecture  The Bellagio casino was a blast  Loved the penny slots   My husband has a special touch with those   We will most definitly stay at the Bellagio the next visit  
N =>  Service prior to arrival  Incredible       I wanted to make sure I completed this initial review on the service I received prior to even arriving at the Bellagio on tember  th  I spoke to Lisa when calling in for directions and parking location and then talked to Tim concerning information I needed on the Slot Tournament I was to play in on Tuesday and Wednesday  These   employees could not have been more helpful  nor more charming to talk to  Who ever does the hiring  must also get my  thumbs up  for hiring such pleasant  knowledgeable people  This experience prior to even arriving at the Hotel makes this trip something I am really excited about  Thank you so much and I look forward to my stay Kathy Laughlin  Nv  
N =>  Great Hotel We decided at a last minute to check out of another hotel on the strip and move to the Bellagio  The other one was awful Got a great rate   despite being the holiday weekend As you would expect the reception was busy but had to wait no longer than   mins to check in   Arrived at      am and was allowed to check in and get a room straight away in the Spa tower The staff and service here is impcableRoom was well furnished   cleanThe only downside i thought in the room was the lack of tea coffee facilitiesOn check out you have to collect bill from receiption which is a bit time consumingWouldn t hesitate on a re vsiti 
N =>   Wonderful Hotel    This was our first time to Las Vegas and we had heard so many wonderful things about the Bellagio we wanted to check it out for ourselves  It lived up to it s wonderful reputation   The staff was super accomodating  and the rooms were big  clean and the housekeepers came in at least twice a day to clean up  replace towels and ammenities  They also gave us an upgrade to a suite since we were staying with them for a week  nice perk  The pools were beautiful  smelled like lemon and eucalyptus all around  We rented a cabana and thought we died and went to heaven   it was pricey but worth it to us  Plenty of towels and lounge chairs to go around even if you don t do the cabana  The hotel is located in the middle of the strip  so it s easy to get to everything  We stayed in the spa tower  quieter than main hotel and we didn t have to walk throught the casino to get to our room  Of course we watched the fountains as often as possible  just beautiful  I would highly suggest staying here as your oasis in Vegas  
N =>   Nice but not the greatest We stayed at Bellagio for three days at the end of e in a deluxe lakeview room  We were on the   th floor with a beautiful view of the fountains  We never got tired of watching the show both in the afternoon and evening  We used the self parking strucure and had no problem getting a spot near to the entrance  Check in was a breeze as we were there mid week  The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was spacious  The individual closets with built in light was a nice touch  However  for the price you pay for a standard room  there are much better accomodations elsewhere  What makes this room worth the money is the view of the fountains We requested turn down service the first night and were dismayed to find they put the throw pillows on the floor  and they stayed there for the remainder of our stay   In addition  there were stains on the bedsheet  At least housekeeping changed the bedding the next day We ate at the buffet for dinner one night because many people say how wonderful it is  it wasn t  There were so many people  that trying to get your food and get back to your table without getting run over was a feat  For the price we paid  the quality of the food was not what we expected  However  their in room dining service was fantastic  From the service to the quality of the food  it was perhaps the best meal we had while there We checked out on Friday and it was a mess with so many people trying to check in for the  th of y weekend  While standing in line  they changed our line from check out to check in  The girl said we could still stay where we were  but it took almost    minutes to check out  Overall  the Bellagio was a nice hotel  but it would not be our first  or second  choice the next time we visit Las Vegas  
N =>   Worth the extra money We spent Christmas at this hotel and it was worth the little bit extra compared to Paris  Planet Hollywood  etc  The hotel is well situated on the strip for walking to almost all of the sights  The room is probably the best I ve ever experienced in terms of size  comfort and cleanliness  Be careful not to examine any of the items in or on top of the minibar because removing them  just to look at them and then put them back  electronically triggers a purchase and the cost is added to your account  We made the mistake of doing that and then wondered why our bill was charged for stuff from the minibar when we didn t consume them  A call to reception soon sorted it out and the items were removed from our account  The only thing which made me give this hotel   stars instead of   is that  although the rooms are non smoking  the casino and reception area are not  None of the casinos in Vegas are non smoking and I expect that this will continue to be the case for the forseeable future  Nevertheless  as a non smoker  the atmosphere within the smoking areas was quite bad  It s a good job that neither of us are avid gamblers so we were happy to stay away from those areas as much as possible  Although there s no free internet access  the business centre does allow you to use their PCs to print out boarding passes  Overall  the Bellagio is an excellent choice of hotels in Las Vegas  both for service  comfort and proximity to all the attractions  Finally  although THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BELLAGIO  I ll mention that  on reflection  we would not take the hotel shuttle from and to the ariport again  Our incoming shuttle driver proceeded to erect a sign in the bus more or less requiring passengers to provide him with a tip  We d rather not be coerced in this way and would prefer to make our own decision on whether or not the provided service warranted a tip  Morevover  the outbound shuttle was very late in arriving  despite being prearranged and confirmed the day before  The airport is so close to this hotel that  it s probably better just to take a cab  It s probably no more than a      min ride whereas the shuttle stops at several hotels enroute and takes much longer  
N =>   Did not want to leav I loved Vegas  I loved the Bellagio  The whole place is just like a giant adults playground  I was a little overwhelmed when I arrived  as I d come off a    hour flight and was tired and hot  The lobby of the Bellagio was packed and the check in experience just didn t feel like a five star experience  given the throngs of people  Got to the room  it was lovely  if dated  Actually  given the hotels reputation I was surprised at how dated the fixtures and fittings were  But the room was very big  bathroom was huge  No robes  no slippers  a little surprising again for a five star hotel  I know that sounds so high maintenance  am just trying to give you an idea of what you ll get for your money  Concierge service was fantastic  Friendly  helpful  all you could want  I was in love with the place by the time I left  You come into Bellagio and feel cocooned from the madness outside  Had dinner in Prime one night  divine  Steak was out of this world  waiters friendly  Security is good in the hotel  you can t get past the lifts without a door key  I felt safe and cosseted in the Bellagio  Gambling is expensive there  Fab location  near to everything  I loved the fountains  not even sure why   they just captivated me  every time they danced I stood mesmerised like a kid at disney world  Our room looked over the strip and I can t tell you how excited I felt every morning to see the strip  just waiting for me to go and have fun on it  Went to a club in Mandalay bay called The Function Room  I think   it was very good  well I got home at      a m  so that says it all  Friendly people  fun time  Also went to a place called the Fireside Lounge  well worth a late night visit for cocktails and food  it s like an old fashioned american diner  I was charmed by the place  Ate at the outside terrace bar at Planet Hollywood one night  revolting  do not waste your time or money there  It was disgusting  Went to see Barry Manilow  hilariously brilliant  Also went to see O  good but at      per ticket  I thought it was very expensive  I loved Vegas  I m not      sure why  I just did  I felt relaxed and happy  the sun shone  everyone was having fun  the city can cope with massive numbers  Go  it s FAB  
N =>   wonderful experience Stayed   nights at the Bellagio in the spa towers  From check in to check out  everything was great  did have to wait in line to check in at      pm as they did not have an invited guest line but it moved quickly  Room was large and well appointed  Comfortable bed  Large  luxurious bathroom with magnifying mirror  great toilettries  soaking tub  Turn down service each night  Enjoyed the restaurants and lounges  Pool was beautiful  No complaints whatsoever  
N =>   Everything you expect it to be    We stayed at the Bellagio for the first   nights of our honeymoon  Not having been to Vegas before it is somewhat overwhelming  We checked in  bit of a queue  then took the major hike to our room  We booked a lake view room as that seemed to be the whole point of going to the Bellagio really We got to our room and were really pleased  We were on the   th floor just off centre with a great view of the strip and the fountains We liked the room   it was spacious and clean and tidy  The bathroom was a good size too  The floor to ceiling window was great for watching the fountains and we pulled up a couple of chairs every night to sit and watch the world go by  at a hundred miles an hour   while we sipped a glass of wine The main hotel area was very plush  The casino felt a manageable size compared to some of the others  The pool area was huge  clean and very nice  You had to work hard to get a good chair with an umbrella if you weren t out there early but that s the same as anywhere I guess We at the breakfast buffet twice during our stay and really enjoyed it  The waiting staff were excellent and the selection of food was also excellent  We didn t use any other restaurants bars though  and I have to say I didn t want to   I found them a little stuffy Shops are lovely to look at but are way above anywhere I could ever go   if you want shopping in your hotel choose Caesars Palace which has more recognisable high street names  I found other hotels also had a more laidback dining drinks approach   we visited several of the hotels and I knew I would feel more comfortable eating and drinking at their bars as they seemed pretty chilled and not so  exclusive   Also   there isn t really anywhere for a quick bite  It s either a full sit down meal or a roll pastry in a coffee shop  Caesars and other places had food halls or cheaper restaurants that wouldn t break the bank Overall I am glad we stayed at the Bellagio but if I were to return to Vegas I would probably opt for Caesars  
N =>   Crowded but nice Stayed   night  following a   night stay   Red Rock for a conference  We arrived shortly before noon to a zoo like lobby  though there were several staff milling about trying to direct guests to the shortest lines  etc  On our first attempt   checking in we were told we could either have a king room or come back in     hours for the   queen beds we booked  We went  amp  had lunch in the Cafe  amp  walked around the Conservatory before coming back to check on the room status around       Heidi somehow managed to find a clean ready room for us on the   nd floor directly overlooking the lake  however  when we got to the floor  neither of the keys worked  A call to the front desk promised security would come straight up to let us in  amp  a bellman w new keys following right behind  however  to this day  I m still waiting for both  A housekeeper happened to wander by about    minutes later  amp  let us in  Considering this was a   bed room  it was interesting that there was only   set of towels in the bathroom we had to call for more along w a  nd suitcase stand  amp  a set of working room keys  The room itself was of good size  as was the bathroom  However  as is the case w the guest rooms   Red Rock  not a bit of ventilation in the bathroom itself so it would get quite stuffy very quickly  Also like Red Rock  the lone vent for the AC in the guest room is beside the window a ceiling fan would help circulate the air  especially towards the bathroom  Unlike Red Rock  both my cellphone  amp  laptop aircard worked fine in the guestroom  Once the water show started  we had a great view from our window  amp  enjoyed watching it off  amp  on all night  For dinner we went to the Buffet  my first  Vegas  buffet   for the price  I thought it was quite good  amp  would definately go back  
N =>   Rooms Not the Greatest for the    We stayed here     to the   th  When we first checked in  amp  saw our room we immediately went back to the front desk  amp  requested another room  The room was dark  amp  overlooked a concrete alley  For the kind of money they want for a room  it sure needs upgrading  in a big way  We stayed at the Wynn on Sat  amp  Sun  amp  Wynn is much nicer Bellagio does have all the pools  which the Wynn doesn t  But the rooms are better at the Wynn 
N =>   Dated We stayed at the Bellagio from ust  th    th  It was a special stay for us as we were getting married  The Lady on check in was miserable  we asked for complementary upgrade  she was stern and said no On entering the hotel it was huge and beautiful  once in the room is was old and dated  Yes you could tell it was classy but it is in need of a refurb  The room was also very dark at all times of the day  The hotel was beautiful and a lovely place to stay  though we had paid a lot of money to stay here  I am not slating the hotel in any way we really liked it though it was not worth the money we had paid for it When we go back to Vegas we will stay somewhere else  I love the Bellagio and looking around the shop and casino area is more appealing to me than staying in one of their rooms  I am glad were stayed there though next time it will be somewhere else for us  The location is great  especially for first timers  as you are central to everything  A lovely hotel  though like I say a bit dated  
N =>   Excellent location We stayed at the Bellagio as part of our honeymoon  We arrived there on a Monday lunchtime  and check in was really quick  The girl on check in was a bit miserable   it was our honeymoon and she didn t even say congratulations  In fact she didn t talk to us at all The rooms were a good size  maybe a little dated  but tastefully decorated on the whole  We had a lakeview room which was the highlight of our stay  and I d recommend paying the extra for this  We booked online using a discount code that someone had posted on the Vegas forum on tripadvisor and we got a great rate of      per night for a lakeview delux  so keep your eyes open for deals The bathrooms are big and the shower was powerful  There was a good vanity mirror in the bathroom Everything in the minibar was ridiculously overpriced and on a weight sensor so be careful if you go poking around The pools are lovely with plenty of parasols and sunbeds  We ate in the pool bar and cafe bellagio both of which were good  We had planned to eat at the buffet one morning but the queue was huge so we didn t bother  We had a drink in Caramel  but we thought it was overrated The public areas of the hotel were all well maintained and very clean  We loved the location of the Bellagio   it was great for a first time visit  In comparison to other hotels  we much prefered the Bellagio to the ott themed hotels  but I did think that the Wynn and Encore were nicer  
N =>   Great view and location After having had to change a tire in Death Valley and then spend an hour at the dollar car rental getting a new car  it s fair to say that we were very much looking forward to getting to our room and relaxing We drove up to front and quickly handed over our keys to the valet and our bags to the bellman to hasten our arrival at our room  Unfortunately check in seemed to take ages despite only a few people ahead of us in line  Why it takes this long  when everyone has already given all their details on booking I don t know   even with us not asking for any upgrades etc and simply wanting the room we booked it took a full   mins for us   This long wait was repeated the next day when i went to pick up a gift left with the concierge However once we  finally  got to our room  Lake view deluxe   all was forgotten as the views across the lake and over to the Paris Eiffel tower were amazing   pure Vegas  The room itself was great as well with special mention to the huge bathroom with double bath and huge shower  Amazing value for such a great room  we paid      a night   We rang for our bags to be brought up and almost instantly there was a knock on the door   remarking that this was a bit fast I opened the door to find some champagne had been sent up to us by some friends also in Vegas at that time   what a perfect  and much needed  present  Our bags came up shortly after and we wree left to enjoy our bottle of champagne and a long hot bath before heading down for some food and coktails  and a little gambling  Great rooms at a great price  but service is incredibly slow 
N =>   Fabulous view of fountains great pool  We booked a Lake View room  amp  became fountain junkies over the next   days  The view of the fountains set in time to the music that you can listen to on your tv was great  We are not really into gambling  amp  came to Vegas just to see what it was like  The hotel is like a small city  amp  you could quite happily never leave  However  the customer service was very average  the food was okay  amp  there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room  However the room was a good size  the bed very comfortable   amp  it was clean  amp  quiet  I loved the pool area with the fountains  amp  the gardens  
N =>   Worth the Price I had a great hotel experience at the Bellagio  I couldn t find anything wrong with the place           except the service  The staff was not the friendliest and the service at the restaurant was extremely slow  But the over all stay at the Bellagio was out of this world  I will definitely stay here next time  
N =>   It was Ok From ust    to ust    my husband and I traveled to Las Vegas  NV to the Bellagio hotel  The hotel itself was OK  Not the best I have ever stayed in  not the worse  Certainly not   star  be     to   star  The service was OK  Checking in was pure hell  It took us all of an hour to check in which we thought was ridiculous  We are yland residents but we flew into Vegas from Georgia  That plane ride was about   of the longest hours I have ever experienced  Who wants to wait a whole hour to check in after fighting with traveling literally all day  The room we had was equipped with a bar and snack bar  All of the items were certainly overprices  A bag of M  amp  m s were     That is crazy even for Vegas  The room appeared to be somewhat dated  and for some reason the room did not have any washcloths  The ironing board fell to pieces  lol  as soon as my husband pulled it out to iron prior to leaving out for dinner on the first night  Once we called for washcloths and a new ironing board the staff brought the items in a fair amount of time  I really enjoyed Vegas as a whole but the hotel was a hit or miss  The hotel did offer a wide array of nice shopping and gambling  I personally do not gamble   We did not eat at the hotel  The other annoying feature included a staff member at the entrance to the elevators that led up to the hotel rooms who wanted to see your room key every time you wanted to take the elevator up to the room  That means if your room key is in the bottom of your purse start digging  if you left your room key in the room because someone was there to open the door for you start calling them to bring the key down etc  I somewhat understand the safety patrol  However  just because you can flash them a room key does not mean you are legit  Overall it was OK  If you are looking for a decent place to stay while you party  gamble  and do what people in Vegas do I could recommend the hotel  If you are looking for something exquisite    star perfection you may not like this hotel  If you are looking to shop to you drop on high end label such as Jimmy Choo  Chanel  Gucci you have arrived  The hotel is located next to Caesars Palace which also has great shopping and really nice restaurants  Another good point of the Bellagio is that it is located in the middle of the strip  Not to far north or south  Great location in that sense 
N =>   Wonderful Stay at the Bellagio Stayed at Bellagio for a friend s birthday weekend    days actually  in early ust  Can t find anything negative to say about this beautiful hotel  The staff was very friendly and made us feel welcome  While we were out in the evening they came in and closed our drapes  turned our TV on to a smooth jazz station  left us chocolates and refurbished our towels  When we checked in we were given a room with a view of the construction area next door and requested a room with a pool view which they promptly found for us  The pool area was one of the most beautiful I ve ever seen  although you needed to get there close to when it opened to reserve a chair with umbrella   This is a very large property but is quite easy to learn your way around  Great location at center of The Strip  but you do have to walk across to Paris Bally to get a monorail   Not sure I can afford to stay there often but we were very lucky and had gotten a special rate of less than      a night  
N =>   Absolute Luxury We paid      a night on the hotel website and stayed   nights  Our first impression was it was so big  we d never find the check in  But after walking around and falling in love with the the hotel we were comfortable  The location was excellent for us to browse up and down the strip  The Patisserie was a favorite meeting place   we were drawn to the cakes and chocolate fountain  Our room overlooked the pool  It was a large room with our   large comfortable beds  The bathroom was huge   and I enjoyed the soak in the large tub  Would I stay here again  even though it was the largest hotel I d ever stayed in  You betcha  We also saw the  O  show  and that was just mindboggling  I d seen every Cirque de Soleil show that has come to my home town and  O  beats them all hands down  Thank you to the staff too     nothing was too much trouble from the parking staff  check in  maid service  casino  theatre  cafes and check out staff  You are a credit to the hotel and I look forward to a return visit  
N =>   Still a nice place but maybe time to move on Dates           two nights Who  me  amp  wife  my parents stayed at Caesars  Harrah s Diamond How  Bellagio summer promotion  three nights comped  only used two        f amp b      free play      O tickets  which we didn t use It was just past       a m  when we pulled up in the cab  All the windows at the front desk were for check out so we used the invited guest window  which we were   Surprisingly there was no attempt made to upsell us to a better room We went to the Player s Club to get our free play activated  We had a very difficult situation during our stay in late e  which I had been promised would be resolved  more on this in a moment   Unfortunately  the Player s Club had us keyed in  again  with the wrong offer  This time a phone call solved the problem  which is more than I can say about the e visit  see my previous Bellagio review for details  After the e incident I sent an email to Guest Services at Bellagio  A couple of days later I received a phone call from the Director of Slot keting  I think that is the title   He was very apologetic and asked me if I would have him sent to the Player s Club desk when I arrive in ust so that he could meet me  He also indicated that he wanted to do something special for the ust visit  When we got to the desk for the ust visit I asked for him by name  the manager called him and was sent straight to voice mail  I left him a message with my room number and Player s Club number  I never heard from him  and nothing special was offered us My wife and I had said that we were going to see how Bellagio responds to the e incident  we had already booked ust  before we decide if we were going to continue coming to Bellagio  We are now looking at Venetian Palazzo as our homebase I won t say much more about the visit because the hotel has been described to death in this forum  We were in the main tower on the   th  I think  floor in a decent room that will need to be renovated soon I d like to make a comment about the service in the rooms  When we went in e we never received turn down service yet on the ust stay we did  When the maid came to our room on Sunday morning she took my Sunday papers  LV  amp  LA   They were neatly stacked on the desk and looked as if they had just been purchased  I was able to track the maid down  she was at the end of the hall when I came up to the room  and she apologized profusely for lifting them and said that her trash bin had already been emptied  it had   I called the front desk and got no satisfaction  I spoke to an employee in the lobby and got the runaround  I finally found a guy near the bell desk who take down my name and room number and arranged to have the papers replaced Some other comments about service  we received excellent service from the waitresses at Petrossian and Baccarat bars  These are both gems and make Bellagio better than most hotel casinos  We also enjoyed breakfast at Cafe Bellagio but I m not sure it is worth the price  The second morning we had breakfast at ustus Cafe at Caesars and it was just as good but much cheaper  The service provided by the dealers at the craps table and the cocktail waitresses in the casino was also good Bought a nice purse for the wife at Dior  Those people are awfully stuffy until they see that you aren t just a looky loo   then they really turn on the charm  
N =>   Nice Stay Spoiled My wife and I were the benefactors of four free nights at Bellagio  lucky us   We have stayed there before  but during our last couple of stays we found the hotel a bit worn  perhaps due to the need to economize due to the economy  Not this time  Our room was perfect and well appointed  The one light bulb that had burned out was promptly replaced by staff  We asked for the Spa Tower and had to wait a couple of hours until a room was ready but that was a minor inconvenience  All of the staff we met were courteous and pleasant EXCEPT the women who guard the entrance to the Petrossian Bar  We have found during our previous stays that these women have attitude with a capital A  We wanted to reserve a table to celebrate the wedding anniversary of our friends  So  my wife went down to the bar a couple of hours prior to our time to meet our friends to make the arrangements  She asked to reserve a table at      p m  and promised the young woman at the front that we would order two bottles of expensive champaigne  hoping that would encourage a positive response  Hah  The response   quot We can t do that  quot  given in a tone and manner that suggested that my wife was less than dirt for asking  we have run into this attitude before from different women who guard the Petrossian entrance   Just down the way in the casino is the Baccarat Bar  My wife went down there and made the same request   quot Of course you can reserve a table  quot  was the response  When we all arrived the champaign was served by a pleasant young woman who went out of her way to make us feel welcome  But the moment was spoiled by the Harpies at Petrossian  Two bars  very close together  with totally different personalities  surely the same manager must run both  why the difference  We ve already booked our next Vegas trip at Wynn  where we have never had a service or attitude problem  
N =>   Bring your wallet    Hotel was pretty and nice but not a great value I stayed here with friends to celebrate their  th wedding anniversary  The hotel was nice  bed comfy  room spotless  but we had a view of the rooftop  We got a room rate special  about      night  and I just didn t feel like it was worth it  Most Vegas hotels are huge and personalized service unheard of unless you are a celebrity or gamble big bucks   the Bellagio was no exception  The lobby was overcrowded and we felt like cattle most of the time  A cup of coffee was    in the hotel restaurants  Food in the hotel was very good and well prepared  but wayyyyy overpriced  I felt nickled and dimed  I would have been exceptionally pleased if I paid          per night   but I didn t  The common areas and atrium were beautiful  but not worth the room rate  Nice place  just not a good value for the money  We ate at Chipotle near Harrahs the last night because we couldn t stand to put out another     per person meal  I won t be going back for a long time  The highlight was the spa   I paid     per day to work out  but since they comp d fruit  snacks and drinks in the spa  I felt like it was worth it  
N =>   be I Expected Too Much I have to say that this facility was really disappointing  We waited in line for    minutes to check in    only to be told that  inspite of our reservation  the non smoking rooms were gone  We accepted a smoking room which had a very bad odor  To the credit of the hotel  they fumigated the room and removed about     of the smell  The buffet was well priced but unexciting  The service was very poor  The casino was okay  nothing exciting  I have stayed at many Vegas Strip hotels which were better than Bellagio  
N =>   Great stay  First  I have to say I was so lucky to find a rate back in il for this hotel for     a night in a standard room  just by googling Bellagio discounts  Woo hoo  When we got to the hotel we were very impressed with the lobby and speedy check in  Our room was on the   th floor  overlooking the pool  It was great  especially for what we were paying  We found the room to be nice  amp  quiet during our stay and were never woken up by noisy neighbors The first night we ate at the buffet  were lucky enough to not have to wait  as there was a long line as we were leaving  it was good  not great  Service was wonderful  The casino had a good air filtration system  because the smoke didn t bother us too much  Thats one thing I hate about casinos  We also had lunch at Olives on the day we left to go back home  The food was good   again not great   but service was excellent and we sat outside so we got to see the fountains again before we went back home  Overall I would stay here again  although with the reviews I see about the Wynn and THE hotel I might try those also  Unless I could get a rate like I did on this trip  
N =>  First time we stayed here    now we don t to stay anywhere else  We travel to Vegas     times a year but this was our first time staying at the Bellagio and we absolutley loved it  The staff was great  the beds were very comfortable  our view was AWESOME and their pool area was beautiful  We tend to stay at the Mirage more than any other hotel on the strip but I think the Bellagio may be our new spot  
N =>  Wonderful experience Everything about our stay here was wonderful  The staff was pleasant and always available when we needed something  Our room was impecable  The entire hotel emits a feeling of class and grace  unlike anything else I ve ever experienced  We will definitely return  The cost of a stay here is a little more than the other hotels in Vegas  but well worth every penny  
N =>  great hotel Loved every minute we stayed here  th y weekend not the best time as streets were very busy   the Hotel was fabulous  our room       overlooked the dancing fountains which we never tired of watching   the room was very spacious and immaculately serviced every day  The staff were friendly at all times  We made use of the pool every morning even though it was crowded at times it was still pleasant   if you could not find a chair there was staff to look for you  nothing was to much trouble for them you can even go down early in the morning and reserve chairs there were plenty of eating places and were all of a great standard the only one we would not go to again was the all you can eat but if you like these types of meals it was good value There was nothing free here but that is typical of most Hotels of this standard we stayed in around the world there was only one porter who was a little sarcastic upon our departure and that was because we didn t tip him for putting our luggage in the Taxi remiss of us I guess but had already tipped one porter     for bringing our bags down from the room We will stay here again for sure it was central to the strip get a day pass on the Deuce this will take you to many hotels  The only other hotel I would stay in would be Wynn but that is a little more pricey Bellagio is not cheap but certainly I found it worth the money a little luxury was lovely for the end of our  mth holidayWe went to Cirque O fantastic and in the hotel  the casino is very nice although we didn t even put a cent in a machine we were to busy to stop  we used the spa even got my husband to have a pedicure with me they treated us royally  Congratulations to the Bellagio 
N =>  A by the numbers Vegas casino resort Really  there are only   contenders for  not stupid money  top end Vegas hotels   this and The Wynn  This has larger rooms for the price  All clean  well maintained  Usually you can get some decent special offers  Nothing really to write home about but a great place to stay with a group of friends doing Vegas or a partner doing shows etc  Casino is mainly     minimum tables from memory which gets expensive quickly   
N =>  Fantastic  not be the cheapest place but surely the best  managed to get a good deal too     Quality of this hotel is just amazing 
N =>  Love love love the Bellagio but it is time to update  Let me start by saying that I adore the Bellagio and would go back in a heartbeat  It has an understated elegance that so many hotels on the strip lack  Even the casino which in true Vegas style  you have to walk through to get anywhere  is subdued and elegant  not at all flashy and trashy like so many other places  The style of the hotel simply cannot be beaten  I found the staff to be extremely helpful and accommodating  Due to the downturn in the economy  we were able to snag a cabana for      for the day  had to haggle  but the concierge accommodated us  Well worth it as our pool day was a luxurious treat  The conservatory and botanical garden are lovely  a must see  We had a lake view room on the   th floor  the view of the fountain show was amazing  We also had a fabulous view of the strip  I love the central location of the Bellagio also  very convenient  Now  as much as it pains me to complain about my beloved Bellagio  I feel I must  While the hotel is spectacular  construction was completed in      and it does need updating  By today s standards  even lesser hotels have flat screen tv s  Bellagio does not  at least not in the rooms I have been in  Also  the carpeting and linens need to be replaced as they are starting to show wear  I feel that in order to keep it s unique elegance  it is time to spruce up a bit  it is starting to show age  The bathroom s are huge and wonderful  but in a space so large  double sinks would be more appropriate than the single sink most rooms have  For the price they charge for the rooms  it would be nice to have free WiFi  even the Days Inn has that I would love to see MGM Mirage invest some money in keeping Bellagio the spectacular resort it was built to be  
N =>  FRAUD at Bel Aire West We pre paid our bill through Hotels for a charge of          AND was incorrectly charged again for         to stay at the Bel Aire West Hotel  advertised as a   Star hotel  with gourmet meals and King size beds  However  upon our arrival  the absolute opposite was true  We were given a room with a full size bed  hard as a rock  there was NO room service for the three days we were there  no fresh bed linens  there was still long  black hairs stuck in the unwashed comforter from the last guest   no fresh towels  no trash picked up  There was no coffeemaker  no coffee  In our room there was a fridge and microwave  however  no plates  no silverware only plastic ware  There were NO gourmet meals  They served velveeta cheese in the omelettes and the ham for the Thanksgiving dinner was as tough as leather  The heater did not work properly  it took serveral hours for the room to heat up  We were told that we could not get our money back  because we had pre paid through Hotels And it is impossible to find another hotel on Thanksgiving weekend  so they knew we were forced to stay there  Upon going to the manager  Cliff Singleton  his response was to only laugh  and then argue with me  At first he tried to claim that we never stayed at his hotel  When I was finally able to reach him to describe our horrible experience there  Mr  Singleton continued to laugh  be beligerent and argue that he was not responsible for correcting the   Star rating for his hotel and that Hotels com was responsible for changing that rating  It seemed he was used to screaming at customers the way he was screaming at me  Then on ember          long after we had checked out Thanksgiving weekend  Mr  Singleton charged us again  for          claiming we did not show up to his hotel  But we were there for three horrible days  I called my bank to let them know that I was now being double billed  when we had already pre paid with Hotels  I can only fill out a complaint form  Meanwhile  Mr  Singleton is allowed to take         from my account which is not legally his  THIS PLACE IS A FRAUD AND A NIGHTMARE     
N => You ve got to be kidding We checked in and checked out within    minutes  Only wish had we had read tripadvisor prior to booking  Used hotels website  WRONG MOVE   Food is disgusting  We went to graba bite after a long drive and found no salvation  Unlike the claims  there is no fine dining  no restaraunt   buffet full of fried food  Rude women claiming to be the  quot owner quot    have no idea what her problem was  She was rude to my husband at check in and that was enough for us Room smelled like mildew   bed was cheap  We imagined a upscale property  Don t let this place sucker you in  Overpriced for a residence daily rental place  
N =>  Mislead Mislead   old folks home   not hotel  Poor service at check in   lost my reservation which was made online  luckily had confirmation with me gross   found   cockroaches in room   smelled musty  Staff was nice but no one seemed to know what to do   everything seemed to be in disarray  waste of money   we checked out and went to mandalay bay   same price for incredible service  
N =>  Retirement Home Advertised as a resort off the strip  FAR off the Strip  my cab driver had never heard of it and could not find it  Had to call for directions  Lots of walking equipment and wheelchairs   no concierge  cafeteria  not a restaraunt  Cheap food  cheap furniture in rooms  Do not recommend to anyone  
N =>   Basic Far from Strip Loud We just got back from a trip across the Southwest and flew into and out of Las Vegas  This hotel is far from the Strip  which is something we actually wanted  The rooms were basic  not super clean  but not disgusting  The neighborhood felt a little dicey  we passed a tent city     blocks long just down the road from the hotel  Our biggest complaint was the noise  We had a door in our room giving us the option of adjoining to the adjacent room  We could literally hear everything that went on the room next door  every word of their conversation  every time they changed channels on TV  everything  We could also hear lots of noise from the room above  when they walked around  when the toilet flushed If you re going to Las Vegas to gamble and see the sights of the Strip  I would look elsewhere  If you need something inexpensive for a night or two  this would suffice  These are budget accommodations  
N =>   Clean roomy nice restaurant and would allow our cats too  Sure appreciated your having a room for us and our cats  This was the first time we have had to find hotels for the four of us  We were happy when the manager said the cats were welcome  We all enjoyed our night  Many thanks  
N =>   Great Place to Stay  Best Western Main Street Inn     North Main StreetLas Vegas  NV           night  on line rate          night pet pet fee  cats acceptedCable TV  coffee maker  on site laundry  and ice machine available  No refrigerator or microwave  Free wi fi We called ahead to ask if we would be allowed to check in early  I explained we were travelling with two cats and had been on the road for some days and needed to do laundry  When we got to the hotel later that day to check in  Phyllis at the desk was the same person I had spoken to  She remembered that I had mentioned we needed to do laundry and had given us a room near the laundry room  Phyllis also asked how our cats were surviving the trip  and hoped they would enjoy their stay  We were also given vouchers for two free beers and     off at the hotel s restaurant  After thanking Phyllis  we went to our room The room was very clean and large  with two queen beds  a desk  a table  and a large television  The bathroom was also a good size and there were two sinks  Our room was in a quiet part of the hotel and spent a relaxing afternoon doing laundry and napping  We also went to a nearby In N Out Burger for a late lunch  which I recommend  That evening we went out to the strip  and the evening clerk was most helpful in telling us how to get to the strip  where to park  and suggestions for what to see  We spent a comfortable night and in the morning packed up and said good bye to Phyllis  If we find ourselves in Las Vegas again  we will definitely stay there  
N =>  ent place but far away from strip Clean and comfortable but far away from strip in a not too nice part of city  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful  Stay here for value and if you re planning to visit off strip attractions  You ll need to rent a car or plan to spend     on cabs because you do not want to be walking in this area at night  Pool is clean but in the middle of the parking lot so not very inviting  
N =>   Not the Best Western Not located near the Strip  Convention Center or the Airport  Falsely advertised shuttle service  Their shuttle service was a mile walk to the city bus  Front desk employees were incredibly rude  I will NEVER stay in a Best Western again  
N =>  Not a Valid Charge I booked a room for          for my brother  Nino with my credit card  I was told that my credit card would not get charged because Best Western doesn t charge charge for a booking unless its business travel  They stated that they will charge my brother s credit card when he arrives  A month later  ember      I saw a charge on my credit card and I called the Corporate Headquarters on Wednesday  ember     at      pm regarding this matter                   I asked for the manager and the clerk told me that he had the authority  I explained my situation and he hung up on me the first time  So I called him back again and he tried to avoid the issue and said  quot sorry quot   This is will not reverse the charge on my credit card  It is not legal to charge someone s credit card without their authorization and this should be corrected immediately by Best Western  This is fraudulent business  Please take action and advise  
N =>  Solo per arrivi dell ultimo momento   Sufficiente economico ma basilare   
N =>  Stolen I traveled with my co workers    we were put in this hotel by the boss      of us in seperate rooms had our digital cameras stolen  I also had my wallet stolen  luckly i had my money and ID on me  DO not stay here   you will get your stuff stolen       
N =>  Terrible And FILTHY   I had reserved this hotel well in advance and was going to stay for   nights  I was traveling with my kids and mom and wanted something off the strip to be calmer and Best Western is a name I know and trust  The room was filthy  bathroom smelled like pee and there was hair in the refrigerator  I made the mistake of moving the night stand over to plug in my phone and found a condom  I did not stay there again and after complaing to the front desk all they did was offer us breakfast which was supoosed to be free anyways  Do NOT EVER STAY HERE   
N =>   Clean and comfortable great sleep  We stayed at this hotel for   days and the Luxor for   days  We had a more enjoyable sleep here then at the Luxor  No long line ups and a short trip to your room  The room was dated but very clean and comfortable  We were pleased to see a refrigerator and a coffee machine  which is great for families  There were a few shady people in the slot machine area but we did not have to walk through this on a daily basis  The bar area was too smokey to enjoy any meals but we did not stay here for the facilities  Although my kids did enjoy swimming in the pool  Overall it served its purpose and we would stay here again if we were passing through  
N =>  Very Stingy with Towels and Toilet Tissue  Mini Fridge doesn t get cold  This place would be nice if the housekeeping staff was allowed to give you enough towels  There are enough when you check in  but the next morning they take away your used towels and don t have enough to re stock the room  This is a very large hotel  even when they are very slow  less than     full according to the desk clerk   they don t have clean washcloths to put in your room    even early in the morning  The room check person will come around after your room is clean  You tell this person you don t have wash cloths  hand towels  or toilet tissue paper and she says someone will bring some right away    Three hours later  we asked her and she didn t remember   she carries that radio but never called for anyone to bring stuff to our room  We went to the front desk and they told us that we need to get that stuff from housekeeping and that it will be put in our room  We had to raid an unattended housekeeping cart just to get the minimal stuff we could get by with   The mini fridge in our room on this stay barely ran  even on it s highest setting  and didn t get can drinks cold enough    we had to haul ice from the first floor to the third floor about three times each day The chain lock for the door was broken  there was nothing on the end of it to hook into the slot on the door We called   times during our stay about the door lock and the fridge  We were told that the fridge would be replaced  quot right away quot  and the door lock would be fixed  quot right away quot   Neither of these were fixed The hot tub doesn t work The pool area is opened and closed at different times each day Today  the pool opened after nine even though they told us it opens at   The  quot high speed quot  internet is extremely slow    It s not much better than dial up access    This place really sucks  
N =>  great just returned after a    day holiday hotel it was worth the money   nice and clean  staff nice and helpful a free shuttle to and from the strip with a great russian driver who went out of his way to help you very enjoyable holiday  breakfast was basic towards the others but good a little bit pricey though  the bar and restrant was the only negitive point of the holiday the male staff was very ignorant and was slow to serve us for food  food was nice when we did get served  would go back again  
N =>   Disappointing at best Where do I start  First  the hotel is in a poor location  meaning that you d rather not stand outside more than necessary  Some of the other guests gave me the creeps as well  They said they were running a  quot free breakfast quot  promotion  but they only gave us two vouchers per room  we had two rooms  and there were five in our party  Extra people were      they said  so we just ate cold cereal in our rooms  Continuing   the rooms didn t feel  quot level quot   like a ball placed on the floor might roll off on its own   the AC and fridge were off when we got there  and their  quot energy saving quot  system where you have to leave your room key in a slot in the wall was a royal pain  Worst of all  our room was on the  rd floor and the only elevator  which was completely on the other side of the property  felt like a death trap  It was about     degrees in there  at  pm   and the floor numbers didn t light up as we ascended  so we seriously started to worry if we were going to die of heat exhaustion before we got there  We ended up hauling the rest of our luggage up the stairs  
N =>  not a good quality hotel service was awful  rooms were not very nice  surrounding area do not feel safe  had to ask for extra pillow four times  each time was told it was on its way  very small bar   and the slot machine did not appear to be very entertaining   barely got a run  slot machine area very small and could not get a seat at the small bar any time  not a good stay 
N =>   Needs TLC but clean We stayed on way home from N Z Rooms need spit n polish but clean Hubby was pickpocked on Strip and staff here were Stars could not have been more helpful more than can be said for staff at Mirage were it happened they would not let me use free number to report card theft and charged     for internet Safe deposit boxes in room pool and sun terrace quiet and clean Shuttle to and from the Strip hourly  am   pm If you are looking for clean cheap hotel with good location this is it Take note major road works due to extend Paradise road over   mnths  yrs not started yet but soon so check before you book   
N =>   Horrible Rooms Horrible Service I stayed at this hotel for a convention that I was attending at the convention center  The rooms were horrible to say the least  It looks like the hotel has not be renovated since it was opened  which was probably about    years ago I moved rooms   times before I found a room that was reasonble in terms of cleaniness and comfort  I was travelling alone  so I put up with a lot of nasty things  I would never take my wife and kids here  
N =>   Great place Great place to stay  No real complaints  About       minute walk to the Strip  Good internet conection  Good breakfast  Didn t gamble in the casino but it seemed okay  For those who won t drive  but fly into Las Vegas they no longer pick up or drop off people at the airport  Also they have a hotel van but will only drop people off at Bally s  no budging for anywhere else  
N =>  We were robbed  We have stayed at Best Western hotel from     to     On      thieves broke into our car and took our video equipments worth        They have tried to break the lock and take the car first  At last they finally broke the glass and took our cloths and video equipments  There is no necessary security available in the hotel  We have heard similar stories from other people who have stayed in the same hotel  On the second day  we woke up in the midnight after hearing some guys talking aloud outside  We were scared  They have left after some time We have decided to leave the next day  and they said they wont refund the amount  Since we have booked our room through hotels com  it was a mess talking to both of them to find a solution  None of them helped  Finally we have decided to stay back in case if we can get our stuff back  The hotel gave us some voucher for food and moved to a room close to the office Unless the hotel increases the security  there is no safety  Even the thieves can take your car away  
N =>   Basic Very basic    Not the best As a travel agent i had a good rate to stay in the MgM grand booked    months in advance  booked for my friends wedding  there was    of us and most of them stayed in between the excalibur and mgm  I unfortunatly lost my job and the hotel when Xl leisure group went bust  therefore i did not have a large budget to re book anything else  still a travel agent got a decent rate at the best western but without looking up reviews as i am far from picky but you get what you pay for here I visited my other friends regularly through out my trip and our hotel comprared to theirs was very upsetting considering i was originaly staying there and paid out alot of money to do so  the decor at best western was awful  small bathrooms  dodgy locals or guests  whichever     wondering around when we got in quiet late  wouldnt have felt safe here without my partner  hit or miss with the staff found them to ber quite helpfull actualy  ok breakfast some days bit grose some days ok  didnt use the pool looked very small and enclosed  ok location even thou off the stirp easy accessible due to free courtesy bus and monorail less than   mins walk away   Bar small smokey and very dull food not all that great again  we ate here once  didnt spend much time at hotel avoided it as much as possible and used it to just get some sleep  next tine would definatly pay more and stay some where else but due to the circumstances of my situation i had no choice but to stay here   
N =>   Comfortable quiet While certainly not the Bellagio or Caesar s Palace  the di Gras was comfortable  quiet  clean  and inexpensive  There was a minor problem with the telephone  but the staff addressed it quickly  Lobby casino was smoky but that appears to be a general hazard in Las Vegas outside the top tier hotels  Our non smoking room was fine  with good beds and a good shower  always an important feature   We found the location convenient  and the staff helpful  
N =>  its not the grand but we loved it i would like to say how we was concerned at the reviews we read about this hotel  We found it was clean the food was good the staff was fantastic the rooms tidy cleaned daily  also the bar was very cheap the service was good   the hotel has     rooms so you meet people  not like the big hotels on the strip where there are thousands we stayed on strip but found this hotel more relaxed  the pool area is good  i would recommend this hotel highly we are both retired we loved our stay at the mardi gras  Ken  amp Pauline LEEDS YORKSHIRE UK 
N =>  Be Warned Hadn t been to Vegas in over a decade and was driving into town calling around for an available room  Picked this hotel out of a AAA book and called  Told them we had   kids and wanted a good pool and walking distance to the strip   quot We have a great pool and we re right off the strip quot  was the answer  so we reserved a room  A good start  but from there it went down hill fast    Pool was freezing cold  I saw lots of people attempt  but only one person make it it and she packed a good deal of insulation  Jacuzzi was heated  but not working  Turns out pool does not have a heating system   Kid s were very disappointed   But  at least their s the strip      Turns out Hotel is     mile from the strip  Not right off the strip or walking distance in my book  They have a shuttle  but it runs only once an hour  not very convenient   Got conflicting advice from hotel staff about ability to park near the strip at other hotels   At this point Dad is getting peeved     Room has binder listing the various activities on the strip  We browsed it and picked out a few to check out  Luckily my wife called ahead to get better directions and found that they were no longer active attractions  One was closed for winter and not due to open until   it was il   the other has closed over   months ago for remodel  Worthless binder of misinformation    They serve a breakfast buffet  but unlike almost all Best Westerns it s not included in the price and costs    a head  Not worth it for what it was    Iron leaked  toilet couldn t handle it  light bulb was out  sheets felt to be full synthetic  scratchy     Hotel is old and need of a complete remodel  The only good point about it is the larger than normal room size  We had non smoking room  but smokers around us were abundant and you could not avoid it About the only good point I could say was the larger than normal room size After discovering all this I complained  but was repeatedly told there was no manager on premise and no way to call one  They said call back at certain time  we did and still no manager  This is a rather large hotel and no manager on site ever  sounds like a run around to me  I finally got  quot a quot  call when I wasn t available and they left a voice message  I called back  still no manager available  I finally got another call back from an assistant who offered to credit my card     dollars  I took them up on it as I figured I never hook up with someone who was really interested in hearing my complaints  
N =>   Stay at your own risk   Booked in here to be within walking distance of the Convention Center    Big Mistake   This place is dilapidated to the enth degree It s not that close to the Convention Center and being a rookie I didn t realize free shuttles run from every conceivable hotel in Vegas to the Convention Center The di Gras is very run down and nasty  There is no casino there are a few slot machines but that is it  Evidently the owner or owners are sitting on some valuable real estate and not putting anything at all back into the facility  As I was checking in there were multiple calls to the front desk about no hot water  When I checked out a couple in front of me complained about no hot water for two days and it was offered to comp their     breakfast Not a nice place but have to say the employees were very friendly and helpful but there wasn t much they could offer to make the place cleaner or better maintained  One day the manager came scurrying out from the office behind the front desk  gave the clerk on duty a through chewing out in a loud voice then scurried back in his hole  
N =>  they don t call it  best  for nothing We called for a pick up at the Airport as soon as we landed and it was there in    minutes  Checked in   hour early with no problems  took maybe   minutes Had dinner on site and it was good and we had the breakfast buffett everyday at        Easy walk to Monorail  Check out was a breeze  we checked out at       and they held our bags for us as we once again went to the strip  we came back at     p m   pick up our bags  the shuttle took us to the airport  and this was AFTER we had already checked out  Great staff  nice rooms  highly recommend  
N =>   Best Western di Gras Las Vegas   bigger ripoff than casinos Booked a stay for two nights at this hotel and then needed to cancel the second night  Deadline for cancelling was      pm on Wednesday before  I called the     number at      and after waiting a few minutes  I spoke with someone who after a few more minutes told me I had to cancel directly with the hotel  I called them  no toll free number available  and after a few minutes was told that I had to cancel through the     number because it was booked over the internet  Well  you get the drift  I called the     number and then was referred back to the hotel and by then it was after      and they would not cancel  I talked to a manager at check in and he refused as well  As an aside  we booked a king sized bed but wound up in the very back of the hotel  noisy area  with two queen beds  Room was not the cleanest but it was acceptable  We left the next day and when I tried to check out from the road I was hit with higher charges for the room  It seems they add extra   on Saturday night  When I complained  the person  Cori  hung up on me  I m still working with my credit card company to get a refund of the excess charges and or unused night  Not holding my breath but Best Western will NEVER get my business again   I ll sleep in my car before staying with them  
N =>   Great Time for our   th Anniversary My wife and I celebrated our   th Anniversary in Las Vegas  We chose this hotel because of the relatively quiet location away from the Las Vegas Strip  The room was large and comfortable  The safe did not work  but it was replaced very quickly  The staff was very friendly and helpful  especially the cleaning staff  Overall  it was well worth the money  There were only two drawbacks  The first was  each time we asked for toiletry items we were charged  We weren t aware of the charges until check out  Also  we ordered pizza from the hotel restaurant late one night  We were told one price over the telephone  but when it was delivered  the price nearly doubled with gratituties  delivery charges  etc  I would recommend this hotel  but don t ask for personal hygiene products or a late night pizza delivery  
N =>  Not even for one night   We only stayed in the di Gras overnight twice   en route to Page AZ  amp  back again  That was more than enough  The check in was late  amp  disorganised   rooms not ready  The rooms were grubby  amp  scruffy to say the least  the air conditioning barely worked  amp  was noisy I wonder what the rooms were like before they were ready on the nights we stayed  The bar  amp  restaurant looked as if it doubled as the local bail hostel   not a relaxing place to be   Even two nights with nearly two weeks in between was too many nights to spend here   definately not a place for the faint hearted who want to sleep in clean rooms  We will never go back   ever   
N =>  Cheap place to stay away from the strip We booked the hotel for one night because we wanted to save a few bucks and be able to easily drive to and from the hotel The room was much larger than expected with a eating counter and refrigerator  but no microwave  Television didn t work  but the staff quickly sent someone up to take care of the problem Breakfast buffet was overpriced         for want you got and the food of poor quality  We also attempted to order a pizza but were told they only offer it after   pm at night and we didn t want to want that long  Overall  I wouldn t recommend eating here The strip is three long blocks away and the monorail station a block away Nothing at the hotel had a New Orleans atmosphere other than the name Overall  a good place to stay if you want to save money and don t mind being a long walk from the strip  
N =>  a bit quiet for myself As hotels go the mardi gras was a nice clean and comfortable hotel type motel but when you are in the best city in the world for hotels   it makes you wonder    was just too far from the strip  we would get the shuttle in the morning then miss it coming back   not to good if you want to go to vegas and take a back seat then this could be the one   
N =>  Good hotel bad service We booked two rooms over memorial weekend  Rooms are very spacious and ok clean  Hotel is a great hotel when it comes to a tourist class hotel  You might want to gamble and eat somewhere else   The only issue I had was the house keeping  When we returned from a long day at around      our room was not made up  I called and complained and they send up the maid  I was in the shower and I told the maid that I need    minutes to finish my shower and get out of the room  Of course you might guess it was going home time and the maid never returned     ever  At night there was no maid service available  Ok I agree this sometimes happens   but what really made me upset is the fact that I brought this to the attention of the manager on duty the next morning after I already have checked out  I did not wanted to have any freebee however he basically told me that it was my fault because I refused service  Of course he was partially right because for    minutes I was in a shower  I guess instead of blaming me a simple sorry would have gone a long way  
N =>   Not the best hotel for our last night in Vegas  Needed to find accommodation for our last night in Las Vegas  but didn t want to risk arriving mid evening and not being able to find somewhere  We also wanted to get a good night s sleep  so chose not to stay at an airport hotel  Booked this hotel in advance through another hotel in the chain  but wish we hadn t Approaching the hotel we began to wonder if we had made a mistake We ended up in a room facing Paradise Street which was fairly noisy due to traffic  As we were on the first floor  it was difficult getting our luggage up the exterior staircase  The room itself was clean  but in need of decoration  Couldn t understand why there is a waist high wall between the two beds We didn t use the restaurant due to the amount of smoke in the casino We complained about a tear in the bedcover and a stain on the bottom sheet and were given a     reduction in our bill by the receptionist  Cost was fairly high  considering what we got Wouldn t use again  
N =>   Not a    Choice Not a terrible hotel but could have been better  After standing in line for maybe    min just to check in  we were told the hotel was over booked so our request to be put in a room by friends was not possible  We were also told that because of being over booked  they could not give us a   queen bed room which we reserved  We were given a queen w  a couch bed  That was fine because they gave us the room at a discount rate and were told to check in the next morning to see if there was another   queen room available for us  We did have to go up and down some stairs which was difficult with suit cases  Once at our room the first thing was noticed was how big the room was  It was nice to see a small divider wall to give some privacy  We pulled out the couch bed and sat down  The first thing we felt was a bar  The mattress had almost no padding in it  We tried laying down and there was still no padding just bars  We contemplated changing hotels but just decided to rough it  We called down and requested a bunch of pillows and blanks that we were going to line the bed with    person slept on the bed on top of a bunch of pillows and another person slept on the floor on the couch cushions and blankets  The next morning there was another room available right down the hall so we changed rooms  The maid was nice and waited for us to grab all our stuff before she started cleaning  It was also nice to have parking right outside our bed room door  Rooms were nice just not the couch bed  Might stay again if needed but will look for another hotel first  
N =>   Not bad for the location Our room was booked as a comp for visit with a time share  Although familiar with Vegas we had never stayed off the strip Rooms were dated but clean   check  in staff was very friendly and gave us a pool side view on the ground floor  As advertised the rooms are larger than a traditional hotel room  The casino consists of only a few slot machines and while the lounge restaurant may be a bit smoky at times it was adequate for drinks we enjoyed at happy hour  Waiter was very friendly and informative  We utilized the  quot top of the hour quot  shuttle service both to and from the airport as well as to the strip  Bally s   I would advise anyone staying here to pay a few bucks and get a rental car  Didnt think I would miss one due to the length of our stay but could have really used one    not much in the way of restaurants or bars within a reasonable walking distance  Not a real bad area but not sure I would recommend walking around the area late at night   not much traffic in the area late in the evening  
N =>  wedding Had a great time  Booked   rooms  on one of the worst weekends in Vegas  Price was high but due to weekend it was great compared to others  booked in at about  pm  one room was ready took   hour for other room  Both rooms where very clean and LARGE    queen beds in each separrated by a half wall  had part kitchen  no stove or micro  but had safe  Parking was good  Front office very good and very friendly  Small casino and I left a small winner  Restaurant was small but good prices and good food  We had breakfast and served by ia  She was very friendly and service very good  I will go back here again  It s a little bit of a walk to anywhere  so a car would be good unless walking is for you  I was apprihensive with what I read from the fellow reviews on this site  but took a chance since it was the only place left in town when I book this place at this cost  I don t regret it one second  
N =>   Great overall stay I booked this hotel with some doubts because of the bad reviews that it had gotten from several travelers  I must say that I totally disagree that this is a bad hotel  I had prompt courteous service from the staff  check in and check out was quick and efficient  and the room was very clean and comfortable  Yes  the walls are a bit thin and allow you to hear noise from outside the room  but I have experienced worse  No traffic noise  no airline noise  or trains to interrupt sleep  I did have a pool garden view room  so I suspect that helped a lot  The casino is very small with only machines to play  and was a bit smokey but not bad  The bar and restaurant were not crowded  and the food was OK for the price  I would probably stay here again  
N =>   Anticipated a poor stay but pleasantly surprised Plan to head out to Vegas for the          weekend and was suprised that most hotels were totally booked or only had high priced rooms available  I finally found Great Western di Gras  got excited  but then I got very concerned after reading mixed reviews  I then tried to find another hotel but was unsuccessful  When I got to the hotel I was very surprised  The place was buzzing with folks checking in  there were folks watching sports on the big screen in the bar restaurant area and folks gambling  Everyone seem to be okay  The folks at the check in desk were real nice    no hassles  Service was quick  The only negative note was when I got to my room  which was nice  there were someone s clothing and bath products on the couch and bathroom area  I don t know why  neither did the front desk   But I did get another room and the room was clean  It was a cozy suite  No folks were hanging around the establishment besides folks staying at the hotel  Location is great    just off of Paradise  which runs parrellel to the strip  Las Vegas Blvd   but the traffic moved much quicker than the strip  It s near the monorail and near the Wynn  One night I hung out after  am  got back to the hotel and got a drink at the bar  The bartender was very pleasant  It s a real comfortable place  Obviously it can t compete with the major hotels but I had a wonderful  safe and relaxing stay  
N =>  Not clean  The room was not cleaned up right  there were hairs in the shower  a dirty towel was still in the bathroom  Also there was a used coffee bag in the machine   did they clean at all      
N =>  Great Hotel off the Strip My husband and I went to the di Gras in Las Vegas it was all we could afford as we did a multi destination trip and we were renewing our wedding vowes there On arrival we found the staff to be very pleasent they helped us with our luggage and made sure we were comfortable in our room We chose this hotel as it has accessible rooms  my husband is in a wheelchair   As disabled rooms go we found this to be about     accessible just a little problem with the toilet which we got around between us The downside is that the shuttle bus is not wheelchair accessible which ment the only way to the strip was either to walk it  if you are fit enough  or if you get the monorail which is fine but quite expensive over   days we spent approx      on monorail fares or of course taxis if you are really rich  the buses are accessible but again you need to get the monorail to get the bus to freemont st The view may not have been fantastic but for a base it was good  we felt quite safe walking back from the monorail centre even at     am  we asked about the area at the monorail centre who said that it was next to a    hotel so the area is perfectly safe  We had no problem at all The restaurant and meals we found to be very resonable for the evening  we didn t bother with breakfast we just went to the   eleven up the road the night before to pick up milk and cereal which we were able to put in the room fridge Overall we found no fault with this hotel apart from not being able to use the complimentary shuttle bus which put added expense on our trip We would go there again  
N =>  Not Recommended First the good bit   rooms are large and beds are comfortable  The air con worked fine and was needed  The bad bits   when we arrived  having been on the go for    hours  we found ourselves waiting at reception for over    minutes  Two receptionists were dealing with customers  a third clearly had important paperwork to complete before he could deal with us  Once his paperwork was complete he did deal with us quickly and efficiently Their Welcome Pack says you will get help from their friendly porters  When we asked for assistance with our luggage  we were a party of four with one disabled member  we were told they did not offer porter assistance but we  quot might quot  be able to find a luggage trolley  quot out back  quot  We struggled through the hotel lobby to the rear exit and by chance found a trolley which we then had to manhandle to the other end of the complex and into the elevator to the third floor  A porter near the scene disappeared with some alacrity but surprisingly re appeared once we had off loaded the luggage into our rooms  Perhaps he expected a tip for  quot providing quot  the trolley but he didn t get one For four or five nights we found the plumbing to be extremely noisy and were woken up at   am    am and   am on different occasions  The water kept running  seemed to be refilling cisterns  for anywhere between    minutes and    minutes  Sleep was impossible  Strangely this didn t seem to happen at the weekends  They say they have a free shuttle to the Strip  No they don t  They have a free shuttle to the western end of Bally s on Flamingo  You have a quarter of a mile hike from there to the Strip The food was OK but compared to other hotels was a bit on the pricey side  e g        for breakfast whilst in Terrible s  just up the road  the same breakfast was less than    and we thought the food in Terrible s was noticeably better  The breakfast buffet in the di Gras was OK but eating in the so called restaurant meant eating in the bar complete with smoke and noisy gaming machines and one or two over excited sports fans Room cleaning was a bit spasmodic  The beds were made and towels were changed but other than that nothing was touched It was a place to sleep  it s not the worst hotel in Vegas and its location isn t too bad but it is definitely not value for money and it certainly put us off Best Western hotels and motels for the future  
N =>   Cheap Hotel with good rooms Stayed at the Best Western in august       Found all the staff very helpful and friendly   good to chat to the bar staff to find places to go which are off the strip Rooms where cleaned everyday  Cold water provided in rooms at       per bottle  Fresh towels   soap etc also provided The air conditioning was powerful  kept the room cool all night Food was ok   nothing great but good value Bonus is the shuttle taxi to the strip and to the airport  
N => Big rooms and friendly employees  This motel surprised me  It was not only clean  but the room is gigantic and the bed was very comfortable  The rooms are more like suites and have a small kitchen area There is no fancy decor  but who cares  We weren t there to admire the furnishings The employees were extremely freindly and helpful  They went out of their way to treat us like special guests If we ever go back to Las Vegas  I m pretty certain this will be the motel I choose to stay at again and again  
N =>  Perfectly nice We weren t looking for anything fancy in Vegas  so we picked this place off the Strip  The service was friendly  the check in lines weren t long  and our room was nice  with lots of counter space and a fridge  and a really comfortable bed  I was disappointed that there wasn t internet access in the room  Our room was across from the pool  and there was some music and talking at night  but only just a bit  The pool closes at   PM so it wasn t a problem  We ve learned to bring earplugs when we stay at hotels  which I highly recommend  They re a life saver This hotel has a great location because of its proximity to the Monorail  a pricey but very convenient and super reliable way to get to the Strip  It s very easy to use  and isn t even     mile up the road from the hotel We don t gamble  we just turned     so we didn t use the casino This place is absolutely fine  if nothing special  But we came to Vegas for Vegas  not the hotel     I would come back again  
N => Not a good experience This was our last hotel stop after driving around southern Utah  before flying on to New York  We booked this in advance of the holiday and if our previous experiences of Best Western hotels was anything to go by  we should have been very pleased  Not quite so  The check in desk is completely overwhelmed by the noise of the slot machines because this hotel lobby is packed full of them  We were given a room that was away from the road and was quiet and being able to park the car outside the door did improve things  The room was clean but the decor  furniture and bed linen were very tired  The whole place needed renovating and brightening up  The pool looked ok but as it is small and crowded by the buildings around it  it wasn t inviting  Breakfast was offered in the seating area opposite the check in desk and even at   in the morning  it was noisy and over crowded  Poeple had been waiting in the queue to be seated for at least    minutes and the people who had started their breakfast  were complaining with some people simply leaving their half eaten meals on the table  It did not bode well but we were not to be put off  Pity really because the food that was meant to be hot  was only warm and the time it took to arrive at the table may have explained why  Even the staff were complaining about the problems  
N =>  Friendly Staff The best part of this hotel is the staff  They were very friendly and helpful  We also liked not having to walk a mile to get to our room  The room we had was larger than expected  There was a mini kitchen area  Sleeping areas are divided by an archway  Only one TV  The price was great and the room was clean  No complaints  
N =>  Problems at the di Gras BW We stayed ch    thru the   th  During that time our room was cleaned only once  Trash was left  amp  no condiments were given for coffee maker in the room  Last day there was no cook in the restaurant  amp  could not order breakfest  We got what we paid for  cheap  Overall  staff was friendly but not very helpful  
N =>   Won t stay anywhere else in vegas I stayed here for a Passion Parties Convention this ch  Since it was  quot convention time quot    quot Spring Break Week quot  and  quot Nascar week quot  everywhere else was outrageously priced  After packing my entire family into one tiny room last year  that I paid      a night for  there was NO WAY I was paying that again for a tiny little room  I read some bad and some good reviews of the di Gras  So the main reason I decided to stay there since the  quot nightly average quot  was about     per night  I have to say that their customer service at the desk wasn t the best  Not just at checkout but throughout the whole stay  One of the nights we were there their phones were down completely and we couldn t call to see when the shuttle was making it s last run to Bally s to pick us up  However  the rooms were clean  When my TV didn t work  instead of getting me a new TV  they moved me to a new room  Which was just as clean  The room was HUGE  It had a nice living room area  kitchenette and bed area  You could see the TV from the bed if you wanted to lay around and veg  The restaurant in the front lobby had good food  However  there was a sign in the room to call down and order pizza and when I tried this when I first checked in  after a   hour flight  they said  quot We don t have any pizza quot   They have a free shuttle that picks you up drops you off at the airport every    minutes or so  The sign in the hotel says every hour but the shuttle drivers were going every half  The shuttle also brings you to Bally s for free  So you can reach the strip and see all the sights with no problem  I also have to say that it was more like a  quot upscale motel quot  than a  quot hotel quot   But for the money  the size of the room  the cleanliness and the nice courtyard in the middle with the pool and gazebo  I ll stay there again and again and again  Especially since I won t be going to convention during Nascar and Spring Break Week next year  
N =>  wasnt disappointed After reading a lot of negative reviews about this hotel we were wondering what we had let ourselves in for we arrived at about  pm the guy on reception was very pleasant we asked for a pool view and non smoking room and that is what we got i was expecting to be greeted by a wall of smoke but the casino area was quite smoke free it was a bit smokier on the weekend Going into our room we had our eyes shut and fingers crossed it was a pleasant surprise the room was very clean nice fluffy towelsin the bathroom no shower gel but hey that wouldnt spoil our holiday  we always take that with us anyway even when we stay in a   star The fridge was clean as was the kitchenette you have to get a pin to use the safe the guy on front desk told us it was   a day but it was worth it when we took it back on checking out we didnt get charged said it was included in our package pool was very clean i think that was because no one used it it was not heated like getting into an ice bath that was the only downside to this motel the staff were friendly gave us extra coffee etc for our room when asked for it is in an ideal location you can walk to circus circus in about       mins or you can use the monorail about    mins walk or the hotel shuttle bus which was free Didnt get a chance to sample the food  We would definately come back again it was good value for money 
N =>  It was okay for the money The Hotel staff at the Front desk was very helpful and friendly  The persons working in the Casino seemed to be put out if they had to get a cocktail or drink for you  Very smoky in the lobby checkin  amp  casino   The rooms were adequate in size  however not the cleanest rooms  The linens and bathroom were clean  The carpets were not  looked like they were spot vacuum not reaching the edges or near the tables  
N =>  Tired off strip hotel A Very tired hotel  The room was larger than average but was not cleaned well  Still food in fridge from previous occupant  Not far from the Monorail but not a pleasant walk after dark  Cheaper hotels on the strip  
N =>  smokey We asked for a non smoking room when we booked this hotel  When we checked in  no non smoking room was available anymore  so we got a smoking room  The smell was awful  We asked for some intensive ventilation or air spray to move this smell from the room  During our   night stay nobody showed up  although we asked four     times  After our stay my clothes also smelled like tobacco Hairs have been found in the shower  the airco was also not working very well From the outside it was possible to shift the window glasses out of the window  and so it was possible to open the room door from the outside Plus  they gave us a breakfast refund because nobody showed up to refresh the air in the room  There are better and cheaper hotels in Las Vegas  
N =>  di Gras Las Vegas Had a brilliant time  Hotel was very nice will definately go there again  We went self catering  Hotel food was really nice staff were all friendly and were always there to help you  Pool was lovely and clean  Free shuttle bus was a god send  Can t wait to go again to Las Vegas and will hopefully stay at the di Gras again  
N =>   Worst place I ve ever stayed   Beware  Upon arrival  my non smoking room I had reserved was not available  so I ended up in a smelly  dark  smoking room  The carpets and linens were filthy  I came back one day around lunchtime to find several of the cleaning staff in the doorway of my room  smoking and watching soap operas  The casino was dark and full of smoke  elevator was shaky and also smoky  and I was afraid to come back to the hotel alone at night  I travel frequently  often to foreign countries and this is by far the scariest and dirtiest place I ve ever been  To top it off  they charged my debit card I had used to hold the room  instead of the credit card I gave them at check in  which resulted in overdraft fees  Best Western corporate was going to refund the fees  but the management of the hotel  privately owned  not corporate  refused and also would not return phone calls or e mails  I would rather sleep on the streets than stay here  
N =>  Good for the money Lobby  Avoid it if you can  especially if you are a non smoker  The front desk staff are very attentive and seem to be able to handle the large amount of traffic that goes through the front deskRooms  Our room was very clean  It was nice and spacious and seem to have a kitchenette w o the stove or microwave  It might have been one in years  past  but it was a nice place to put everything  I also liked the fact that the two beds were seperated within the room  you can see a picture of this on the Best Western website  Pool Jacuzzi  Okay for sunbathing  but the jacuzzi was not even remotely hot enough and the pool was not heated  so too cold to go into  It was clearly kept up though and the entire outside was clean Restaurants  Did not have a chance to eat at their restaurants  but there is a McDonald s within walking distance  
N =>   Not bad for the price Traveled to Las Vegas for a quick business trip   choose this hotel for price and location to business  not strip The lobby is a bit sketchy  I was a little worried when checking in  However  room was very large  as compared to more expensive hotels  and clean  AC worked great and housekeeping did a nice job  TV was fine   who watches TV in Vegas anyways  Never got to the pool  but seemed very popular and crowded  Staff was helpful for the most part  but shuttle service is dismal  Extremely inconvenient and not worth the bother  As one reviewer wrote  it s a LONG walk to the strip   however  legitemate cabs with friendly drivers always seemed to be out front whenever I walked out the door Dinner at the restaurant was good and people watching was very entertaining  However  I wouldn t recommend chatting anyone up  Was able to pay cash for breakfast brunch thingy and staff members were concerned that I hadn t gotten my moneys worth by taking too little  
N => Not Impressed     Stayed there for two weeks and as much as we love Vegas couldn t wait to go home This hotel really spoilt the holiday The staff weren t very friendly  we were told they were   We couldn t have breakfast one morning because we didn t have a voucher  obviously cash isn t acceptable these days but were told we could purchase food in the restaurant which also happens to be the bar area We found somewhere to eat on the  quot strip quot  instead and also had the added expense of a taxi as once again the shuttle had broken down This happened a few times throughout our stay and given the location it s quite a trek to the strip They won t change more than      a day in travellers cheques which is really annoying as it meant I had to carry my passport around with me as I D And if you fancy entering the weekly karaoke to win the cash prize don t bother The locals come in every Friday sing a few songs and WIN    thats how it seemed to us anyway  On the plus side however the pool area is nice and relaxing the rooms are a good size and the maids are very pleasant Going back to Vegas this year but booked a hotel on the strip so we re right in the middle of the action  
N =>  Slow and unorganized As far as the price goes  this place is decent for a Saturday night  As far as the service goes  it        The check in time was      pm  I booked   rooms and only one was ready  they said to wait and the other room would be ready in a few minutes  The few minutes turned into    minutes and when I called the front desk they said just a few more minutes  After waiting over one hour  the other room was finally ready  We get to the rooms and one of them has a broken door and both had a musky feeling to the rooms  Make sure you re drunk by the time you get back to your room so that you won t realize what a dump your staying at  
N => A bit faded but       Stayed   nights                First impressions were not too favourable but we warmed to this hotel very quickly  Rooms were huge   we had   Queen beds   and well equipped  TV aircon heating system  fridge and coffee maker   Hot water shower brilliant  food excellent and good value  towels changed daily  sun terrace and swimming pool  with hot tub  very convenient  small shop immediately outside front door serving all daily needs   hairdresser too if required   staff very friendly and helpful  convenient for monorail  at least     parking spaces should you wish to rent a car  OK the neighbours were noisy  that s not the hotel s fault  but one call to Front Desk at      produced immediate response and it didn t happen again  A big plus for us was  having accidentally charged us twice for one meal  which we hadn t noticed when the final bill was presented  they re credited us within    hours   a pleasant surprise on the bank statement  All in all  at     per night  excellent value  We wouldn t hesitate to stay here again  
N =>  great hotel at a great price Hugh roon  Great food  Loose slots   I actually took money home   Beutiful pool  Overly friendly staff always willing to help  Funny van driver told us all about Las Vegas  Could not have picked a better hotel  
N =>  wasn t bad at all We just got back from Vegas last week     th   stayed at the di Gras for   nites  The rooms were clean  just average  price was good and only   blocks away from the Monorail  which saved us a lot of money getting around  The restaurant there was good  large portions   breakfast was really good  hope this helped everyone  Linda 
N =>  Good value for money The hotel was basic  ie no frills  but clean  The staff were helpful  The restaurant was good  the food was reasonably priced and waitresses were friendly A pity the hotel wasn t closer to  quot the Strip quot   but the courtesy shuttle bus was very convenient  A good hotel for a family vacation  
N =>  Up to expectations  The staff was especially friendly  The room was very spacious and well designed  Most of the fixtures were new or well maintained Bathroom was above average  Landscaping was nice  Large courtyard and pool spa  Las Vegas monorail is still not running broken  so rent a car  
N =>  Never treated so terribly in my life Not only did we reserve   rooms   months in advance  but we also called the day before to re confirm   needless to say we waited    minutes at the check in desk   all to hear that they had no record of our reservations  It was VERY late and there were    of us  including a small child  so we waited  Luckily  they had rooms available  One of the rooms that they gave us was occupied  and another one was never cleaned from the last guests  When we finally got to our room  It smelled heavily of urine and beer  this was NOT the room that wasn t cleaned  I dropped something on the floor  and that s when I almost fainted at the smell of urine  When I walked into the bathroom  I noticed some unexpected guests  there were   cockroaches on the floor    dead    alive  I called my mom in another room  she too had a cockroach in her room  I was disgusted  I called the front desk and was told that this is common in Las Vegas and shouldn t worry about it  Being that I had never been there before  I shrugged it off  The last straw I had was when the waitress in the  quot restaurant quot  rolled her eyes at me when I asked her if she was going to wait on us after sitting there for    minutes  and told me to  quot just give me your order  ok  quot   So I asked to speak to the manager to tell him that we were checking out early  and was told that was fine  but we were still going to pay for the   nights that were reserved  I questioned him by saying that I was told that we had no reservation  according to his staff the night before   he laughed and said that it didn t matter  we still had to pay in full for the nights reserved  I couldn t believe the rude  unthoughtful service we received  I don t recommend staying there  
N =>  Good for the price If you are looking for a resonable price place to sleep this is a good place  Not fancy  just a plain room but very roomy  clean and comfortable  The restaurant s food was good and resonably priced  Service was a bit slow but friendly  Their little casino was a nice place to play a few slots  I even won a few dollars  Their desk clerks were a little unknowledgable and didn t want to go out of their way but fairly effecient  Overall  it served our purpose nicely  
N => 	 WEDDING We are staying her    days in      for our Las Vegas Wedding  ABSOLUTLY PERFECT    Room clean  Services excellent  etc   We are come back last year and we come come back again in ember   Thanks 
N =>  Health Department Problems w Pool Went to spend a weekend away from the house and decided to stay at the Best Western di Gras  When we arrived we were disappointed to find out that the pool was being re surfaced and was closed  Unfortunately  we were not allowed to cancel our reservation without penalty  So  we stayed  Corporate and local management failed to provide any consideration for the lack of the pool  even though the pool was advertized  Then we discovered that Clark County Health Department had cited the Best Western di Gras and closed its pool  So  you have to ask  if the pool fails the health department test  what about the restraurants I have found that Best Western di Gras is a good deal only if you are planning on slumming  
N => found it to be a nice room clean and staff was fine  We spent two nights here in late il  Had read all of the reviews but since I had booked this same hotel for a convention in the fall that my sister and I planned to attend wanted to check it out since I was traveling with my husband  Was very glad to find the price was good and room was clean  No noise problems  Food in restaurant was good  They gave us two free breakfast coupons  and one dinner free with purchase of one  Food was very good and staff friendly  especially the waiters we had  Large room  Only thing I would like to change is to have microwave in room  and have tv in front of bed  Was located in front of couch but hard to see if watching news  etc  after retiring at nite  Will stay with my reservation in the fall  Off the strip but ok  Will have monorail system they say in the fall so that will help with getting to the strip  
N =>  good place to stay My husband and I recently stayed at the mardi gras  We were there from ch             We enjoyed our stay  The rooms are nice  Although we had a non smoking room  When the towels got wet they smelled like smoke  The pool was nice  Wasn t noise  The restrauant had good food  The staff behind the counter could have been a little more friendly  but altogether we had a GREAT stay  I d stay there again  It wasn t that far off the strip either  
N =>  Horrible experience We arrived at the Best Western on Thursday     and were told that our reservation was for     and since we were a no show our reservations were cancelled  We made our reservation in tember at the local hotel not the     number to receive special senior pricing  We received a reservation number and reconfirmed the first week of ruary  Even though we had a local confirmation number  we were told that the reservation was made through the     number  We were offered a  quot walk in quot  rate for Thurs  amp  Friday but no room for Sat  amp  Sun  No attempt was made to find us a room  I walked to the Embassy Suites and although they had no room available  they called around and secured a hotel for us for   days  The hotel was located two blocks from Bally s and a wonderful find  
N =>  great place to stay After reading these reviews i was dreading going to the mardi gras  To add to the disapointment of being moved from the strip because of the convention we were told we were going to this place  I myself found it very friendly  the staff were great and really made a big fuss of us  the drivers of the bus  we had    were very nice offering to take us to any hotel we wanted  even though there route is just to the airport or ballys  they even took us to the rio to see penn and teller after they heard us discuss it in the bar  Our room was huge with   queen sized beds  and although i agree that this isnt the best kept best western  i cannot blame the staff  they kept our room spotless and never came to the door if the do not disturb sign was out  The overall state of the place is a bit run down but the staff do their utmost to keep it clean  If best western spent a bit of money and gave them something to work with then this place would be great If you want a great hotel then my advice is to pay the money and book one  but from my experience not all the strip hotels are fab A great place to stay  clean friendly and very helpful  if a little off the beaten track  but that really didnt prove a problem 
N => The worst B W   
N =>  A little disappointing  
N =>  Not the quintessential Las Vegas experience  
N =>  Basic ally good   
N =>  super service  
N =>   Disappointed We have stayed in a lot of Best Western Hotels and this was probably the worst  We were given a room behind the kitchen and the banging and dropping started at  a m  That was not good as we were staying out late   There saving energy system was bad as we could not get the air condintioning to work and we got a dribble of water from the shower head  We were told they had an hourly bus to the strip and that was not true  So we did figure out public transportation but they have not information on that  We would not stay there again  
N =>   Small rooms with fleas We stayed at this hotel a few years ago and it was nice  This time however is was horrible  We asked for a room on the first floor because we had a flight at      am and didnt want to disturb other guests  We were given a room on the  rd floor and as far from the elevator as you can get  We had already waited   hour past the check in time and they said it would be another hour until a room would be ready  So we stayed   we were unable to sleep all night for the ice machine was right next to our room and made ice all night  To top it off my wife was bitten by fleas or something on neck and shoulders  Then on check out they over charged us and have yet to respond to us about it  
N =>   Wonderfull Stay Hotel was nice although minor improvements can be done  staff was very helpfull to our needs  Price was excellent   
N =>   Clean room  Bring your own pillows  Close and convenient to airport  and hotel offers free shuttle service Basic breakfast   bread  mini muffins  cereal  plain oatmeal  hot waffles  coffee  tea  juice       quot  high decorative pillows look nice  but uncomfortable  Could not get replacement pillows from front desk as housekeeping was closed at   pm  Stuffed some towels in the pillowcase Room was nicely decorated and clean  
N =>  Probably would have been better if it hadn t been for room location I booked this room with an employee rate so I m not sure what the regular rate would be  Stayed in a room with a king bed  Room was clean and had the basics  There was a minor maintenance issue with one of the outlets being loose so that any cord that was plugged in it would fall out  Was kind of inconvenient  The only major gripe I had was that I was placed in a room right next to the housekeeping breakfast storage room  Early in the morning  I was awakened to rather loud clanking and banging of breakfast items being either cleared away or put out  I m not sure  And it was LOUD  I think I heard someone else go to the front desk and complain about it  Why you would put a room there is beyond me  Other than that  my stay was satisfactory  The staff was okay  they weren t overly friendly but I gues they did their job  The location was pretty close to the Strip  If you have a car great  if not  then it might be kind of a walk  
N =>  Feels like home We had to go travel to Las Vegas on the spare of the moment to visit a sick relative  After reading lots of reviews from pass customers I chose Best Western McCarran Inn and was not disappointed  The room was very clean and staff very friendly and helpful  There was a problem with their internet system   too slow   however  I must say the reviews were not wrong about the great breakfast waiting for us in the morning  Overall  I would not hesitate to stay there again  
N =>   Convenient Location   Nothing bad to say We arrived on a late flight and were really happy to have chosen this place as our first stay  It s close to the airport  it s clean  it s cheap      in Vegas   there s even breakfast  I honestly have nothing bad to say  We weren t disturbed by any noises  Ok  this isn t a romantic place  but very good price versus quality  Make sure to reserve in advance  this place was fully booked  
N =>   Great Location for fly out of Mc Carran Clean and great staff  some noise from airport but not real bad  not far from strip  would stay again  
N =>  Basic hotel just off the Strip Our hearts sank when we entered the lobby which is rather gloomy  but to be fair  our room was good  clean with a king size bed  It had all the amenities we needed and expected  Bed was very good  We slept very comfortably  You do get aircraft noise and also we were at the back of the hotel where there is a bus depot  A couple of times we heard buses reversing  Overall  though  it was an ok hotel which was cheaper than staying on the strip  They do a shuttle to the strip and the airport  We had a car so did not use this  There are public transport buses that run down Tropicana Avenue that you can also use Breakfast was included so we had this a couple of times  bagels to toast and waffles to make  but generally we just got a cup of tea and went out to the breakfast buffets at the big hotels on the strip  I would consider this hotel again  but if we did not have a car  it is probably worth paying extra to stay in one of the strip hotels  That way you are not reliant on waiting for public transport or the shuttle  
N =>  Absolute worst stay since          Keycards wouldn t work  Not one set  not two sets  not three sets  Not if I tried them  not if any of four employees tried them  But master keycards worked  No employee believed me about keys until they tried them  and once they didn t work for them they passed me off to another employee    No offer of another room  Dark  dingy halls and entry area    Didn t tell me air conditioner needed WORKING keycard to operate  Room hot    No screen on window on a first floor room  Window hidden from view by brick wall  so anyone hiding there wouldn t be seen  Great for sleeping soundly    Very nicely furnished room    Jets overhead every minute or so for nearly four hours  And I mean only a few hundred feet above the room    Worst of all  I chose this hotel because I stayed here years ago  Before the airport changed the takeoff pattern  What a mistake  
N =>   Waited an hour for the airport shuttle pool wasn t heated We had to wait almost an hour at the airport for the shuttle  even though the hotel is only   mins from the airport  They told us it would only take    mins for the shuttle to arrive  Had we known it was going to be an hour  we would have taken a taxi  We could have walked the distance in much less time When we complained about the wait  the front desk didn t care about the delay nor was a manager available Also  being from Canada  we weren t worried about an outdoor pool in ember  as long as it was heated  Unfortunately  it is definately not heated and is very  very cold  Don t plan on using it except in summer  I mentioned this at the front desk and they said it was heated  but refused to come and feel the water or measure the temperature   it was very  very cold and definately not heated Finally  the phone in our room didn t work  so they offered to change the room  but it wasn t worth the hassle  
N =>   A perfect place to stay  Two of us stayed at the Best Western McCarran for two nights  The staff was welcoming and wanted to help us in any way possible  Our room was standard with no frills but it was clean and the beds were very comfortable  The free shuttle took us to and from the airport and the Strip  All we had to do was call for it  The breakfast was more than adequate  juice  coffee  muffins  and French toast plus cereals  Because of our departure time  a shuttle driver came in very  very early to take us to the airport on his own time  This was our first trip to Las Vegas  we were really here on a stopover and wanted to experience the Strip so arranged to stay an extra day  The motel was a perfect location and we were treated royally  If we re out that way again  we will definitely make arrangements to stay at the Best Western  
N =>   Old  We chose this particular place because it was close to the airport andthe price was right        But as soon as we arrived and entered the building it  quot reeked quot  of cigarettes  We are not smokers so we  quot gagged quot  a little  all the way to our room  The room was old but just okay  The breakfast in the morning was sufficient  bread  cereals  good coffee  Glad to check out and be on our way  The airport transportation was a plus  
N =>  Airport Shuttle Issues and Rude front desk staff My recent stay at this hotel was a big disappointment  I checked out the website before booking here and one of the reasons I picked this hotel for this one night stay is because I needed airport transportation   a hard thing to come by in Las Vegas unless you like taxis  In any case  the listing says that the hotel provides airport transportation and some transportation to a couple of named casinos  generous right    Well  what the listing DOES NOT say  is that the hotel only operates that service until  pm  which we  of course  landed later and had to wait in those lovely taxi stand lines   And then the next morning  when we needed a ride to the airport  we were told the shuttle only ran on the     hour and even though the van was there at a quarter past the hour  we still had to wait another    minutes for them to take us to the airport  be that is their  quot policy quot  but it wasn t made clear as to what those policies were before booking the room and honestly  as far as customer service is concerned  I think that is a poor decision not to run your shuttle in a  quot city that never sleeps  quot  On top of the shuttle disappointment  when we checked in to the room  the lady at the front desk  was rude and just in a  quot general bad mood  quot  Again  not the face and attitude one wants to see when already disappointed in a service error and then have to deal with rudeness too  She started out rude to my husband and I  but we are good at making people treat us better by just adding a little kindness  That worked  but when additional customers arrived and asked about room availability or customers who called and asked questions about why the shuttle service wasn t running  she was rude to them    which also was annoying  From my perspective of overhearing several inquiries about the shuttle service ending at  pm  it was something many of their customers did not know and was disappointed to find out  The room itself was clean and comfortable  The lack of  quot black out quot  shades was missed since we arrived so late and wanted to sleep in the next morning  The breakfast was better than many that hotels offer  Some kudos for that Best Western hotels  in general  are lovely places to stay  I would have to say even consistently nice  This one is the exception  I would not stay here again  
N =>    Best  Western  NOT  We reserved the room a week in advance  When reserving online  an option for a non smoking room was not given  When we arrived  the room reeked of cigarettes  We asked the staff to switch our room but they claimed they were completely full  We considered demanding a refund  but after considering the facts  Saturday night in Vegas  over     degrees  and we had been driving all day and were tired  we decided that we did not wish to look for another hotel  Once settling in the room  we realized that the fitted sheets on the beds were too small and continually came off  The air conditioner was very loud and irritating  Overall  this was a very poor hotel and I would not recommend  
N =>   Close to the airport but quiet  After reading through the reviews of Las Vegas hotels I finally decided on the Best Western McCarran  I felt this hotel offered the best value for the money although the close proximity to the McCarran airport would be determental to any chance of a good nights sleep  Boy was I surprised  Either they flew a Southwesternly departure route or I was really tired  Only once did I hear a plane departure  The facilities were absolutely imaculate  The room was very nice although there wasn t a refridgerator or microwave in the room  Hotel security was very good  Morning breakfast was the normal continental breakfast items  juices coffee  bagel and sweet rolls  and cereal  There was wireless internet throughout the building but when you don t have your own PC it doesn t do a bit of good  I wish they had a  quot business center quot  for guests  The guest laundry room was very handy and clean  The swimming pool was closed for repairs  I recommend this facility if you want to visit Vegas on a budget  
N =>   Good Value and close to airport We stayed at this Best Western as it was close to the airport and quite reasonable  The room was clean and comfortable  the breakfast that was included was basic but good  and the location near the airport can t be beat  Be sure to request a room on the east side to avoid traffic noise  Never heard any aircraft at all   We would stay here again  
N =>   Great retreat from the strip I travel annually to Las Vegas on business and have found staying in casino hotels to be a real pain  you either have to wait for the valet or park a mile away  then it s a major headache negotiating the casino on the way to your room  The McCarran Inn which is located near the airport but close enough to the south strip to be very convenient is great  Park within    feet of the front entrance  walk in and be in your room in less than    seconds  Large rooms  they are well maintained and clean  The noise from hallway in the early morning can be a little irritating  but not as bad as I have found at casino hotels where I have been awakened in the middle of the night by a bunch of drunk partiers  Best Western has free calls in the US and now most of their properties offer free wireless internet  This is truly a bargain  even though its not fancy  
N =>   don t smell this place The price must of been right cuse my company put here for   days  first off what they did not say was they will not pick you up at the air port after a spacific time on most days  second the room I was given was a view of the pool that did not in any way look good   rd the bed was very hard and that lead me to aroung   hr  of sleep every day I was there   th the pellows smelled like smoke from a pipe   I know what you are thinking and yes it was a smoking room but this was the first on where you did not have to smoke to get you nicaten    th the van driver when i did get one ride from him to the strip was very nice and helpfull  neddless to say I called the air port in my  rd day in vegas and was able to change my flight out early  I did tell my boss I would rather get fired then stay in a place like this agin  
N =>  One armed bandit Rooms ok but high priced for location  Lost a dollar in the Coke machine and the front desk wouldnt refund it   quot stating it was policy not to refund lost money in the coke machine  quot  Can you believe that  service policy poor for an over      a night hotel  Coke machine must be a good money maker  
N =>  OK for airport hotel We stayed here for   night before flying out of Vegas  It was fine as a one night stop only  as it wasn t really close enough to The Strip   amenities to stay any longer The room was clean and modern and we used the pool  which was a nice extra to the hotel Would stay here again   recommend for   night stays  
N =>  Dont Swim In The Pool    Got this room for     on Priceline for one night     this was just a room to crash for our late nite flight back home to NJ     Okay     this was no Bellagio   LOL    the room was clean    but you could see this was an old resort    the room and halls had a musty odor   like mildew or something    I wouldn t stay here unless I HAD NO OTHER place to go to   The pool was a joke    I was wondering why no one was swimming   until I got closer to it     it was pretty dirty   with leaves and dead bug carcasses strewn on the bottom of the pool    yuck  I overheard a front desk clerk tell someone that they were sold out that nite     but the normal rate for the weekend was            they got to be kidding   for that money  I could stay at any fancy one on the strip   Bottom line   if you MUST be super close to the airport   its okay   Just dont expect anything like you would expect from a hotel like Bellagio or Venetian  
N =>  Good price quality This certainly isn t a luxury hotel casino resort  but if you want a clean room for a good price  then this is it  Self serve continental breakfast consists of the usual drinks  milk  juice  muffins  cereals  french toast  bread  oatmeal  Those items are frequently restocked The hotel is close to the airport  therefore handy for a first or last night  It can be a bit tricky to find it  because it s in a one way street  When you ask directions at the car rental company at the airport  it should be no big problem to find it  however  In our room  we could hear the airplanes  but the noise was sufficiently reduced to be able to sleep comfortably  
N =>  absolutely horrible place My family stayed our last night at this place because we had a   am flight the next morning and had to take the shuttle  which by the way was so late to leave the hotel that we almost missed our flight back to atlanta  This place was so nasty and moldy  I could nor hardly sleep  Also  the air conditioner wasnt working well either in     degree weather  I felt like i was smothering all night long  There were no other rooms to put us in  so they said  i would never stay here again  I would walk to the airport from the strip  before staying in that place again  
N =>  Ant Hotel ober       This was not my best Vegas vacation  This was a family vacation   people total I thought that I was getting   queen beds and a pull out sofa  I got   queen beds and a pull out chair   Beware  The closet is nearly non existant And the ants  We went to sleep and got bit  That day they cleaned out the ants  we think   but they missed the few in the bathroom  We had to live with those the whole stay Oh  their website says that the pool is heated  it is not  It was too cold for even the kids to go in I forgot to mention in my earlier review that the continental breakfast from              ran out of danishes and french toast everyday by       The breakfast consisted of danishes  french toast  bagels or croissants when the first two ran out   bread for toast  corn flakes  fruit  juices  milk and coffee The good thing was that there was always plenty of coffee  
N =>  I d do it again Hey  we were looking for a cheap place to stay on our final night of vacation  This place is not bad  Close to the airport and the Strip  Easy to turn the car back in and get back to the terminal  Not the cleanest or the nicest  but you get a decent continental breakfast before catching your flight  For      it fit the bill perfectly for us  I d do it again  
N =>  Horrible Stay Will never stay here again  No hot water on any of the   days we stayed there  Left over soaps and shampoos in the tub and on the sink from the previous person that stayed there  Air conditioner would not cool the room  We roasted at night  Breakfast was just ok  no decaf available though  Internet would not work and front desk clerk was clueless  
N =>   Never againt  Booked this motel for   nights  on our arrival we were told that the pool was closed for a few days as the owner had to make repairs then get it inspected before his licence could be renewed  We found out the next day that all the owner had to do was go to city hall to collect his licence  I and other guests badgered the owner every day for   days when he eventually went and got it  The pool was filthy and had to be cleaned by guests of the motel  Pool was supposed to be heated but it WAS NOT  I got the impression that neither the owner or his staff couldn t care less We found the location very noisy with jet fighters constantly flying around all day long as Nellis air force base is just across the Road and is used for jet fighter training  We wished we had picked somewhere closer to the strip as we clocked the distance to be approx    miles The area isn t nice at all and there isn t many restaurants Definitely could not recommend this motel  its nothing like the description and pictures on their website  The rooms were OK and the wifi worked fine  
N =>  OK until the last day Stay someplace else It was OK   room was pretty clean  bed was actually comfortable  A little noisy  but that was temporary and not the fault of the hotel  The tribe upstairs was trying to get organized  I can t comment on breakfast as we were never awake before   am when it ends We were to check out on Monday morning at    am  On Sunday night I put out the Do Not Disturb on the door  At   am housekeeping banged  BANGED LOUDLY  twice  We were still asleep  I opened the door and there was no one there  but the cart was on the sidewalk  The Do Not Disturb was still on the door  I called the Front Desk and threw a screaming fit and they left us alone  We did not leave a tip for Hortencia  the housekeeper whose name was on the envelope left  quot for our convenience quot    Until that point I had planned to leave one    Also  Property Ops was fixing something in the room next door early Monday morning  and Jorge was blowing off the sidewalk when we left at     On Sunday night there were approx    total cars on our side of the hotel  The room next to us was booked to a noisy couple who came in at   am with a yappy dog  I d think there would be another room they could have been booked into  The hotel as a whole was OK for the price  but I wouldn t recommend it and I really don t think they care  
N =>  Not fancy but just great  The Best Western was clean and comfortable  There is nothing fancy here  but for a good night s rest it was great  The staff was kind  even telling us to let them know if we needed to stay longer than check out time  The pool was too cold to swim in  but we weren t planning on swimming anyway  Breakfast was good  we would stay here again on our way through Vegas  
N =>   No hot water    Had the most horrible stay  No hot water that lasted more than   minutes each morning  Complained to front desk  said they were aware of it  Never called to take care of it  At check out they said manager would contact me and they never did  Spoke to Corporate on arrival at home and they opened a complaint  They responded back to corporate said there water heater broke was fixed and that they contacted customers  What a lie  They were not willing to refund any of the stay  Corporate ended giving only a     travel credit  Per the conversation with front desk upon check out it almost sounded like this happens regularly when they are full  Never staying here again    
N =>  Not Bad   Not great Not a bad place if you want the North end of Vegas  Not near anything  Breakfast was good  We were lucky  we got to breakfast before the  quot crowd quot  The lack of space could be a problen  But all in all Nellis is clean  quiet most of the time  it s near the air base  
N =>  per chi vuole spendere poco a vegas basta prenotare con anticipo  
N =>   Stay Away The place was fairly clean  but         It s not in the best part of town  the room was very small  the bed was hard as a rock  the window blinds  amp  curtains were not enough to keep out the outside lights  They don t open their continental breakfast until   am  On the up side  the TV offered    channels including HBO  I wouldn t stay there again  
N => Location Location Location    of us stayed at Bill s       ember      We arrived mid afternoon  cab drops you off on Flamingo    second walk to check in  Check in   no line  no wait  amp  the receptionist even knew my name  We got rooms      amp       I was in      It was a partial strip view  which is free  a strip view is an extra     a night  As you can see from the photo it s a brilliant view  eiffel tower  amp  bellagio fountains  not sure a  proper  strip view is needed  Rooms are large  comfy bed  clean  iron  amp  ironing board   everything you need  Only downside was that there were roadworks right outside our room so it was noisy  However  earplugs sorted that out  And then exhaustion sorted it out the rest of the trip We didn t do much gambling at Bills but it s worth joining the players club as we still got a free t shirt  amp      off our hotel bill  Casino is a bit smokey but no worse than others  I think coming from England where smoking indoors is banned it s more noticiable as we re no longer used to it Had coffee every morning from Seattles Best Coffee in the hotel   good stuff  We also had breakfast in the Victorian Room one morning   really  really good eggs benedict  Loved the location   for the price  we paid        tax for   nights  you cannot beat this hotel  
N =>   Great hotel This was my second stay at Bill s and I love this place  Great location and the price is amazing for the location  It s a small hotel which is a real plus after a long day walking the Strip  Not having another long trek through the hotel to get back to your room will make your feet truly grateful The only complaint I had about my stay there is that the internet connection was erratic  It kept cutting out on me which is pretty annoying for a service you have to pay extra for  Cocktail service was also slower than it used to be but that seems to be common nearly everywhere now  It seems like everywhere has cut back on their waitresses Outside of these minor problems  it was a great stay  I d recommend it to anyone  
N =>   Big Budget Feel Low Budget Price This was without a doubt the most intriguing hotel we ve ever had the pleasure of staying in  If you ve read my other Las Vegas Hotel reviews  you know that my lady and I are slowly trying to stay at every hotel on the Las Vegas Strip  That s no easy feat when we both work full time  but we plan on being together for a long time I say this hotel was intriguing because I only  kinda  knew where it was  I knew it was near Harrah s and Bally s  but I could remember ever seeing it  I knew it must have been a pretty small hotel since there were only about three floors  However in the midst of all those super hotels around it  Bill s Gamblin  Hall and Saloon was ranked among the top    hotels on the strip  I had no idea how a hotel that small  across the street from the Bellagio and Caesar s Palace could be ranked that high then we got there This hotel is both off the grid and in your face at the same time  It s tucked away across the street from Bally s and offers more than meets the eye  Check in was swift and friendly and we found our room with ease  The motif is a Wild West Saloon with all the cowboy gear and animal heads you might expect from a Texas style steakhouse  The room was also very old west styled  but done in a very subtle enjoyable way  Not too imposing or over done  just right to where you re not afraid to touch anything  The room had a huge flat screen TV along with all the usual amenities you d expect  The view was one thing that stuck out in my mind above all  We didn t ask for anything special as far as our room  and I don t think we got anything extra  but from our room we could see the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower  It was a one of a kind bird s eye view of these two signature  outdoor Las Vegas attractions  The floor to ceiling window gave us a view of the strip we certainly didn t expect from this modest hotel  We didn t eat at the restaurant  but we did have some fun at the karaoke bar  It s not a huge deal  I m sure lots of places in Las Vegas have them  but for some reason I haven t seen a lot of karaoke bars around  This one wasn t anything special  but we had a great time  The hotel itself was great  but not tremendously memorable  I think our favorite thing was the location  You set foot outside Bill s and the entire center strip area is instantly a short walk away  For the location  the price is unbeatable making Bill s a triple threat  location  price and fun  The only downside to our visit is that we were quickly shuffled out right at       AM  We tend to count on sleeping in the morning we leave  but this time we weren t able to lounge about with a late check out  Needless to say  the Mrs  was not pleased  It s come to the point where we don t even think about whether or not we can stay till       or even       cutting an hour off of that was uncool  It put a bit of a damper on the end of our trip  but it didn t take away from the great time we had I highly recommend Bill s Gamblin  Hall if you re traveling on a budget and enjoy the center strip atmosphere  
N =>   Great place to gamble should ve stayed here Myself and a friend were in Vegas in  and went to most of the casinos  Bill s has a great atmosphere that you feel comfortable in  The dealers were friendly and happy to show us new comers how to play the different games  The free drink service was quite good but it did take the girls a while to get round  I would consider staying here if I ever got back to Vegas due to its central location on the strip  
N =>  Don t I repeat DON T stay here  Worst mistake of our entire trip  We arrived at midnight to Bills which is smack bang in the middle of the strip  and were greeted with a cloud of cigarette smoke as we walked in the side entrance near reception  We waited    minutes before someone came to the front desk to check us in  We went up to our room on the  nd floor to find we had been allocated a room with   queen beds   not the one king bed that we had booked  Surprisingly it was quiet  The beds were old and fell down on the edges meaning you could only sleep in the middle   but the middle also sunk down   not comfortable at all  but the least of our worries  The room had a massive TV  old worn out decor  a strange bathroom closet  and a small window with a grille on it  The carpet clearly had not been cleaned in years  and my socks ended up extremely dirty from just walking on it  The  non smoking  room was clearly a smoking room  as it stunk of stale cigarette smoke  and had a general old musty smell  In the morning we tried to shower  but instead of having a shower ended up being immersed in a bath half full of water  Clearly the bath did not drain  We complained about it at reception and were told it was unusual and assured they would get the engineer to have a look  The next morning when we went to have a shower  guess what  The bath fails to drain again and ends up filled with water  Again we went down to reception and complained  and were told that the maintenance log showed that the an attendant had been to our room and  fixed  the draining issued  The receptionist also added that most of the bathrooms in the hotel had the same issue  and that we shouldn t expect any better from a    year old hotel  As the staff couldn t guarantee that this would not happen in another room  we decided to check out  absolutely fuming by this stage  We found another hotel nearby for a comparable price for the rest of our stay   the other hotel was fantastic and of course all the facilities worked  We enjoyed the rest of our stay  and think that staying at Bills Gambling Hall  amp  Casino was the worst decision we made in our entire trip to the USA  Never ever would I recommend it Oh  and on one last thing  Bills charged a random sum of money of approx      to our credit card at some stage during our   night stay with them   they have still not refunded the money stating that they are unaware of the charge  The approx      neither reflects the initial deposit amount nor what should have been the total figure if we were to have stayed the full duration of our original booking  The charge was clearly identified as  Bills Gamblin Hall    exactly the same as the initial deposit  Of course it is being disputed They are just slimy  please  please please stay away  
N =>  Have never stayed anywhere else It is just too close to everything to not stay here    easy access to everything      min walk from parkade to your room    from your room to the casino    no line ups at check in or to get on and off of the elevator    Mike the bellman ROCKS 
N =>   We Loved Bills but bring Earplugs  We really enjoyed the   nights we stayed at Bill s  We had a King Bed room which was very spacious and true to the photos on Bill s website  The    quot  TV was nice  We were in room     and had a side view of the Bellagio Fountains  but it is such a short walk to stand right in front of the fountains from Bill s we found ourselves watching them every night with our    cent margaritas  The casino and the elevators tend to get a bit smokey  especially later in the evening  but the weather was nice and they had the large entrance doors open on both sides so I think that helped with the smoke  Another thing is you take two different elevators to get from the parking area to your room  One goes from the parking to the casino and then you have to roll or carry your luggage around this little bar to the other elevator to get to your room  Really not bad after seeing how long the walk to your room might be at some of the larger hotels  It is a loud and fun place to be  Just a word of warning   bring earplugs  We slept like babies with them  but if we did not have them we might not have been able to get to sleep  Get the soft foam type that expands when you put them in  very comfortable  We were on the second floor and could here all the shouting and laughter from the strip  They also have water guys on the bridge to Bally s and every few seconds we could hear them shout  quot Ice cold water only    quot  and they are always there  Went to sleep one night at  am and they were still there and it was cool outside  around    degrees  The location rocks   You can walk just about anywhere from Bill s and it takes just a few seconds to get out of your room and on the strip  We did drive to a few places like the Palms and Rio  Parking was great and driving the strip  even with the construction  was not as bad as we thought it would be  If you are driving from the strip  the hardest part is turning left into Bill s garage  but they have a light down the road so you just have to wait for it to turn red which will stop all the oncoming traffic I had good luck on their slots  I played penny machines and won           jackpots here and there  Not much for a high roller  but enough to keep me playing  Just be aware that some  quot penny machines quot  can cost you    a bet if you MAX BET We went to almost all the big casino s and Bill s just seems like the old school type  loud  roudy  lots of people smoking and drinking and having fun   a let your hair down type of place that we really enjoyed  Next time we are in Vegas we will stay at Bill s  One other thing we liked that the security personnel wore bright yellow shirts  no dark suits and hiding in the background like some hotels  We always felt safe at Bill s  
N =>   I love Bills  nd visit to Bills on Labor Day weekend        Room was great   Staff was very friendly   You can t beat the location   Great band playing in the lounge   we just had a great time   Won some money too    
N =>  Good value for money We stayed at Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon for   nights in ober       in room      a third floor room  with a view of the Eiffel Tower and a side view to the Bellagio fountains We thought this was a really good place to stay  The location was the reason we chose to stay here   you are right in the middle of The Strip  just across the road from Paris Las Vegas  the Bellagio and the Flamingo  I had asked for a room with a view to the Bellagio fountains and enjoyed watching them from our window  it wasn t the greatest view  but I enjoyed it   Although  be aware that they do make quite a lot of noise The room was clean  had air conditioning  which we were surprised not to need   a big TV  hairdryer etc  and use of an internet connection  you had to pay for this   It was a little dated and our room didn t get very much natural light  but was perfectly fine for the bargain price we paid We thought the casino downstairs was really fun too  in comparison to the other casinos we visited  They have free craps lessons ever morning which were really good  and at the end of the lesson you get a    voucher to use on the craps table when you bet     They have karaoke in the bar and Big Elvis singing in the afternoons  We did try out the restaurant  The Victorian Rooms  but didn t think it was great Overall  I thought this was a good place to stay at a very good price  I would definitely stay there again  and would recommend it to friends  I would highly recommend the craps lessons but would advise eating elsewhere  
N =>   Nice room at great price You can t find a more centrally located hotel  and it s worth paying extra if they have a Bellagio Fountain view room available  When we wore down from walking the stip  it was sure nice to just sit in our room and watch the fountain shows as well as all the other activities on the strip  Hotel guests have access to the Flamingos pool  and I don t think you could ask for a better pool in Vegas than that one  Negatives  hard to get in parking garage  inconvenient entrance from parking garage to casino to your room  nighttime road construction is tough to sleep through        day internet charge  
N =>   Fantastic Location OK Hotel Absolutely brilliant location for the price   right opposite Bellagio  close to Caesar s  amp  Flamingo  We were only there for    hours so it was perfect for being able to walk most places so quickly We arrived in Vegas at  am on a Friday and went straight to hotel   we had called before to ask for access to room on arrival but unfortunately they couldn t accommodate  didn t make promises on the phone either to be fair   No offer of other room shower to use in meantime so just had to leave bags with bell boy until  pm We had booked via lastminute com and didn t get chance to specify smoking room or not   ended up with smoking room unfortunately     They did offer to change the following day if we were that unhappy but the rooms were just about OK  corridor outside quite bad  Wished I had asked when called a few days before  However  we did get partial view of Bellagio fountains  which was great  As other s have said  rooms are nice  amp  big  OK bathroom  good flat screen tv  iron provided in room Taxi rank right outside for ride back to airport   cost about      We did trip to Grand Canyon  but no tour pick up from Bill s  we had to go to Bally s just opposite All in all  location totally outweighed the minor issues   perfect low budget hotel if you re happy just to visit the more glamorous hotels  amp  casinos  
N =>   We will be back to Bill s It was our first trip to Vegas and we were so pleased with our decision to stay st Bill s  I did all my hotel research on Tripadvisor and saw all the good reviews and knew it would be the place for us  We requested a room with a view and what a view  The fountains at Bellagio were soooo amazing to watch  The hotel staff was very nice and the Casino was a great place to start and end at  We are already planning our next trip back  
N =>   a Hotel with interesting character  smoky but good for solo traveler This is a  quot funny quot  hotel  Its one of those hotels that has its own personality and character  Not really sure how to describe it  Imaging Texas meets western cowboy meets old fashion victorian themes  The hotel is good  Not great but not bad neither  Its just  quot good quot   The staffs I encountered were super friendly  Made me feel very welcomed specially I was traveling along  The room was spacious     but a bit smoky  The whole hotel was smoky  But I was ok with that  Great location  Excellent actually   In the middle of the strip  Very easy to go around and visit all other hotels  Its less than    mins walk to the  quot O quot  show at Bellagio  which by the way  its the best show ever    I would stay there again if I am traveling by myself again  But I will not stay there if my family or my partner is with me  Its not very  quot family oriented quot  nor  quot romantic quot   Its just a good place if you are alone or travel on a budget  
N =>   Not bad    For the price you pay  its not bad    rooms are large  beds good   however  building is a bit old  hence problem with plumbing    
N =>   Still as good as ever Just back from my second visit to Bill s  Still fantastic value for money  access to Flamingo pool  amp  pool towels next door by showing your key card  right in middle of the strip from     a night Rooms clean and friendy atmosphere in the casino  Can easily wak to anywhere on the strip  For  nd time I had a view of the Bellagio fountains from my room  I think you have to have an even numbered room to have that view  otherwise you get a view of Caesars Palace  still not bad Will definately be back again  
N =>  A Bit Hazier But Still A Solid Value Not a whole lot has changed at Bill s since the last time I was here     and it was a good thing for not only me but my lady for whom this was her first stay  As my lady isn t up for a whole lot of walking  she appreciated the short commute from the room to the casino  front desk and even parking  I renewed my own appreciation for the reasonable rates   averaging     for our three nights   which included a    Strip view upgrade with a decent view of the Bellagio fountains  I found the room itself to be just as accommodating as before and my lady agreed  The bed was comfortable although the shower area of the bathroom can be a little tight  Perhaps in a nod to light to non gamblers  there was an increased if not quite abundant number of stations to choose from on the flat screen TV  We played sparingly in the casino  partially due to unusually high smoke entrapment  but on one relatively long  for us  slots session  my lady did pretty well on the quarters only to give it all back on the pennies  Meanwhile  I consistently contributed to Bill s bottom line  a nickel at a time The reason why this slot session lasted so long was because we waited about    minutes to be called in to dine at the Victorian Room coffee shop  While we did eventually enjoy our food  we decided it wasn t worth waiting around for  So we decided to order room service on the following mornings  Other than a    per person charge and a reasonable gratuity  the prices were essentially the same as the coffee shop  So the small splurge was worth it to us to be more flexible with our time  I still would not recommend Bill s for first time visitors looking for glitz and glamour  On the other hand  experienced visitors   especially the  sleep and shower  crowd   will appreciate the convenience and value of this Center Strip property  
N =>  Excellent experience We found Bill s to be clean  comfortable and friendly  We happened to be in a suite  which was large and full of character One downside   at dinner at Bill s Steak house  the food was great  but service was erratic  
N =>  Loved the location and ease of getting to rooms If you need a place to stay that s reasonable and convenient  this is the place  We only had to wait behind one person when checking in  Getting to our rooms was a breeze  so it was always convenient to stop by and freshen up  The beds were comfortable and the room was clean  The dark Victorian style is not my style  but I could live with it  We did not spend a lot of time gambling there until the end of our stay  but once we did  we enjoyed it  We did not choose to check out their restaurant  but we assumed it must be good because there were always people lined up and waiting  I think it was a nice  small place that was a great value  
N =>  Top quality at bargain price  We stayed at Bill s for five nights in ch       We arrived around   am and there was no problem checking in right away and no queues to check in either  We were offered our choice of a room with   queen beds or one king  we opted for one king and were given a HUGE room right at the back corner of the hotel on the top floor  I think it may have been part of a suite at some point as to get in you had to go through one door into a lobby area  off the lobby were two hotel rooms and a what looked like a parlour lounge area which was all locked up  Our room had a very retro feel  right down to a telephone in the huge bathroom The bed wasn t particularly well made when we entered the room  but I ve noticed this seems to happen sometimes with king size beds in hotels for some reason  Our room had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip which was cool A very loud alarm went off at  am one morning  some sort of fire alarm  warning us to  quot stay in our room until further notice quot  which was a little scary  Turns out water had got into the air con lines or something and triggered an alarm  Pretty minor inconvenience though The location of Bill s just cannot be beat  especially for the price  You can go from your room to right in the middle of the action on The Strip within two minutes  Also  as it is only a small hotel  there were no long lines to check in  which we noticed at some of the other hotels when we were exploring  You also don t have to drag your bags right through the casino to check in The staff were pretty good  except for one rude bellhop who yelled at us for pre ordering a taxi and then not showing up  when we d never ordered a taxi  we d only checked out and then headed outside to ask for a taxi right then Overall Bill s exceeded my expectations and is a great place for a cheap getaway to Vegas  
N =>  Unbeatable Location  Booked Bill s based on the reviews here   and they were pretty much spot on The location is perfect   in my opinion  as a first time visitor  this was the best section of the strip to stay at  A good thing about being in a smaller hotel was that you were no sooner walking out of your room door and you were onto the strip  Some of the bigger hotels seemed to take forever to walk from one end to the other  let alone up       floors in an elevator The room was better than expected  clean  very spacious and had a nice big TV  No fridge which is a shame  although I m sure not many Vegas hotels do provide one  No complementary internet  but at these rock bottom room prices you can understand why  Wireless  amp  wired internet was available at a extra cost  We had a great view of the strip from our window looking straight out at the Eiffel Tower   Air con was good  and kept the room cool despite the     degrees outside Most casinos in Vegas stank of cigerette smoke  but Bill s smelled the worst of the ones we visited  The room was fine  but the casino needed to do something about the ventilation  or give the carpets a good clean to get rid of the entrenched smell  No pool or gym but access to the Flamingos Pool was free  thankfully  due to the heat   and you received   free pass  Per person  to use the Flamingo s fitness centre Would definitely stay there again for the price   almost unbeatable value overall  
N =>   Better than expected  After staying w  family in a more expensive hotel  we decided to stay at Bill s for our last night to save money  Much better than expected   Nice LCD TV   better than the small thing at the  quot nicer quot  hotel  Great drink specials at the casino also  
N =>   excellent location Stayed for one nigth at the hotel on a quick break while on holiday on la  Hotel was easy to find and parking was very simple  took us a few minutes of walking around to find the check in desks but when found the staff were very nice and happy to check us in even thou it was only      am  The room was good  nice big tv if you have time to watch  we unfortunatelty didn t get a view of the fountains but the view of the side of flamingos was fine  The location was perfect especially as we only had    hours there    you couldn t really get more centraland for the price it was fab  Didn t really get the chance to use any facilities so can t comment  were planning on using the flamingo pool next door as it was   degrees  however after arriving it rained so gave up on the pool idea    it i also only open       I would recommend this hotel  
N =>   Great location brilliant value for money After reading the reviews about Bills we thought we d give it a try  We ve stayed in Vegas several times in larger hotels but thought this place was terrific  It s central location on the strip was spot on  The room was very spacious with a view of the Bellagio fountains  We were unfortunate to be there when some roadwork was going on in the night but we were too tired out to notice  Would definitely go back there as the price is very reasonable and also the parking was excellent  Straight off Flamingo Road  parked up near the lift  straight into the lobby  perfect  No hike with your bags like with the some of the other hotels  
N =>  Bill s Gambling Hall  ent Place for the Price I recently spent   night on the strip in Bills  I had a very good experience from Valet to check in  The room was large  clean  the furniture was Vintage style  Many have said it was  quot dated quot  but it is just not modern furniture  The WC was in the same room as the tub  the sink and clothes rack were seperated by a door to the bathroom  There was also a pocket door separating the entire bathroom from the bedroom The room consisted of a large comfortable bed  two night tables spaced about a foot away from the bed on each side    drawer dresser with a flat screen tv possibly a    in  There was a desk with a straight back chair  dining talbe with   straight back chairs  Wi fi was available  There was also one more chair in the corner  One think that I felt was lacking in the room was a stuffed comfortable chair  I enjoy sitting and relaxing in the room and not on the bed or a straightback chair I had a partial view of the strip but was opposite Ballys The next morning I went to the Victorian Room for a early morning  quot breakfast special quot   Food was good  but I felt        was high for eggs  bacon  toast  coffee and juice  The casino was laid out nice  and the Big Elvis show was entertaining  I would consider another stay at Bills in the future  and I will recommend it for someone wanting to stay center strip in a clean  small hotel  
N =>   Great location awful service My husband and I booked a non smoking room with a king bed online because there was a good price online  We arrive at the hotel and the front desk tells us that all non smoking rooms with a king bed are on one side of the hotel  which happens to be a strip view  which will cost     more per night  I say that we booked this room online and paid already  and she said that the websites don t take strip view into account  So we were charged an extra     because we were staying for   nights  If we thought we could get a room at another hotel for a reasonable price and not have to pay cancellation fees at Bill s  we would have left right then  We felt completely taken advantage of  Also  housekeeping left our door open one day  We came back to our room early in the evening and our door was open  Fortunately nothing was stolen  but when we went to go complain to the front desk  there was no one there to staff it  The room itself was okay  but there is no comforter bedspread on the bed  so if you get cold easily  bring a blanket  Also  one of the lightbulbs was out the entire   days we were there  internet costs     per day  and there are about   channels to choose from on your tv  This hotel is in a great location in the dead center of the strip  across from Caesar s Palace  and next to Monorail stops  In my opinion  the location is not enough to save this hotel  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else  
N =>   Nice Location but Room Needed Some Work Check in    stars Room      stars    room was dirty when we checked in and we had to wait for a maid to come clean room toilet was clogged and we had to call maintenance and he left the bathroom floor dirty sink had a crack in it  age  nice TVElevators    stars    only two but they were usually quick which made quick access to your roomLocation    stars    location was right in middle of strip but traffic was noisy people were handing out the stripper cardsBeach Pool   we did not use but had access to the Flamingo poolEntertainment   we did not go the Big Elvis show Casinos    stars    We did not play with equipment at Bills Lobby    stars    ok   Nothing spectacularThis was our first stay in Las Vegas  We were not overall pleased with Bills  but it is VERY convientant and if you do not desire high comfort amenities this might be the place for you  
N =>  Loved it We go to Vegas   or   times a year  We like to stay in the middle section of the strip  Had read some reviews on Bill s and was impressed thought I would try it  We booked the hotel with discount from players card so got a great deal  We got there  very small so easy to check in the lady at the front desk was very nice  Went up to our room and was impressed  We don t spend much time in the room  didn t ever even turn on the fancy TV but the beds were so comfortable and the room was CLEAN  I want a good bed and a clean room and Bills was wonderful  We ate at the Victorian and enjoyed it  We met some friends later in the week and moved over to Flamingo  we were so unimpressed with Flamingo we tried to go back but the rates were extremely high at that time  Next time I would definitely stay at Bills again  
N =>   Great location good price but not the nicest place in Vegas If you want to have a cheap place to store your stuff while you are out and about in Vegas  Bill s is the place  We didn t spend much time in our room  but that s the whole point of Vegas  right  Couldn t beat the price and location  Our room overlooked the Bellagio Fountains and was under     a night  not sure if that special runs all year   Got to use the Flamingo Pools which was nice  I suggest you walk through the parking lots instead of the hotels themselves  
N =>   Rude staff and No room service on my wedding night  My husband and I were in Vegas to get married  We booked   rooms at Bill s for a week  one for us and one for our   best friends  When we arrived and checked in  no one helped us with our luggage or even offered to  We got to our rooms  they were decent  nice flat screen t v  but they only got like   channels and most were spanish and news  After    min   when I went to smoke a cigerette I noticed there was no ashtray  I called the front desk and found out we were in non smoking rooms  I would NOT have booked non  smoking rooms  We definitley needed to move to smoking room  We were moved  but the front desk receptionist gave us such an attitude and told us we were in the other rooms for a long time and now the housekeeper had to do that room  Which is stupid cause we didn t even use anything but the garbage can and I even took that out when we moved  So after we dragged our luggage back down to the lobby and then back up to our new rooms we got settled in  The housekeeping was ok  they made up our room whenever we had the sign on the door handle to do so   That brings me to our wedding night  My new husband and I were enjoying eachothers company and decided to celebrate with a bottle of Jack Daniel s delivered to our room  that was listed in the room service menu for        service charge   I called down to room service to get that and charge it to the room  They put me on hold for a few seconds and then told me I could not charge it to the room  I m thinking that s strange since the room was linked to my credit card when I checked in  So  my husband went to the lobby to get some cash  When he got back I called room service again and it just rang and rang   noone answered  I tried back   min  later and they took the phone off the hook    When I finally got through they told me that with a huge attitude that I could not get that bottle of Jack up to the room because they  quot were to busy  quot     So  I asked if I went down to the bar  would it be the same price for the bottle as it says in the room service menu  She was like  quot honey  I don t know anything about that quot   That B didn t seem to know anything about much   So My husband and I got dressed and walked next door  all the way through the Flamingo to find a store  When we finally got back to our room  I hopped in the shower and then asked my new hubby to hand me a towel  There was none    housekeeping had taken the dirty ones and forgot to leave any  By that time housekeeping was closed and not open till the morning and I wasn t about to deal with the RUDE staff anymore that night  I had to air dry  So the location of Bill s is great  right in the middle of everything  But  the service is horrible and the staff is rude  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else  
N =>  Brilliant Location on the Strip Stayed here for    days  Fabulous location   opposite Caesar s Palace  Bellagios  amp  Ballys  Room was good size  amp  clean  We could see some of the Strip even though we had a side view  Ate in the Victorian Room for breakfast most mornings  amp  twice for dinner  The food was lovely  amp  there was a good selection  The breakfast staff in the restaurant were very friendly  amp  good  Due to the hotel being smaller than most on the Strip  there was no queuing at reception  There is no swimming pool but guests have access to the pool in the Flamingo next door which we used a lot  Great value for money  Highly recommended  
N =>  Can t beat the location for the price It was great staying at Bill s being right on the Strip within striking distance to everything  Another nice thing is from the casino floor  you can get to your room right away as opposed to the huge hotels where it s a    minute hike from front desk to your room  of course those rooms are a little fancier   The room felt a little old fashion  yet clean  It did have a fancy flat screen tv  yet they don t have HD picture which doesn t make sense  One drawback was our shower was a little slow to drain Not that they checked for our room key  but the Flamingo pool was wonderful  People everywhere  good or bad  and not a bad walk considering it is in a neighboring casino  Being a gambling beginner  Bill s was even a good place for us to gamble and drink on the cheap  Would definitely stay again at the price on a high priced  Vegas packed  big fight weekend  
N =>  They are small they are friendly they go out of their way they are perfectly located      Give them a try  We hadn t even heard of them until we saw an ad for them  I called and we made our reservations  They let us check in early  Their comps are good for food  souveniers  etc   We didn t pay for even one meal in cash   used our players club cards   Again  they are small  but just really helpful and friendly  They are located across the street from Caesar s and we had concert tickets there  We ll go back  
N =>   Good value and excellent location but some disappointments My husband and I stayed here for two night in ch      as part of a wider trip around the States  We paid an average of        plus tax per night for a standard king room  As other reviewers have noted  the hotel is in an excellent location in the middle of the Strip and the room was of a reasonably good quality and spacious  We were happy with and the level of cleanliness  Another reviewer commented that the bin etc was not emptied but we didn t have any problems with this   the service of the room was fine  and that their towels weren t changed   again we didn t have any problems with this  as with many other hotels in the area Bill s has a policy of only changing towels when you ask  ie indicated by placing them on the floor etc  to conserve water and we were happy to use the same towels for two nights Our one problem was that there was quite a bit of traffic noise but I am guessing that this is probably the case with a lot of Las Vegas hotels  Also we had requested a room with a Strip view and we did get one sort of looking sideways down towards Paris Paris but in retrospect it might have been better to get a back facing room that might not have had a view but might have been quieter We also made a couple of non local calls and were charged an exorbitant connection fee which was not made clear at all in the information about making calls that was provided in the room  be our own fault but I still felt it was very disingenuous not to make it clear to people   we left the hotel with a bad taste in our mouths and the feeling we had been tricked  This  and the traffic noise  is the main reason why I m giving the hotel three stars rather than four We didn t eat dinner at the hotel but we did have breakfast there one morning  cereal and fruit etc although cooked food was also available    it was OK but for the second more morning we realised it only cost a few more dollars to go to the all you can eat breakfast buffet at Treasure Island  or presumably other breakfast buffets   which was much better value  We d recommend the buffet at Treasure Island  we also had dinner there one night  as mid range ie while not the cheapest nor the fanciest it was good quality and had a wide choice While we were at Vegas we went on a day trip to the Grand Canyon with Papillon Tours  The one we went for included an aeroplane flight to the canyon  a helicopter tour  lunch at a local hotel and a coach tour to a couple of spots along the Canyon  I d definitely recommend this if you re short of time and don t have time to actually stay at the Canyon  
N => Couldn t have asked for better for the price  My husband  Bill  and I recently stayed at Bill s Gambling Hall  amp  Saloon from ch    to il    We chose this hotel in a package deal based on reading Tripadvisor reviews  We couldn t have asked for a better location  the staff  for the most part  was very helpful  friendly and efficient   from check in to check out  The room was nice   not the most updated bathroom but more than adequate  Our room was right in the front corner so we had an excellant view of the Bellagio fountain and the strip  My husband found this room a little noisy at night but I didn t mind it  Just a short walk to get on the Deuce bus      for unlimited use for   days   Excellent Prime Rib dinner at the Victorian Cafe for a reasonable price  though breakfast there was a little expensive  Didn t get to use the Flamingo pools but they looked beautiful when we walked through the grounds  Flamingo buffet was very extensive and reasonably priced   Tropicana s buffet was dreadful for the same price  This was our fifth trip to Vegas  and we have stayed at a different hotel each time  I would certainly stay here again  
N =>  Can t recommend this highly enough  We were delighted to arrive at this smaller hotel and find the location was right in the heart of the Strip  The check in was fast and friendly and the rooms very comfortable  We checked out to travel to the Grand Canyon  and when we returned  were upgraded to a suite which was amazing  The restaurant on site was very good but we suggest reserving a table early in the day as the value was so good  the tables were taken if you didn t  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Las Vegas  
N =>   THE Value play on the Strip Best bang for the buck  If you want easy access to your room when you re through playing without having to have a road map  this is the place  Quick and easy access to Flamingo  Bally s  Paris  Caesars  amp  Bellagio  The low price with the hot location means great value  Rooms good with    quot  plasma  good sized except for bathroom which was decent  clean  comfortable beds  quiet  Casino was active  sports book passable  bar specials good  slots fairly loose  amp  ok  Has enough amenities to satisy but this is a place to sleep  not party central  Famous Victorian Room has great food and graveyard specials     ribeye eggs   Good cocktail waitresses serving stout comp cocktails  Good place to unwind before hitting the sack  Great buddy hotel though missus might not be as impressed  Again  this is a value play   and the best on the Strip for its purposes  
N =>   Mixed bag some good lots of bad      First  the good things  Bill s has a great location  It s on the strip  next to the Flamingo and Bally s  The casino inside Bill s is on the small side  but had a good selection of video poker  slots  and card tables  The housecleaning staff does a nice job  our room was clean when we checked in and was kept clean throughout our stay  and was also friendly and courteous  Parking was free and convenient  Now  the bad  BE PREPARED FOR TROUBLE IF YOU BOOK THROUGH ORBITS  EXPEDIA  OR AN AIRLINE    We booked through Southwest  who uses Expedia or Orbits  and we arrived to find our reservation was not at the desk and they said our confirmation number was  quot not a real number  quot  We called Southwest who said they would fax over information for our reservation  The lady at the front desk said this would have to be approved by a manager  In the morning  we went to the desk and the lady there told us she was a manager but that they didn t accept reservations from Southwest and had trouble accepting them from Orbits and Expedia  She presented us with a paper to sign for our reservation that had room rates  x higher than we reserved through Southwest  We promptly told her we would not sign anything that did not have our promised rate on it  She was very rude and confrontational  Finally the airline sorted things out and we were charged correctly but what a hassle   As if our experience wasn t bad enough  at dinner that night we were standing in line to pay when the man in front of us told us that the dining manager just walked by and pushed him out of his way  We were dubious until he walked by and pushed everyone in line  one by one  out of his way saying  quot excuse me  quot  The purpose of saying excuse me is not to give you the right to push people  A simple  quot excuse me quot  without pushing would ve moved the people in his way  Finally he pushed a customer who cornered him later and told him that he did not appreciate being pushed  The manager threatened to call security  but several other customers spoke up and said they didn t like being pushed either  The housekeeping staff was amazing  but the managers were so rude and incompetent that I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone  They expect you to book through them and hassle you if you use another company  Clean rooms and cheap rates are available all over Vegas  save yourself the trouble and STAY AWAY FROM BILL S  
N =>   BE SURE to get your rates in writing      We were actually very excited about staying at Bill s  We had gambled there several times when it was the Barbary Coast  and read great things about the rooms on Trip Advisor  so we decided to stay there for ch Madness  When we looked at the rates online in ember  they were really good  We made our reservations and the lady on the phone told us to check back periodically for lower rates and they will honor them  Well  that is where it gets dicey  because they did not honor the rates they quoted me We booked   rooms for   nights each  but the reservation lady said that she couldn t email us confirmations  but instead gave us confirmation numbers over the phone  Please  please  please make sure to get written confirmation  We checked back every month to see if the rates had gone down  and they had  so we got the lower rates  each time confirming them for both rooms  The rates we ended up getting quoted were                 amp       for Wed Sat  We had to cut one room short as I was leaving early  so we reduced one of the rooms by one night  That is where the problems started For some reason  they changed the rate on the  nd room to       amp       for Fri  amp  Sat night  When we caught the error on our bill  they said that this was the avg rate for the weekend  and that they were not sure how we even got the rates we did for the other nights  They refused to credit us the difference and made it feel like it was our fault that they screwed up the rates  We called repeatedly to get the rates fixed  and kept getting pushed to one person that they all claimed was the  quot hotel manager quot   She refused to honor the rates that we had received months in advance and got defensive about it  saying it was our fault that we didn t get the rate in writing  When I said that I was told they didn t send out email confirms  she insisted they did  I travel quite a bit and get email confirmations all the time  I am not a novice traveler  I would have gotten one if I could have  She also continued to act like we were fortunate to get the rates we did  as she had no idea how we got rates that were so low  even though she said that they set the rates for the hotel  She seemed more eager to argue with me over the phone and sacrifice customer service over      As I said  get the confirmation in writing with your rates  or they will try to change them on you  
N =>   Clean room convenient location We booked a stay here based on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed  We upgraded to a  quot view quot  room for an extra     nightly and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio Fountains from our room  Clean rooms  friendly service  a quick walk to the strip  and a decent prime rib dinner for        make this casino a great place to stay  
N =>   Great location on strip but a dated property We spent only one night in Las Vegas  and wanted a place on the strip  We were six people  including four teenagers  I was lucky I called the hotel the day before our arrival  I had booked it three months before  and I wanted to make sure there would be room for all of us in the two bedroom suite  They had made a typo and booked me in ten days previously  and charged me as a no show  They were kind enough to acknowledge their error  and credited back my credit card  but could not transfer the previous charge to my hotel bill  They fortunately still had the suite on spring break  The property was a bit shabby  but the suite was good value for the strip  with about      square feet for the six of us  We really did not need all of that space and if I were to do it again I would have stayed in a cheaper place off the strip  The location across from Ceasars  diagonally from Bellagio fountains  and in walking distance to most of the mid strip places was very good  
N =>  Great Location But     We selected Bill s as our hotel based on all of the wonderful reviews the hotel received on this site as well as many others  The location was wonderful and I really liked how quickly you could get to your hotel room  The room itself was clean but a little worn around the edges  The bed was great except the sheets on the bed were a little scratchy  The sheets did not offer a lot of weight to them so it was difficult to get warm  it was unusally cool in Vegas   We were suppose to get a king room and they put us in a   queen room  When I called down to ask about getting a room change we were told there were none available  Only possiblity was a possible switch the nex day  I don t know about you but when I get unpacked I don t want to pack and unpack again the next day  We also ran into the issue of getting a boarding pass printed from the front desk  They sent us to this machine in the corner but it was not working  Again the front desk was less than helpful and gave me a paper to fill out to get a refund  I then had to call the company myself  using my own cell phone  to find out the issue with the machine was due to the connection within the hotel  We went next door to the Flamingo who printed us own boaridng passes for      bucks a piece  Not the best solution but they were friendly I would say all in all the floor workers were really friendly and the hotel check out on the last day was very pleasant but the other three days the front desk was less than helpful  
N =>  What a great location   We played at Bill s the last visit and decided to stay there for this visit  What a great location   It s a small hotel without the big hotel amenities   spa  pool  etc but it worked out great  Our room was basic   my husband said a  quot motel quot  room  I think it was nicer than that but not luxurious  We had a terrific view of Bellagio Fountains and the Eiffel Tower  We could even see the fountains from the shower  It was great   It was so nice to not have to walk forever to an elevator bank and then another hike to your room  It was right upstairs and our was almost at the end of the hall  We didn t hear any street noise and slept like a baby We ate breakfast at the VIctoria room several times  The food was good and good value We LOVED Big Elvis   He was the best  The gambling was good and it was a great time  We will go back to Bill s   
N =>  Good value but not so good service I stayed at this hotel just because I ve seen only great comments on this hotel in TripAdvisor  The check in and check out were great  We don t have to wait at all comparing to such a long lines I saw for Bally s   the opposite hotel  The elevator was a bit scary it took some time to open when you reach your floor  I was reluctant about pushing the emergency button at the first time but get used to it later  There is a free ice machine right next to the elevator which is awesome  The beds in my room are large which can fit three people instead of one for each  However  the bed make noises everytime I move so it s kinda annoying at night time  The soaps were given just once for your stay  The housekeeper did not give me extra even though they were so small in the later period of my stay  Also for the shampoo  conditioner and lotion   sometimes they were refilled and sometimes they were not  And even though they refilled them for you  the bottles were never been closed  They don t have shower caps  but there was a hair dryer in the bathroom  and adapter converter so you have to buy it yourself  I bought one converter from ABC store in Miracle Mile shops  The TV screen was huge I love it  However  I think they can improve more on their services in both housekeeping as mentioned above and the front office  They didn t seem very helpful to me and kept me waiting for their answers most of the time that I had to call to ask again The steak house at Bill s is kinda expensive compared to Victorian but the food there are great  
N =>   What s not to Like  Stayed at Bill s SuperBowl weekend  and what s not to like Clean friendly hotel with better than average rooms and service right in the middle of the strip  Rooms are decent size with comfortable beds and    quot  plasma TV  Inexpensive rates and not to mention takes about a minute to go from room to street  Have to love the stain glass windows in the bath that open to the strip side street  Where else in Vegas are you going to find this  ent Blackjack conditions compared to some of the huge resorts and friendly dealers  great people watching also due to Drais  Treat yourself to a cup of Seattle s Best coffee in the morning for some great people watching as patrons leave Drais 
N =>   Excellent price   excellent location The whole review from the individuals from Australia described our experience exactly  We also chose this hotel based on previous reviews and we were not disappointed  I contacted the hotel directly after seeing the prices for room rates on the internet a few months previous to our travel and booked directly with the hotel rather than online with no issues  I noticed about one month prior to travel that the room rates were        USD lower than what I had booked during the same time period  I called the hotel and it was not an issue to get the lower rate for our stay  This allowed us two rooms for basically the price of one which meant  no sleeping with our young adult sons   Noise   was our only issue  Our room was on the street side   it helped to leave our bathroom door shut at night and earplugs cut out the rest of the noise  Our boys who were across the hall said they had no noise issues  We stayed at this hotel for five nights  There was security present  outside the elevators  on only two out of the the five nights although we didn t find it an issue other than some late night  loud guests going to their rooms  The rooms were spacious and clean  The location is excellent and we were pleasantly surprised with not having to pay for parking our car  There was always plenty of parking available  The purpose of our trip was shopping and shows  not gambling so the location of this hotel was ideal for both  It was great to have a car as we went to both outlet malls to shop  Yes  there is no fancy reception area but from reviews of other hotels it sounds like you spend a lot of time in line ups   checking in out  We were the only ones at the desk to check in as well as to check out   no line ups here  The pictures on the website are exactly what you get  I was impressed that with the amount of smoking in the casino that there were no odors in the rooms  We requested non smoking rooms  This hotel doesn t have the amenties that some of the bigger ones do but during ruary you won t be swimming in the pool anyways  I understand that guests would be able to use the Flamingo Pool next door when it is open  
N =>   Best Little Deal in Vegas Staying at Bill s was overall a great experience  Parking our rental car was so easy  No walking for miles to get to your car or valet parking  Check in was done within   minutes  I had mentioned it was my husband s   th birthday  so they gave us an upgrade when we checked in   PLUS they price had been going down so from the time we booked until the time we checked in they had price matched   we saved      for the three nights   A window room  overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains  Traffic noise was a little bit of a hassel but we got over it pretty quickly  The room was great  A little old  but definately not ragged  Very Clean  An awesome hugh flat screen tv was an added plus  We had the        Prime Rib deal the first nite and even brought some extra rolls to our room  Hubby won      the first night in the casino     Blackjack tables  Big Elvis was free in the lounge  Of all the casinos we went to it BY FAR was the best place to get free drinks  They go above and beyond to make you feel special  
N =>   Another great stay  My husband and I have stayed in most of the hotels on the strip over the past ten years or so  On our short  quick trips of   or   nights  we like to sometimes stay somewhere cheap where we can get in and out without walking a mile from your room  Bill s is exactly that place We ve stayed at the hotel when it was Barbary Coast several times  This was our first stay since Harrah s took it over and it became Bill s  We checked in about    PM and was in our room in a matter of minutes  We had a non smoking room on the Flamingo side of the hotel on the  th floor  It was super quiet  so if you go to bed early or just don t like the noise of the strip in your room  ask for the Flamingo side  Even by the elevators  we really didn t have any trouble Room amenities are very basic  but very clean  We love taking our shower with the little window open  A C is COOOLLLDD  good thing in y  but In uary     We love to gamble at Bill s  It s cozy and you can be to from your room in seconds  It s also great when one of you needs to go up to the room and you can easily find your other half when you come back   unlike the big casinos  Comps were pretty good and our room meals ended up being free  Try the Wizard of Oz machine closest to the entrance to Drai s  I wish I could have brought it home with me   it was very good to me  and others while I was there  We always eat at least once at the Victorian room if we stay there  It s not as good as it used to be when it was Barbary Coast   no more coffee cake brought to you     but it s still good  The chinese food is actually VERY good  Better than PF Chang and the like No trouble getting a cab when we left to fly home  It was a quick    night stay  but lots of fun  Wouldn t hesitate to recommend this to anyone  especially if you aren t in the room much  
N =>   best kept secret of the strip great location in Central Strip  amazing rooms  great view of the strip  large  hi def TV  small hotel and casino so you can park and be in your room in less than   min  as opposed to most strip hotels where you have to walk almost    min just to get to you car from the room  good security  they don t let non hotel guest into hotel elevators i will always stay here when i go back to vegas  
N =>   Great Location The location is the main point for staying at Bills The rooms are fine  amp  reasonably sized  There is a clock radio  amp  hairdryer and bathroom with shower  smallish tub alongside a vanity unit  dressing area There is a    inch plasma TV in the room  I do not have a TV at this size at home  amp  personally would have preferred a room safe  amp  coffee maker to be provided but each to his own     I didn t use the steakhouse  as I didn t think it particularly reasonably priced  But the Seattle coffee shop is handy for a light breakfast The place was clean but some of the carpets  amp  linen had seen better days  I stayed for eight days  amp  only had one top up of shampoo  amp  soaps My room did not have much of a view  just overlooking the side of the Flamingo  but did mean it was relatively quiet  Some  but not all  of the staff on reception were not overly helpful  When wanting to book the airport shuttle I was just given a phone number  amp  left to call myself Another thing   amp  not exclusive to this hotel  was the cost of phone calls from the room  I made one quick call within the US  amp  was charged     
N =>  Not dissappointed This was our first trip to Las Vegas  and we used Trip Advisor and traveler reviews to plan our trip  Our stay at Bill s was just what we expected  It s location could not be better  The Staff was friendly and helpful  We loved the fact that the hotel is smaller and easy to navigate  Most important our rooms were clean and quiet  The in wall air conditioning unit is a plus for us  It gave us  quot white quot  noise for sleeping and good control of the temperature  Being our first trip  we visited every casino on the strip  The size of each of them was almost overwhelming  It was a pleasure to come  quot home quot  to Bills  We do not need fancy  just comfort and that s what Bill s gave us  
N =>  Fantastic Location  I decided to book this hotel for part of our stay in Vegas during our honeymoon  after reading some of the reviews from other travellers  I have to say  we were not disapointed at all  Fantastic location  right in the middle of the strip  across from Ceasers and the Bellagio  we could even see the fountain show from our window The rooms were large  and clean  and they provided a coffee maker upon request  which not many other hotels in Vegas seem to do  The best thing for me was the fact that you could be from your room  to the Strip in   mins  unlike some of the much larger hotels where you seem to get lost on the Casino floor trying to get in or out If you are looking for a good deal  in a great location on the Strip  you can t go too far wrong with this place  Why spend all your money on a fancy hotel room  that you will spend no time in  Spend it on a show instead  
N =>   Good Value We just got back from Las Vegas and we stayed at Bill s  We had no problems what so ever  quick check in and room was clean and comfortable  We asked for a coffee maker and fridge ahead of time but it was not in our room when we arrived  When asked again  they brought them both up immediately  We had to leave a note for the housekeeper to leave coffee though  no big deal  What I liked about Bill s was the fact that they had security by the elevator and you had to show your room card in order to get up to your room  first time we have ever had to do that in Vegas  and I liked that   felt safe there  If you are looking for a hotel that is clean  comfortable and good value for your money  stay at Bill s  If you are looking for frills  keep looking  
N =>   Bargain getting ragged Bills  formerly Barbary  quot Coast  used to be one Las Vegas s best bargains   low room costs  big rooms  large plasma TV  and good location near Bellagio Paris  friendly staff  low minimums on the tables  On this trip  though  the property was starting to look a little ragged  subpar housekeeping  and minimal ammenities  My room  on the strip  was exceptionally noisey  As rates in LAS are coming down  I think this may be my last visit  
N =>   Avoid this hotel   horrible customer service  Note that this hotel has a    hour cancellation policy  If you can t make it there for any reason  a death in the family  airport shuts down due to bad weather  or whatever   they could care less and are very rude   you will still pay for it  We booked this hotel on their internet site on Wednesday for Friday night  less than    hours in advance   We tried to cancel it on Thursday  more than    hours before we were supposed to check in   We hadn t noticed their cancellation policy of    hours but they said they were still going to charge us unless they sold out all of their rooms  including ours   last   Lucky for us it was a busy night   Halloween  and they only had   rooms left  Friday morning we had a phone message saying they had rented all the rooms including ours and would not charge us  However  when I got our credit card statement they still had charged us the full amount  Our room rate wasn t a discounted in any way and it more than most of the big casinos were charging for the same night  but we booked it anyway based on high reviews here  The credit card company won t dispute it for us b c we only had a verbal agreement that they wouldn t charge us for a room that someone else stayed in and paid for  They got paid twice for one room  which has to be illegal  
N =>   First time to Vegas  I stayed here during my first trip to Vegas  I had no problems checking in  My room was quite adequate in space and had two seating areas  The beds and pillows were comfortable  Most importantly it was clean  My room faced Bally s and the noise didn t bother me  it s Vegas  Every employee of this hotel was kind and courteous towards me  I ate at the Victorian Room more than once  the prime rib was good for the price  the staff was quick and efficient  This was the perfect choice for my first trip to Vegas  I was not overwhelmed as I would have been staying in a larger hotel  The hotel itself is in a wonderful location  I will definitely be back  
N =>  We love Bills Gamblin  Saloon      Great location on the Strip   right in the heart of everything  There is a bus stop right outside the Flamingo hotel  right next door  which takes you to some great shopping outlets etc Hotel itself was easy to find as we were driving  Car Parking at hotel was very good Check In was hassle free and quick and check out was just as easy Hotel Room was excellent  It looked like a English Victorian Room with a king size bed  We had a brilliant view of the Strip  We could actually stand in the shower and look at the fountains at Bellagio s    We ate at the Victorian Room within the restaurant  The food was great  however the service was OK  But it didn t dampen our stay here  as we would definately recommend this hotel for a Vegas Stay  A sensational hotel for the price in a great location We love Bill s      
N =>  Wall Map in Break Room STAT  While the margarita s are flowing in the back and the cheap tables are always busy      the security in the Casino here needs an Atlas  My sister and A friend of mine was asked to produce ID when they sat down to play some machines while waiting for the rest of our group to get their cheap drinks  We re from Canada so my sister produced her British Columbia ID  it was nodded at and given back  My friend gave the  quot night manager quot  her Saskatchewan ID and was told  quot looks fake  never seen this before  you re going to have to leave quot       We were flabbergasted  Do these people asking for ID ever pick up an atlas or a world map  Heck a map of North America would have been helpful  Saskatchewan is NOT a made up place  lol and we re no spring chickens  needless to say  we took our gambling money elsewhere  
N =>   Great location We stayed at Bills for three nights for our first trip to Las Vegas and found the location ideal as it was right on the strip Our rooms were on the Flamingo side of the hotel and were fairly quiet  The room rates were fairly cheap but there were a few negatives like no refrigerator and no cofee and tea making facilities We had breakfast in the Victoria room one morning but found the food was a bit ordinary so went to the Paris breakfast buffet which was quite good and very popular  Went to Bills steakhouse on the last night and found it to be a bit expensive   The prime rib        special in the victoria room would have been a better option  Our next trip to vegas we would more than likely stay somewhere else  We felt like we got what we paid for but may have been better off paying a little extra for a hotel with more facilities available  
N =>   disappointing Having read all the good reveiws on this hotel i was a little disappointed in Bills It is in a great location but the hotel is average The rooms are large but outdated  ours absolutely stank of cigarettes The restaurant was not good  service was slow and the food was tasteless  It was quicker to go the bar and get your own drinks than wait for the one waitress to get to your table The casino was friendly and not intimidating like some of the bigger hotels The drinks were very cheap in the bar compared to the surrounding hotels There were no queues to check in and theres an optional     per night up grade for a room that overlooks the Bellagio Fountains  The rooms are exactly the same and not worth it I wouldnt recommend Bills to anyone i knew visiting Las Vegas and wish we d paid a little bit extra and stayed at one of the bigger hotels  
N =>   Bad experience at Bill s  had to sleep on the floor After reading the glowing reviews here  I booked three nights at Bill s for my goddaughter  her boyfriend  and myself  Two days before our trip  I called Bill s and asked if there would be any problem getting a non smoking room with two beds  plus a rollaway cot   even though we d be arriving at about midnight  I was assured there would be no problem When we arrived  I was given a key card by a bored and eventually quite rude desk clerk  Upon finding that the room had  one  bed and was  not  non smoking  I called the desk guy  who told me that we had no guarantees since we booked through Travelocity and that he would send up a rollaway  The bellman arrtived    minutes later with the news that all the rollaways were being used  and all he had for me was some blankets and a pillow  I asked the desk clerk to get us a different room somewhere  and he said that was impossible and all I could do was speak to the manager the next day  After also trying and failing to get through to someone at Travelocity  I gave up and went to sleep on the floor  as we had a full day planned for tomorrow When I spoke to the manager the next day  she apologized and said our reservation had been  quot screwed up quot   She upgraded our room to a non smoking double with a side view  big deal  but said that s all she could do After getting home  I contacted Travelocity and asked for a partial refund  After some time  they told me Bill s had  quot met their obligation quot  to me  had provided a rollaway on the first night  and had upgraded us for the rest of the stay  so no refund was possible  I reiterated that they did  not  provide a rollaway  that the manager had admitted that the reservation was screwed up  and the so called  quot upgrade quot  was insufficient compensation for having to sleep on the floor  Travelocity finally agreed to refund the money out of their own pocket   I waited for all of this to happen before posting this review  I will never stay at Bill s or  any  other Harrah s property again  unless I m comped to one   I will also be very wary of booking through online services  although this was the first time something went wrong this way  I know this was a fluke experience  but   buyer beware  
N =>   What a Gem   Like most other reviewers  I was totally impressed with Bill s  It s location is second to none  The staff were uniformly pleasant  It literally was two steps from the front desk to the elevator  I did not find the casino particularly smoky  And I did like the fact that there were security personnel on the property  and roaming the floors  throughout the day  I just do not know of a better lodging hotel in the mid Strip area that compares to Bill s  I would highly recommend it to anybody wanting to stay on the Strip not wanting to pay megabucks for a room  
N =>   Great Hotel Excellent Holiday We chose bills as we wanted a very central hotel but not a huge price tag  Bills fits the Bill We were very impressed with the room  all you need for a base and a place to rest your head after a long day and nite in vegas  If you want glitz and glam  then Bills is probably not for you  but if you want a central  clean  cheap and good hotel room with access to a huge swimming pool and a fun little casino then check it out We had a large room with king sized bed  a good bathroom with a powerful shower  albiet it a low shower   and a great view of the strip and the bellagio fountains which was really nice   how much would you have to pay for a stay at the bellagio with a view of the fountains    Everything was clean and the maid service was good  always fresh towels and toiletries etc  The only negative would be that the air con is sooooo loud  but works a treat   and also if you have a low floor strip view room the noise from the street can be loud but you cant complain   you re in vegas and not meant to be sleeping   We also thought bills was a good deal as you can use the huge pool at the flamingo  but we only managed to get there one afternoon as we had too much else to do while we were there  It was ok but very over crowded and the drinks we really over priced but we had a fun afternoon The casino can get a little smoky and the carpets are worn on the entrances which give it a less than appealing feel  but we thought bills was great  Cocktails came frequently     cent margaritas were great and big elvis really is BIG I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again if im lucky enough to get to vegas again   
N =>  Good Place Stayed at Bills for two nights  Room was comfortable and clean  Maid service was very good  Was in room     with excellent southern view toward Bellagio  No noise problems other than the occasional EMS vehicle  garitas were so so  Victorian Room had solid food  nice staff with excellent service  Slots were tight  Plenty of winners at Craps though  Regular crowd sometimes can look a little seedy  but there were no issues at all  Other hotels had some fights  expulsions  etc  Everyone at Bill s was courteous and responsive to inquiries  
N =>   locationlocation location  This was our second stay at Bill  We stayed   nights  If you want a big hotel Bills is not for you  It has every basic thing you need for a comfortable stay  As mentioned by others you can use Flamingo pool which is very easy to get to  Love the fact you can easily  amp quickly get to your room  amp  car  as well as walk out the door  amp  you are at the center of the strip  Room prices were great  We paid         week days   When we first booked the rooms by phone thru Bills directly  the rates were higher so I called them back  twice   amp  they adjusted our rates  Staff was very helpful  We had excellant rooms on the fourth floor with fountain views  Only thing I would add would be an in room safe  amp  a coffee maker  Minor things  Would most definately stay again  
N =>   Bill s is great value on the Strip We were in Las Vegas for a weekend wedding  Given Bill s rating on TripAdvisor and its reasonable cost compared to other Strip properties  we booked our stay at Bill s It was great to walk through the doors on Flamingo Road and be at the check in counter in about    seconds  The elevators were right nearby  and it took us only about a minute or two to get to our  st floor  above the ground level  room  We had a room near the southeast end of the hotel  so we were able to see Bally s  the top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris  and a bit of Bellagio out the window The room was clean  The bed wasn t as comfy as a Heavenly Bed at Westin  but it was okay  The bathroom area was a little small  but it was perfectly fine  The shower head was a little low  but we re not excessively tall  so it wasn t a big deal There was a nice wall mounted    quot  plasma TV  biggest TV I ve had in a hotel room The hotel is nicely situated on the Strip  And the casino was small enough that even when we walked all the way through the casino to get to the elevators  we never felt tempted to gamble  Sorry  Las Vegas  we didn t spend a penny in any of your casinos Compared to the loooooong  tortuous walks we took through the Flamingo  Caesar s Palace  and Planet Hollywood  a relatively tiny place like Bill s was great  We loved it  and we ll happily put Bill s on our list of hotels to consider the next time we go to Las Vegas  
N =>   Not a mega hotel and casino but great for the price and location On previous Vegas trips  Bill s was always a place we went to gamble from our larger hotels because of the fun atmosphere and cheap drinks  Since this was our  th time to Vegas  we decided to stay a few days at the hotel itself  and it was a good experience  We arrived a little before check in time and were able to get our non smoking room without a problem  The room was a good size and very clean  The bathroom was small  but also very clean  The shower head was a bit low  I am only     quot   and it drained slowly  but we were paying low rates for two nights  so any small issues didn t bother us  The beds were comfortable  The only other issue was light coming through the bathroom at night due to a window  so we closed the bathroom door   Yes  we actually did sleep a bit in Vegas  We ve always enjoyed the casino on previous trips  and you are right next to the monorail and several other big hotels if you care to experience something else  The Flamingo hotel gives you access to the pool there Overall  we enjoyed our stay at Bill s  We did miss the excitement and grandeur of the bigger hotels  but if you are looking for a short  cheap getaway  Bill s is a great choice  
N =>   Terrible experience  My husband and I booked this hotel based on the reviews posted on TripAdvisor  Boy  did we have a different impression and experience than some of those posted here  While the room had newer art on the walls it wasn t enough to detract from the poor quality of the furnishings  doors  sinks  etc  Items were well worn and rather depressing  Despite this  we settle in only to have a fire alarm go off in our room  We called the front desk and they said it was a problem caused by the local fire department  However  it continued about every    minutes for the first hour we were in the room  In addition to the alarm there would periodically be an announcement that the alarm we just heard would be explained  It never was  Finally  my husband called the front desk and said we would be checking out and asked for a refund  Management did refund our money and we went to the Palazzo  For     more a night than our room was at Bill s  we got a      square foot suite with impeccable amenities in a first class establishment  I would strongly recommend against staying at Bill s unless you have no other choice  
N =>   A Home away from home    Beautiful Resort to stay in   I really felt as if i was in CanCun  the pool is huge  amp  so nice  My room was almost the size of my house  I love the Comfortable bed  huge bathroom  very nicely decorated  calm relaxing environment   amp  excellent price  Absolutely loved it  amp  will definitly stay there again   
N =>   Not too bad            Before we went to the Cancun resort we read here how unfriendly the staff was  we didn t run into that at all  They were courteous and helpful at check in and assisted us with printing our boarding passes before we left  The condos themselves  at least the two bedroom we had  are smaller than the other condos where we have stayed  It was very clean though and quiet  But then this is Vegas and how much time are you going to be at your condo  The pool was absolutely beautiful but we couldn t figure out while the temperatures were in the mid    s to low     s the water felt as if it were about    degrees  We were not the only ones that thought the water was too cold  A couple of nights we did hear a few people that had been celebrating a little too much as they returned but only lasted a couple of minutes  and not that long after we returned for the evening  The resort is less than    minutes from the strip  we didn t use the shuttle at all and found that if you use back streets you can get to some of the parking decks at the casinos without having to deal with all the traffic of the strip  If you want to get away from all the glitz and glamour of the strip take a trip up to Freemont Street  Its old Vegas and is much more laid back than the strip and found it to be a pleasant change  Overall it is a nice resort and would return here again if we ever travel to Vegas again  
N =>   unfriendly front desk personnel We are owners at this place so when we got there  the  obnoxious  front desk people told us that our rooms weren t ready   check in is at      and it was past   close to       the lady did not apologized and did not care to please us in any way  So we waited over two hours   We asked for a key to the pool  at least the kids could get wet while we waited  They finally gave us one of the rooms  except the penthouse and the other room  so when they finally informed us that the room was ready  i went to get the key  The lady wanted to see an i d    are you serious   did not bring one with me it was in the car    She refused to give me the key  After the two hours  you d think they d be more friendly  at at least understanding   Nope  i asked to speak to a supervisor  and he too was an a   hole  After what it seemed an eternity  he asked for several personal information and reluctantly gave me the keys   the next day i needed to print something out from the place they have and on the computer it said i needed to buy a card from the front desk    so here we go again    all i needed to know was the minimum of minutes i needed to buy to use the internet okay  So one of the clerks is on the phone and I stood in front of her to ask her the question nothing  A gentleman came over and called the next person in line  I approached him and said   quot i just have a quick question quot  and he said  quot  There is a line quot    Yes  there was a line  but they all had cards  as if they were ready to check out  I left  
N =>  Worst hotel experience of my life  If I could give it a negative number I would  Let me just start by saying this trip was supposed to be one to celebrate my husbands birthday  last year he was serving in Iraq for his birthday   a getaway to make up for the honeymoon we never got and a time to meet up with my extended family  including my brother who left to deploy the day after we got back   We were very much looking forward to this trip  We were staying in a two bedroom with a pullout couch with a total of three couples arriving at three different times  Arrangements had been made by my cousin  the timeshare holder  for this resort to be in my name so we could check in a day earlier than she and her spouse  Upon arrival  the hotel could not find our reservation  It took them    mins and lots of us and them calling around to find it  Once they finally did we were let into our room  After running around and finally getting settled in my husband and I decided to sit down and have a nice quiet night and watch a movie  We first noticed buttons were missing off the actual tv but didn t think much of it  But then when I went to pick up the remote  the batteries flew across the room because there was no back on it  I decided it wasn t that big of a deal and went on  We then proceeded to try to watch a movie only to find the dvd player was broken and making a huge loud popping noise  We called the front desk and they sent someone up  It took him running back and forth to find a new dvd player and an hour to hook it up  The next morning my husband opened the dresser to put our clothes away only to have our dresser fall apart  We again called front desk and they sent maint again  After trying for a while to fix it then leaving and coming back he decided he couldn t fix it and had to find another one The first morning after my cousin arrived  she woke to roll over and find a pair of mens underwear that did not belong to anyone in our party  We immediately called the housekeeping to notify of her findings only to have them tell her they must belong to her husband  She then hung up and called the front desk to complain of all the issues building up and also to let them know of the panels that are coming off the wall near the balcony of our wonderful view of the parking lot  They said it being memorial day weekend they could only move us to another room and have no other sister hotels to send us to or rooms to upgrade us to  We had to then pack up all of our belongings and groceries we had bought for a week and move everything to a completely different building  The hotel did not even offer to help  They only thing they could do to make up for it was a dinner off site  we refused to eat at their horrible restaurant   Which when it came time for us to get our vouchers and go to dinner they were not at the front desk  So they had to track down the GM to get them  All the while we missed the shuttle and had to pay for a taxi  We also had her comp us a few drinks at the pool but she was not happy about having to do both  Our room had two bathrooms  so one bathroom was shared by four people  Knowing this  housekeeping still only gave us enough towels for two people  The bedrooms do not have any fans and the air barely worked in our room so my husband and I sweat it out every night  We had the ac on the lowest it would go but still nothing  After sleeping in our new bed my husband and I both noticed we were itchy  We didn t think much of it until after the next night when we were both bright red and covered in hives  We had welts all over our bodies that itched like crazy  I called to the front desk and they said we must just be allergic to their detergant and that it wouldn t help to get new sheets  It did not seem very likely to us that we were both allergic to the same detergant and that we were fine in the first room but not his one  I told her to send the sheets anyways  When we got home we noticed they brought new sheets but rather than put them on they just left them on the table near the door  After we put the new sheets on the day we left we finally started to get better  The shuttle was nice to have but only runs until midnight  So you do not get a ride home if you plan on going home late  All the drivers had different rules and if there were a lot of people waiting you had to wait for the next time which could be an hour  A taxi back to the hotel is a minimum of     but will often run you double that with the traffic  We had to use the taxi more often then planned because they had one shuttle broke down so rather than the    min wait time they advertise  you wait more like     I will say that they nicest people we came across were two of the shuttle drivers  The restaurant at the pool is awful  They are incredibly overpriced  The chicken wings were very over priced and I must say the worst I ve ever had  The frozen margaritas out of the machine were great though  But did cost you      The pool is large and has water slides but it got extremely crowded on the weekend  There were not enough chairs for people  but plenty of room where they could have bought them  I guess the hotel was too cheap for that  We had six people in our room but were only allowed to check out one pool float per room  They had a cookout for the weekend that we decided to purchse food from  We went to the food only to find you must go to the restaurant on the other side of the pool area to stand in line to purchase tickets then come back to the food to stand in line to get your food  We did this and when it was our turn to get our food they ran out   They were not sure if they would get anymore  but finally came up with some    minutes later  The only reason we were able to get food was because we happened to walk up and check to see if any was there right before it had once again run out  The organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace  After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare  I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE  This is the worst hotel on the market  I am highly disappointed  Especially after reading so many great reviews  I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop  I think you get the point  It was awful and completely ruined our trip  Oh and my husband and I just finally got our hives  redness and severe itching to go away today   one week after being home  DO NOT stay here      
N =>  Short but pleasant trip After visiting San Francisco for two nights  my wife and I came to Las Vegas and the Cancun Resort for two nights  before heading home and me going back to Baghdad  We were greeted very warmly at the front desk and received our room promptly  After checking in  my wife complained that the room had a funny smell and housekeeping came quickly to check and spray the whole suite with deodorizer which took care of the problem  The one room suite was a little on the small size  with a very cramped kitchen  bedroom and living room  but the bathroom was very roomy  The Jacuzzi tub didn t have a stopper  so we were only able to take showers  but that was no biggie  The furnishings seemed a little dated and worn  but serviceable  We had reserved a car through a family friend employed by one of the major car rental companies and they couldn t find our reservation  so we wound taking a taxi to the resort  The concierge was very helpful in arranging a car at a good rate through Enterprise for us for a day  so we could take a site seeing trip to Hoover Dam  The rest of the time we used the shuttle service  which was adequate  although not as timely as advertised  The driver actually remembered us from one day to the next  and was very helpful in getting us to the show we were going to see and getting us back to the resort afterwards  We didn t have a chance to use the pool as it was a little cool the few days we were there  but it did look very nice  As posted on previous reviews  there was a lack of information in the room  and we could not find an internet connection  for free or a fee   something we have gotten used to when staying at other hotels  We reserved the room through a family member who is a timeshare member and used his points  so overall the value was average  I ve stayed at much higher priced name brand hotels and received less satisfaction  I ve also stayed at lower rated hotels which were better  
N =>   Park Bench Sofa Concurring with other reviewers  the place is ok  but calling it a  quot Resort quot  is definitely a stretch  I was there to attend a trade show involving serious walking every day  Coming back to the room and sitting on their furniture was literally painful   I had to grab pillows from the bed to soften the sofa somewhat  It was best to relax on the bed instead As mentioned by other reviewers  the kitchen is a postage stamp  the coffee brewer way too yucky to think about using  no exhaust fan in either bathroom  anybody gotta match    and limited garage parking  I also have a big problem paying additional fees     day  for internet access  The place has more of a motel feel  although all of the motels I stay at DO have free internet  than a  quot Resort quot   
N =>   Great Hotel We are a family of   from Australia visiting the States for the first time After doing lots of research on where to stay in Las Vegas and after reading reviews  we decided the Cancun Resort would best suit our family We were pleasantly surprised how nice this hotel was and how great the price was  It was also a plus that it was a non smoking hotel Our booking was for a   bedroom unit  One bedroom contained a king size bed with a bathroom and the other bedroom had a queen bed  There was also a second bathroom  dining table and a fully self contained kitchen  The living area contained a fold out sofa bed  There was also a balcony to look out over the strip  Our unit was kept very clean Each floor of the hotel had a laundry service room so we were able to wash our clothes very easily after all our travelling This hotel had a fanastic pool area which would be great in summer  but the weather was a bit too cool for us when we were there Staying at this hotel gave us easy excess to the strip as it was a    minute drive to any of the casino s  if there was no traffic jams  There was a super market across the street and an outlet shopping centre within a   minute drive Our stay here was very enjoyable  I was so glad we didn t stay in one of the smoke smelling casino s  
N =>   Not the best not the worst  I will not be back to this property  The Cancun Resort Las Vegas is satisfactory if you are looking for a hotel off the beaten path in LV The two bedroom suite we had was ok  but housekeeping was lacking  The same crushed sunflower seed  not from me  stayed on the carpet the entire week s stay  When we checked out  I looked under the bed in the case I had dropped something and boy  I wish I hadn t looked  It was clear they do not vacuum under there and none of the detritus garbage had been from me  The living room carpet was wet the entire stay and nothing was done  Our coffee was NEVER replenished  One day our bath mat was gone and on four separate days we did not receive service at all I will say that the jet bathtubs were fantastic after a day walking The internet in the  Business Centre quot  is credit card only and took     minutes to load the first site The shuttle drivers were AWESOME  they should have been hired as concierge  The concierge I spoke to twice had no information at all to help me on two rather basic questions To top it off  the airport had been closed the first night and they charged us for it   even though there was no way we could have arrived   
N =>   Loved It Loved the Condo  tried to get info on purchasing one but got no help  Will stay there again everytime we go back to Vegas  
N =>   If you are under       A place to avoid  We went there on a timeshare promotion  With that said  you would have expected it to be GRAND  It was anything but  The checkin was like checking in to a Motel   or Super   rather than a Las Vegas hotel  I have stayed at many of the Strip hotels in the past  and decided to give something of this nature a try  but I was sorely disappointed in almost all aspects of the hotel and staff The room was a   bedroom  Ok in that regard  but nothing spectacular  The elevator did not work on the second day  so we were hoofing it up and down the stairs located at the far ends of the building  We called down to ask for an extra blanket  but were told that they were out  They brought us an extra set of sheets instead  This is not a typical hotel  so do not expect daily maid service to refresh the towels and make the beds  If you stay more than   days  then they will do this  Otherwise you have to pick up fresh towels etc  if you need them The pool was nice to look at  but it was cold and windy this ober  so we did not get a chance to use that  The biggest disappointment was the staff  They seemed to be bothered if you had a question to ask them  When we checked in  we asked the concierge a few questions  and he just seemed put off that we would interrupt him If you are going here for a timeshare promotion  I would highly suggest skipping this offer  Our package included the following items  I am also including their real descriptions as well  We arrived at      PM on Friday night  and the tour desk was closed  Therefore we could not get any of our promotional coupons until Saturday   nd day of our   day stay   We went to the touor desk Saturday at      AM to register for our promotional tour  but they told us the earliest they have available is      PM  Right in the middle of the day  Remember  you cannot get your gift coupons etc  until you complete your tour presentation    Complimentary Sahara Buffet Coupons  Really  the Sahara buffet is       regular price  The coupons are not good for weekend breakfast  lunch or brunch  They are good only Monday thru Friday for all meals  and then Saturday and Sunday for dinner only  But it is a       buffet  and that should speak for itself  Not getting these until after the tour on Saturday made these almost worthless     off golf  They offered only one course and the price would have been     to     per person with the discount  Now remember  you have to go on a   hour promotional tour that you cannot book until      AM on Saturday morning  This tour will most likely be in the afternoon  cutting into your golf time   Mac Kink Comedy show tickets  You must buy a     dollar drink  Show is at  PM and  PM Tuesday thru Saturday  Show is located at the Harrahs Casino Shark Reef Exhibit  This is the only decent thing in the package  Tickets are around     each  I have been before  and it was OK at best  At     each it would be a better value Nathan Burton Magic Show  Lance Burton is the magician you want to see in vegas  This was at hooters casino  No show on Saturday nights  What good vegas show does not run on Saturday night  Thus you could imagine that this is a worthless show as well  Since you cannot get your tickets until after your presentation tour  you would have to stay late Sunday night to see it  UGH          promotional slot play  This is a coupon for promo slot play at the Casino Royale casino  up by Treasure Island   This was a complete waste of time  You go there  and they have about    machines that accept these coupons  You cannot cash out at any time  even if you are winning more credits on the machine  Basically  if you can muster up       credts then you can call an attendant and get      cash  NOT GOING to happen I am telling you  Do not waste your time  I am posative that Casino Royale pays Pacific Monarch to put this in their package as a way to drive to some business up to their area Hawaii or Los Cabos add on vacation  Again a waste of time  like most of these  they are restricted to weekday arrival and departure When we did not buy the timeshare package  the finance guy as well as the sales guy both got visibly upset and almost angry  What did they expect  From the beginning  we had explained to our sales guy that we were very unhappy with the staff attitudes as well as the promotional gifts that were sold as usable  but in reality were not I could not have been more disappointed with the accomodations and the staff at this resort  If you have an option  I would not stay at this place  I have never written a review on this site before  but I feel compelled to help others avoid this trap  
N => 	   My husband loved this place while I was so so on it  The best part of this resort is the pool  Only down side to the pool is that it closes at    p m  Seems too early for Vegas nightlife  If you want to be away from the people  noise and traffic of the strip this is a good location  Close to I     Our room was not very comfortable  While it had everything we needed  it just was not comfortable  Lights in the bathrooms were dim and made it hard to see in the mirror  Had some maintance issues  but chose not to deal with them   after all  we were on vacation  Didn t want to deal with people coming in to fix something  so we did without  That was our choice  On the plus side our room had a great view of the strip  Balcony was huge  just wish there would have been a couple lounge chairs so we could really enjoy  As it was  there were two chairs with a small table  Again  it comes back to that comfort thing  If using our timeshare again  I would try another resort if available over this one  Nothing terribly wrong  just would have liked it better with a few small changes  
N =>   Beautiful Room  We loved our stay at the Cancun Resort  It is a beautiful place with a beautiful pool south of the strip  It was so nice to have a condo rather than a hotel room   having the living room separate from the bedroom gave me the chance to try and catch a few hours sleep in this busy city  The jacuzzi in the bathroom was wonderful after a long day  We were very happy to have a balcony  We went to the grocery store across the street and filled up the fridge with groceries on the first day to save on some dining costs  This is a timeshare facility   and we purchased a tour package for       and it was well worth it  This provided us with five nights stay at this   Star resort as well as many added bonuses gift certificates tickets to shows in Vegas which we took advantage of I would love to go back to The Cancun for another stay but it is a few miles away from the strip and I would like to try staying on the strip next time to avoid paying for a car rental   the hotel does offer a shuttle to the strip  though  if I m not mistaken  
N =>  ok well we got to the hotel  when we got their I asked the receptionist if we may have our room  she said check at  pmso we did and she did not have no room    My friend and I were kinda mad  but around  pm I asked the receptionist again if they had a room already she called her boss and he told me they had a problem with the rooms we wanted to stay at   they did not had no lights so they sent us to south point hotelthats a nice hotel   
N =>   Great place for nervous parents I was pretty nervous to go to vegas as first trip for my   mo old baby   and another   yr old boy and in laws   well  it worked out great  Thanks to tripadvisor reviews and recommendations as always Got a good deal for   bedroom suite facing the strip Plus points     pool   jacuzzu tubs   kids loved the vast tubs   everyday housekpeeing   Great cost         for sat         for weekday nights   closeness to strip   kitchen refrigerator microwave  with utensils etc    Free show tickets to Manadalay Bay Sark Reef and Nathan burton show for   people   for attending the    min timeshare presnetation Could have done better       room suite description says king bed  queen bed  sofa queen bed  well what we found was   queen bed    twin beds and   queen sofa bed    so not having king bed was very uncomfortanble with baby    To our surprise  we dound no light in our bldg no      as transistor for bldg   had blown out  so imagine coming back to hotel with kids around    pm and finding no light on  st day after driving all day     To our respite  light cam be back in our bldg around midnight  but no light for building      I would imagine resort to be welle equipped to handle such scenario   but no consolation compensation from mgmt for all that inconvenience    That s about all   to sum it up  I would still recommend this place to others but just to verify beds in advance Thanks Shruti 
N =>  agree with mother of riverside we arrived on friday night   after a long trip with the kids the whole trip there was mostly talked about the water slides my two boys were very exicited since we got there late on friday at      there was not much to do we unpacked      so saturday morning we went for breakfast took the kids to circus circus came back to the resort around      pm we got all ready for the pool  slides again we were very excited we notice the loogoon pool was closed i asked the young lady that was working in the towel dept   why was it closed she replied beaucuse everyone is in the back as we proceed to go to the back pool omg it did look like a cheap place in t j there was no place to sit   i was like what the heck then we realized the slides were closed down        wondering why   my kids were upset drove   hours for nothing we could of stayed home in our own pool       so i was still curiuos and i asked a lady there did she knew why was it closed she said beaucuse someone pooped in the pool i guessed it had happend on thursday too  that is grossed    someone ruined it for everyone else   my suggestion to the manegment is that when checking in they should give out free water diaper to toddlers  babies that s how they do it in our other time share in the recreation dept activity room you get free water diapers i personally think this would of been a great idea iknow there were very upset people there that weekend including my family spend alot of money for a sorry weekend all for something that could of been preventable 
N =>   Wished we could stay longer  We only stayed one night as we were in town for a wedding  but from the time we checked in which was about   hours early  they were great  co was great on the phone and equally helpful in person  He even called to let us know the room was ready and told us about the pool pass  Our room was a   bedroom and was very clean and well taken care  The whole resort appeared as if it was well maintained  Everyone we had contact with seemed friendly and helpful  We had breakfast in the Cafe by the pool and it was great  lots of food and tasty  The pool is awesome  The only problem I could see was if your in Vegas for the action this might be a little far  especially in traffic  since we were not it did not matter  I would love to come back with friends just to relax around the pool   Thanks co and Nicholas  
N =>   A rather so so experience Overall the property was decent  but there were a few things that I was unimpressed with First  our room had no air conditioning  Turning the A C on would result in the heat coming on  and since this was Spring Break  management had no other rooms to offer us  We resorted to just opening the windows  which made things bearable The other was the shuttle to the Strip  It ran from Noon Midnight  stopping at the resort and at the Tropicana every    minutes  There was only one shuttle running with about    seats on it  Keep in mind again that this was Spring Break and many times there were people left behind by the shuttle because it didn t run often enough to accomodate everyone  Cab fare to and from the various casinos on the Strip ranged from       dollars  so that was an expensive option Having the shuttle stop at the Tropicana was also a bit inconvenient  as the Tropicana is located at the far south end of the Strip Overall  it was a decent place to stay  but I will be staying somewhere on the Strip or with better shuttle service on my next trip to Las Vegas  
N =>  Great place to stay  This is a great place to stay in Las Vegas  It has everything you need and would want in your room  Far enough from the strip to get a break  but only takes     min to be right back in the middle of the strip  Great pool for young and old  
N =>   Great place  We have stayed at this resort approximately five times now  It is one of our favorite resorts to visit for a getaway in Las Vegas  Every time we have been there  our room villa was impeccably clean  the guest service was prompt with extra towels or whatever we requested  The pool  of course  is a great feature  But I really enjoy the on site spa for relaxing  They have massage therapists that are really exceptional I will recommend this place to all who ask  
N =>   Learn some customer service please On our second night there I woke up at     am to go to the bathroom  When I turned on the lights there were cockroaches everywhere in my bathroom and my bedroom  They were even crawling on my suitcase  I ran through the villa waking up everyone and turning on lights  The front desk told me to come down and get started on paperwork for a new room  No apology  no nothing  We got a new room  which was smelly  dirty  and faced the parking lot  My cockroach room at least had a nice poolside courtyard view  Refused the room and was told there was nothing else he could do for me until the manager arrived at  am  Mind you it was about  am now and that meant sitting around for   hours  There were   of us girls who went away for a  quot girl s weekend quot  and now in our pajamas with hardly any sleep we were stuck to wait in the lobby until  am  I suppose we could have gone back to our cockroach room  or the dirty new room but considering the money we spent I felt we deserved better  We got kicked out of the lobby by security at     am because the hotel didn t want people checking out or checking in to see us  We went to breakfast and Walmart to kill time and buy one of the girls some new clothes  I realize this was her choice  but she had a full blown anxiety   panic attack when she saw the roaches on her things  She left     of her belongings in the cockroach room because she could not even handle bringing them home with her  She spent      at Walmart to get through the last   days of our trip  When we got back we were given a long overdue apology    free meal for all   of us at the cafe on the grounds  which served sandwiches and frys   no compensation to my friend who bought new clothes  and the best of all    another   hour wait out by the hotel pool in our pajamas while we waited for people to check out so we could get ANOTHER new room  I will never go back here  nor will any of my friends  For the price that we paid and the fact that our building was a time share I thought we would not have had any problems  I am extremely disappointed with how our situation was handled  The disrespect we were shown from the front desk  the nonchalant attitude the manager took with us  and the lack of compensation for our inconvenience and experience screams of poor management  Next time I will handle my own arrangements because when I phoned Expedia for assistance I spent most of    minutes on hold only to be told that they could not do anything until the manager arrived either  Of course they could have found us a new hotel  but we would have had to pay for it  In my experience a well run business should always have someone on duty who can make decisions to alleviate a problem  no matter what time of day it is  I guess we can all chalk it up to  quot live and learn quot   I will be following other travelers  advice more closely and sticking with  quot big name quot  hotels in Vegas  I took pictures of the roaches as proof  and would be happy to email photos  
N =>  This does not deserve any Stars It is impossible to comprehend how Interval International  with whom we arranged our exchange  could give this Resort a   Star rating The entire resort is untidy  bordering on dirty and unkempt  The air conditioning and water systems are decrepit and noisey  The service level provided by the employees is casual to say the least  Our unit was advertised for six people but the sleeping accommodation was not large enough for sleeping six adults due to the limited available space and absence of sufficient storage space for clothing  The kitchen area was far too small and not sufficiently equipped for six people  When the inventory was checked numerous items were missing and not replaced when requested  There were strange artificial plants dotted about which were dusty  had pieces falling off and took up too much space  The furniture was old and I have seen better in a charity shop  The blinds did not close properly and let in light from the balcony light which came on automatically every evening and could not be turned off  The linen and towels had definitely seen better days After our first night there we had to change rooms because we could not sleep due to the noisy air conditioning and water rushing through the pipes  We were told by a completely disinterested member of staff at  am there was nothing they could do about it and speak to the manager in the morning  They obviously thought that if they were awake why shouldn t we be  The second room was no better because   people could not sleep in the lounge area due to the noise again from the a c and the fridge freezer Both of our rooms were in the Merida building which we were told was a new block  god knows what the inside of an old block is like During the weekend we were there the resort was very crowded due to the fact the hotel seems to issue day passes to people to use the pool  Rules for behaviour around the pool and in the public areas are disregarded by these visitors and not enforced by the local management  The pool access gates were never locked and so the pool was open to all comers as well as paying guests The underground parking is fine but there are only limited number of spaces under each block and when they are gone   the car fries  The lock on the security door from the underground parking in the Merida building was broken so any non resident could access the inside of block without having to use a pass key We checked in on   e for a week but left after   nights and went to the riott Chateau  It cost us big bucks but we did not fly nearly    hours across the Pond to stay in this kind of hotel it would have completely ruined our week  
N =>   Enjoyed   Hope to Return  We went to the Cancun Resort and I must say we enjoyed it very much  After reading a few reviews I was a little skeptical about how the trip was going to turn out  When we got there we walked the property to see what was going on and we were pleased   c the grounds were and clean  The concierge was very friendly and knowledgable of what to do for the nightlife  The Caribu Lounge had pretty good drinks  The rooms were private and it felt like home away from home  What we enjoyed the most was the jacuzzi with the complimentary hammock under the trees  Even though the weather was scorchin  it was still enjoyable  The Strip was only about    minutes away by car  There is free parking which is great depending on what end of the strip you want to be on  To sum it all up We enjoyed our visit and plan on going back  
N =>  Details DO Make A Difference Upon arrival  my husband and I observed the artificial plants   flowers in the planters outside the lobby area  First impression  Low budget property  Our one bedroom  quot cave quot  was dark and unappealing  The one bedroom is suitable for two  no more  One of the two sinks in the master bath did not drain  although maintenance attempted to clear the drain  The rack over the toilet in the second bath was not secure  therefore not safe to place toiletries  The bathtowels seemed clean  but stained and worn  We do not recommend margaritas at the Caribe Lounge  A Courtesy Shuttle is available to the strip and Fremont Street  Fremont Street is a must see if you have not experienced it before  The laser light show is at     pm and the street entertainment was good  The Courtesy Shuttle schedule does not pick you up until midnight  We found the   hours was too long for our taste  yet if we were gamblers the   hours might had gone by quickly  We were shown a   bedroom and the Penthouse accomodations  Both were airy and nice  although our decision was not to purchase this time share  
N =>   very clean  Went with family  amp  stayed at this resort When we arrived I was quite pleased to see a nice well lite reception  which was pleasing to the eye  Our appartment was very large  amp  well equipped with cooker  microwave  kettle fridge  tv  etc  amp  we had a separate dining area  amp  the views of the strip   night were amazing  our bedroom was very clean  amp  comfortable  amp  the maids came daily  amp  always replaced comp toiletries  We also had a huge jacuzzi bath On our  st day we ordered breakfast   the works   from the resorts diner  The food arrived piping hot  amp  lots of it  the fruit smoothies are a must  amp  I ordered a chilli burger   dinner time to find it was a burger in a bap covered in chilli concarne  different from what we get back in England but was very tasty The swimming pools  amp  outdoor hot tub was fab  Opposite the reception they have a travel desk  their trips are quite reasonable  amp  the   ladies were very helpful Calls back to the U K are very expensive so buy a phone card from cancuns machines  amp  use their phone booths  amp  you can call home for a fraction of the price The resort is quite far away  from the strip  you cant walk it But dont let that put u off  because the resort do offer a comp shuttle which takes you to the strip  amp  u can jump on  amp  off at different pick up points  Dont take a taxi as they rip you off They have a fashion outlet on the other side of the road   resort shuttle stops there   amp  you can get some great designer bargains We had a great time here  amp  we also felt very safe  amp  would not hesitate in coming back to this resort in the future  
N =>  Customer service problems and construction Just returned from a week at the Cancun  The rooms were nice enough  but to the north of the resort is construction that starts at  am The customer service received when staying there was way below expectations  Only after contacting the corporate ownership  my concerns were dealt with  I bought the weeks stay through a timeshare and given a terrible room  If you check in on a Sunday for a weeks stay all the good rooms  non construction  may be gone  so be advised The pool was nice  the food on site was okay  We were woke up one morning by housekeeping trying to get in to clean our room a day early telling us we were supposed to be gone  then told we had to call the front desk to tell them we weren t leaving Our room wasn t cleaned the day it was supposed to be cleaned  when I called the front desk  they told me I had to call housekeeping  they couldn t  My husband sat in a broken chair by the pool  when we told a staff member  he said there was nothing he could do about the broken chair There are even more instances  but you get the point Overall it is a nice enough resort  they just need to work on customer service training with their staff  
N =>   Awsome This was great  We invited our friends to stay and only booked   bedroom  we had plenty of room and privacy  Would recomend for familys and couples that want to get away from it all  You do need your own car due to the distance from the strip but worth it Price was moderate and room service was worth it in the morrning  The pool was awsome we spenf the entire day just pool side drinkin  flyn  myans  Word of caution   will do ya   
N =>  Fabulous Las Vegas Fabulous Cancun Fabulous resort  We stayed a week at Cancun Resort and we all hated to leave  The   bedroom unit was very large with nice comfortable beds and great bathrooms  Loved the underground parking in Cancun Building  The car was always cool when you got in to leave the property  Front Desk was excellent  Fast check in  Nicholas was the best  He always told us a good route to take to where we were going  Pool was wonderful  Clean  Use your room key to check out floats or towels  Huge pool with hammocks and waterslides  Nice restaurant near pool with good drinks  Beautiful landscape  Grocery store right across the street  Nice library across street  We walked across the street to check our email free at library  Brand new casino called the Southcoast right down the street  Southcoast was fabulous casino with great mexican restaurant and bingo Two trolley stops from the Cancun  Trolley       all day to all the strip or       one ride to Southcoast  Also  there is a free shuttle we didn t ride because we had rental car  Only negative to resort was having to make a U turn to leave and the couch in the living room wasn t too comfortable  but fit the decorating theme   Mid week maid service free with clean towels etc  We absolutely loved the resort  Non Smoking resort and a nice break each night from the crowed strip  Hope to return soon to Cancun Resort  
N =>  attention to detail  we stayed at the resort in nov  with my wife  son  amp  daughter  and   of my son s teammates  pop warner tournament  we had a wonderful time  the boys used the huge pool  amp  jacuzzi  we cooked our Thanksgiving dinner just like at home  we had everything we needed  and what we didn t have  the room service came to our rescue immediately  I have been reading some of the other comments  and i totally disagree  We had never stayed in a timeshare before  and will never stay in a hotel again when going to vegas  
N =>  VERY IMPRESSED I must say prior to our stay I was a bit concerned because I had read some of the reviews on this site  After staying there for a couple of days  I find the information opinions posted to be false  My husband and I stayed in a one bedroom  A couple of days prior to our trip I called and requested a room with wireless internet access and a pool view  Both requests were met and it was very nice  I had read a previous review about the room not being very clean  so when I entered our room I did a complete inspection  I found everything to be clean and ordearly  I was very impressed  The view from our balcony at night was amazing  I enjoyed the fact that it was away from the chaos on the strip  There was a trolley that comes to the resort every    mins  it takes you to different locations on the strip and an all day pass was only        All in all our stay was great  the staff was excellent and very friendly  It goes to show you can t believe everything you read until you experience it yourself  
N => No where near a   star resort    Resort was a disappointment  it definitely doesn t rate as a   star resort  At the most it probably gets a        Reception was unwilling to swap my room with a room with a view of the pool as oppossed to the roadway even though the resort didn t appear anywhere near capacity  The parking was atrocious  if you parked in the parking garage you would have to walk with your luggage through the lobby and out into the courtyard to access your room  Maid service was subpar   we had to  quot steal quot  towels from the maids cart because they only  quot cleaned quot  the room on Wednesdays  The jetted tub spit out scum when tried to use it  on two occassions  The management expected us to inventory the utensils in the room  The second room was so small there was practically no room for the luggage and the bed comforters were probably the cheapest synthetics I ve ever seen in any type of room at any level  The supposed concierge had very litle knowledge of her job  she practically threw the free show coupons at us and didn t even attempt to explain any activities in detail without prompting from me   she was apparently too busy talking to her buddy on the phone  Overall this resort was not even close to a fair exchange even though it is advertised as   star  The management and staff has a lot to learn  The pool area was nice and the availability of the hot tubs were very accomadating  
N =>  Casino or Not I stayed in a  Br unit Labor day week  It was hot and the pool was very enjoyable  Especially the free use of floats  We rented a car  which I would highly suggest  Parking on the strip was relatively easy   All casinos have parking and we took advantage of valet parking also  The resort is clean as were the units  I think personally I would prefer to be more on the strip where the action is  such as casinos  I found that I couldn t enjoy gambling as much knowing we had to walk to our car  amp  drive back   I would have liked to sat around gambling  had a few drinks  amp  took an elevator up to my room   It s just a preference  I ve only been to Vegas a few times  amp  enjoy walking on the strip  I know many that like to sleep all day  amp  gamble all night  amp  this resort is much more for them  Driving in Vegas is easier than I thought  Our   BR unit faced the pool  not that we used the balcony much  mostly during morning coffee  Would I stay again  Never say never  if the price is right  It is nice to have a full kitchen    baths  plus I did a timeshare exchange  All in all  it was worth the price  
N =>  Loved the Penthouse  We stayed   nights in the Penthouse   BR   BA w kitchen  dining rm  LR w Big screen TV and wetbar  amp  an outside balcony that had a spa jacuzzi   The location of this place is on the strip  but way out there  a couple of miles from Mandalay Bay   You ll need a car  I don t rely on shuttles or cabs  I saw a bunch of people waiting as we arrived  but hey shuttles cabbies have bad days too  The resort is still being built  but I ve stayed in two different buildings and their upkeep has been good  Past the front desk as you go towards the pool  it seems busy  Tons of people walking around   well it s a timeshare resort and they re selling  So it s best to check in and go back out the front door to move your car to where your room will be  They ll give you a map Check in out was a breeze  Staff was very friendly  We arrived a few hours early and they had no problem letting us check in  Then  our party was running a little late and they had no problem extending an hour of our checkout  The Penthouse was on the  rd floor  my MIL needed a handicapped room   there are other floors with Penthouses  All Penthouses face the pool  The MBR had a HUGE whirlpool tub in it  The  nd room was for the in laws and it had a walk roll in shower and a seperate jacuzzi tub  Between the rooms was the living rooms  with a sofa and a wet bar  The layout was very well done  Beds weren t as comfortable as at home  but come on  we were here to gamble in Vegas  Maintenance was called due to lights that were out and they came within minutes  We requested a shower seat at the front desk and as we arrived in the room  housekeeping was fulfilling our request I don t think I would get the Penthouse in ober again  I would rather just get a  BR  same layout as PH  but no outdoor balcony and smaller LR   The weather was real windy and cool  so we didn t use the outside spa jacuzzi Parking was good  They say it s   car per room  but we indicated that our other party was in another car  they didn t seem to mind  The pool was clean and I always saw kids and life guards around  I didn t use their poolside restaurant  but they do have one and a little general store  They also have a gameroom past the front desk before you get to their timeshare selling counter I would stay here again  It s clean  they re friendly and polite  The location is out there  but we really didn t mind because we like to casino hop and we drove ourselves  The place was decorated in an theme and it wasn t over done  This place could be loved by singles  couples and families  
N =>  Nice Place Stayed here for   nights and was completely satisfied  When we checked in  the staff was friendly and helpfull  It was explained that we would not get a pool view room due to being a   bedroom unit  We were OK with this because it was our aniversery and we did not plan on staring out the window anyway  We had a nice room located in the main building facing Las Vegas Blvd  this was better then facing the pool anyway  it was relaxing  Large rooms for Vegas  The pool was inviting and plenty of lifegaurds  Resturant had some amazing food for the size of the kitchen  There was some cosmetic issues  but was explained that they are doing upgrades currently  We had brand new mattress   very nice   
N =>  Happy with the Cancun resort We stayed here as part of our honeymoon in e       We were more than happy wth our room  cleanliness and everyhing else  The pool was lovely  always sunbeds available and attentive staff  We had our own car but still used the shuttle service as we could then both have a drink in the evenings  We had no problem with the shuttle but the only advice I would give is that they don t wait so get there within good time  A good location just off the strip   a quick drive or short taxi ride if the shuttle dosn t suit  Would be more than happy to stay there again  
N =>  Better than I thought     I stayed at the Cancun Resort in ust and had a great time  I was there with my mother and my    year old niece  The pool was great  there was a little foam in it due to the construction  but not enough to cause problems  The staff there was always willing to help out  I enjoyed the craft classes  there should be one daily for adults  The shuttle service was really good and the drivers were great  very talkative  it was never late no matter what time of day we used it  They should make daily stops to the supermarket across the street and also start earlier in the day than noon  I highly recommend the Cancun to anyone who likes to relax and enjoy time off the strip   
N => Not what expected but OK We stayed at the Cancun resort for   nights  when we first arrived  we did not like the set up very much   the location is great   but the rooms do need more updating  The beds were horrible   my husb and I woke up with back pain each night  we felt like we were sleeping on box springs   and we had changed our original room and both beds were the same  the pool was nice and big  but due to the construction of the new building  the pool would get dirty and full of foam   i ended up taking the pool stick to clean out the dirt because they took too long  but it then felt like a waste of time because there was so much of it  the kitchen is small  but functional   and the place does grow on you  We had a   bedroom    bath with   children   i agree that they should have   beds in the other bedroom rather than   bed   bathrooms were updated and bathtubs jacuzzi s were large and the place in comparison to other   bedroom timeshare s we ve stayed in was on the small side  I wont say that i would not stay there again   but i would not rush to stay there either  
N =>  Very disappointed We were very disappointed with the Cancun resort  I think we would give it   stars  The beds were thin and you could feel the springs every time you turn over  The kitchen was so tiny that you had no room to move around The decor and furniture was very shabby  the wood was actually peeling off  We had a one bedroom  with two bathrooms  The master bathroom was huge   bigger than the kitchen  but behind the door there was a big patch where someone must have made a hole in the wall with the doorknob and then they came in a plastered over it and never painted it We had a balcony with a view of the pool and the construction across the way  The pool itself was very nice  but that was all we thought was nice The staff was also nice  but the place itself we would never stay in again Also we go to Las Vegas a lot and always stay on the strip in the Monte Carlo or one of the other hotels and find it to be more fun  You don t have to move your car all the time and we enjoy being right there  We visit family while there so we go a lot  We have a time share in Florida that beats the Cancun any day and so we were disappointed with our stay Very very shabby  I also forgot to mention that both bathrooms clogged up a couple of times during our stay and we had to have maintenance come in  Also the bathroom lights went out  both bathrooms  had to have someone come up to fix the fuse  We would not recommend this place at all  Looks nice from the outside  but beware  
N =>  Cancun  Best Timeshare in Vegas If you re looking for the noisy night life of Las Vegas  then please book a room on the  quot strip quot   the Cancun is not for you  But if you re looking for a relaxing getaway with a beautiful room  amp  pool  then by all means you ll love the Cancun The Cancun is a sister property of our timeshare resort in Palm Springs  CA  amp  we spent   days here in        We are a single couple  but my husband s mother also stayed with us at the property Check in  Smooth  amp  easy   the staff was wonderful even giving us options of what one bedroom units were available Rooms  one bedroom   Beautiful  amp  clean  Although the kitchenette is small  it was well stocked  The one bedroom was of adequate size with a king size bed  closet  tv  amp  drawer space  The bed was fairly comfortable although we heard from our timeshare newsletter that they are replacing all the mattress with pillow top mattresses  The bathroom was HUGE   double sinks    person jacuzzi tub  plenty of drawer space  cabinets  towel bars  etc  The living room was used by my mother in law  The sofa pulled out to a bed  which she stated was comfortable   amp  we were pleasantly surprised to find a door between the kitchen dining room area and the living room area that had a small bathroom with a shower  toilet  pedastal sink  amp  medicine cabinet  The living room also had a closet in it as well as a wooden screen that can be pulled to separate the bathroom living room area from the kitchen dining room area to have privacy  Also  off the living room was a decent sized patio  Although we had a pool view room  the noise level was at a bare minimum  The only thing that would have made this room any better would be a balcony off the bedroom Pool  The water was clean  the slides were fun for people of all ages  amp  the bar food area is close to the pool  There was plenty of seating for everyone  but if you want some shade  get there before   am Transportation  We didn t use the transportation system because we had our own car  so I can t rate that  I can say that you are a few miles from the main strip  but I found it nice to have a  quot retreat quot  to go to at the end of the day We loved our stay at the Cancun  amp  will always stay there when we travel to Las Vegas  
N =>  No Where Close to   Star Worst of our Interval International Stays  The staff were not helpful  seemed put out when we had questions and seemed totally dis interested in our satisfaction  Concierge was busy finishing her day and threw some brochures at us about shows and ended the conversation abruptly The  quot shuttle bus quot  was  quot in the shop quot   The back up van was jammed full  with approximately       of us remaining to fend for ourselves  No apologies  no  quot thinking out of the box quot   just an  quot Oh well quot  shrug and an offer to call a     cab for us  no help with this expense  On the night we left  we asked for a cab  We waited over an hour and  instead of calling another company  the guy at the desk used comments like  quot they re very busy and will get to you when they can quot  FINALLY  he called another company and we were on our way  making our flight with   minutes to spare I WOULD NOT recommend this  quot resort quot  
N =>  definitely not a   star We booked with Hotels  nightmare  we insisted we wanted a Jacuzzi room  and specifically asked that the jucuzzi be in the main room to overlook the strip   in vegas   We asked if there was a casino at this hotel  and a restuarant  Truth is     the restaurant is just a grille  what we thought was a restaurant was a large area where people were being worked over to purchase timeshares  and the Jacuzzi room turned out to be a jetted tub in the bathroom  the carpet was so filthy that within    min  my wife and her girlfriend s bare feet were black  there was no casino  We were offered to stay the next night free  we left and paid for the new york new york  which we will only stay at from now on    see the review  told them to give the free room to the homeless  we never saw the shuttle bus  and paid for limo as they said the shuttle not have room for our luggage anyway  P gt S gt  Hotels inferred that this room was comparable to a      room    in fact I would not have paid more than     had I wanted to stay there  
N =>  Not a Five Star Resort This resort is listed in Interval International as a five star facility  The resort has the appropriate amenities  it is beautiful  but the management  operation  and its customer service is very lacking  During our stay  y          the following issues occurred    Main Pool was shut down y         due to a major mechanical problem  A water leak in the pump room shorted out electrical devices  A good maintenance   security program could have prevented the catastrophic effect of a leak  Management provided NO arrangements for the guests to swim at other LV hotels     The AC unit for an entire building shut off around midnight on     We called the front desk    am and were told maint comes in at   am  We left our room at    am and the temperature was    degrees  The maintenance dept should have been called IN     am  Also no call was made by mgmt to inform us what was wrong   they waited until individual units called them first  Like the pool   the management and maintenance dept do not have adequate systems in place to run a decent resort     Room cleaning   many timeshare resorts mention that everydayservice is not provided but this is the FIRST of my TEN experiences that it did not happen     Actually we scheduled our midweek to occur when we had new guests arriving  Only the bed linens and sheets were changed  NO CLEANING  We had to call the front desk after we got back to our room and wait about an hour while a second cleaning was done     The attitudes   behavior of the pool staff was lousy  The lifeguards were confrontational and arrogant  We witnessed an overweight woman in swim trunks sleeveless tshirt confronted by   different people because it was not considered appropriate swimwear  The woman was uncomfortable wearing a real swimsuit due to her physical situation  Even mgmt got involved  We were confronted for jumping into the pool  sitting on the steps leading into the slide area  and wearing jewelry  We are    years old were not a Safety risk In summary  be prepared for anything  
N => Smell First time visit at Cancun Resort  e           and last time  We checked in to the penthouse at      p m  after a    minute search for a cart to take our luggage upstairs to the  th floor  Upon entering the penthouse we were met with the nastiest smell ever  To make a long story short a cap to sewer pipe had broken and we had to put up with the smell from Sunday e      p m  to Monday morning e       a m  Imagine spending all night with the smell of sewage  I complaint to the front desk at   p m on the   th and they finally sent a SECURITY person at midnight  How s that for running a hotel  Finally it was repaired the next day  We had to sleep with the sliding doors open all night  No air conditioning Next one section of the sliding door in the master bedroom fell off the track  They could not repair until we checked out  Talk about having privacy in the  quot John  quot  The other section of the door had no handle  Last but not least we found a huge cockroach in the bathtub in the smaller bedroom I complained to the head administrator at the resort and she said  quot we have no control over the smell  quot  Give me a break  But yes they did charge me points  I wrote a letter to Monarch Grand Vacations about this experience and I haven t heard from them yet  But they sure want their montly payments each month on time  The Cancun Resort is a long way from being a   star resort  
N =>  Had a great time   Could improve the shuttle My husband and I stayed at the Cancun Resort from e   to     We had a great time in Vegas and really enjoyed our stay at the resort  It was really great that the resort provided a shuttle into the main part of the strip  but more than once we had to wait for long periods of time for it to show up and once it skipped the pick up completely from the Tropicana  leaving us there for a hour and a half in the hot sun  I can t compare this resort to others in Vegas as that was our first time there  However  our room was great  the pool was amazing  and we found the staff very friendly  We would stay at this resort again  It would be nice though if you didn t have to cross a   lane highway to get a few groceries  
N =>  TERRIBLE GUEST SERVICE  i stayed at the cancun resort in las vegas on june  th for three nights and i was very unpleased with guest service  they were extremely rude and not helpful whatsoever  they didn t know too much about the resort  i fell from the stairs as i was walking towards the pool area because the whole side of our building had NO lights for three hours and no one noticed it until i complained to front desk  then it took them another hour to fix it  we had crickets jumping into our forth floor penthouse every night and when i asked for someone to come up and take care of it  no one came  the water pressure in the shower was awful  they didn t even provide any toothpaste  i had a terrible experience with the rudest receptionist ever  as i was checking out and she didn t even bother to apologize for her mistake  she tried to say i was lying when i had a witness there the whole time  i am still very upset  this was my first time ever to use my timeshare  and never again will i go back and deal with bad service like that again  
N =>  Peace and Quiet   Far cry different from life on the Strip   I was very wary about going to a hotel that I pretty much knew nothing about  We usually stay on the Strip to be close to everything  but we decided to make this a different type of Vegas trip  We arrived at approximately      on a monday night  We were greeted with smiles and our checkin was quick and easy  The outside of the hotel was beautiful  as was the lobby  Our room was pretty nice  We had a one bedroom villa facing the mountains  Fully stocked kitchen  sliding wood shutters and a balcony greeted us  The master bathroom was pretty large and the whirlpool bath was large enough for myself and my husband  The small second bathroom was a nice addition  We didn t have to run to the bathroom in the bedroom     The pool was huge  Both sides were open and several families were taking advantage of the pool floats and  quot noodles quot   My   year old son loved the floats  The waterslides looked fun  however my son was to small to ride  One lifeguard I spoke to said they even offered  quot catchers quot   They would wait at the bottom of the slide for your child to come down  I thought that was really cool  The jacuzzi s  approx   of them  were really nice and the hammocks rocked  We found the staff to be extremely friendly and quick to accomodate  The burgers were delicious  Especially the chili burgers  didn t have to carry cash around the resort  we just charged everything to the room and paid at checkout  There was no construction noise and housekeeping knocked politely at    am to see if we needed anything  There was no Strip noise  only a    minute drive to MGM  and ladies  the best thing of all was the Las Vegas Fashion Outlet store was a block away  Shopping  I would definately return here for a quiet Vegas retreat  They even offer activities for children  Arts and Crafts and other classes  Very nice   
N =>  Overall good but there are major problems  
N => 	 Not enough words to describe this wonderful resort  
N => Absolutely loved this resort  
N =>  Not what we expected We had never stayed at the Candlewood chain before  so we didn t know what to expect  At check in  we were greeted promptly and provided all the info about the property  We went to our room and immediately walked out  The room has a weird  quot Motel   quot  odor and we knew we couldn t sleep here for the night  The room was prepaid and the cost was very little  So  no harm done as we went to the strip and stayed at one of the better trip hotels  
N =>  It was just OK We stayed   days there and the experience was just ok  The location was good  very close to the strips  The room did have some sort of smell though    Since they dont provide daily housekeeping  you prob have to shop in Walmart first so you dont spend much on getting things later  Be aware  they even charge     for coffee  which you are supposed to get for free if the hotel provides daily housekeeping serv  The booking sys was a mess    we made two seperate reservations  When we checked in  we were told everything was taken care of and there was no need to recheck in  However  two strangers tried to open our room one day and the hotel then found of the second reservation was shown as  quot no show quot  in their system  Overall  it is a good family hotel since you do have a big fridge and kitchen  But    how would cook every single day while in Vegas     
N =>   Run from Candlewood Staff was friendly but that is the only thing this hotel had  No maid service and a non refundable pet deposit  Isn t a deposit suposed to be returned when they verify everything in the room is ok  They should call it a pet fee and then we would not have booked this hotel  La Quinta right next door does not charge a pet fee and they even have grass  Would never stay at this hotel again and I don t understand how they stay in business when their rates are higher than the casino s and the room was in need of updating  
N =>  Not what I expect from Candlewood I booked into this hotel as it was the nearest to the strip with a kitchen  Thats probably the only good part as we had a baby with us  They switch off the AC as soon as you leave your room  so its like   Deg when you return in summer  Even the hotel corridors are hot and humid The rooms are clean but the bed is kindda small   Staff was ok   
N =>  Good accommodation if you are on a budget not too far to The Strip     KM  Stayed for   Nights  a little musty when we checked in  but had been travelling for    hours straight  so we didn t really care  or a little old  but we didn t really care  Air Con seemed jammed on  found out there s a  hidden  panel on the AC unit and were finally able to turn down  Might be    KM from the strip  but given we walked  KM return each way on the North  amp  South side of the strip each day  an extra    KM didn t worry us  Good thing is Flamingo  the main st you walk down to get to the strip  is in the middle  Nth Sth  of the strip  so we were able to do the south half one day  Bellagio to Luxor  and the north half the next  Caesers to Stratosphere   Good little shop in the hotel to buy individual milks  cereals  cans of Coke etc  all about us      ea  Free WiFi too  good for iPhone  
N =>  Adequate but     We used Holiday Inn points to stay here  arriving a day early for a convention at Lowes Lake Las Vegas  I ll review that too   When we arrived  they told us they only had smoking rooms  When DH pitched a fit  I would have been in the ER if we had to sleep in a smoking room  as only DH can do  they came up with a nonsmoking room  which we had specified in the reservation  Therefore  I don t know if this room was typical or not  I think it might have been a little shabbier than most  Initially  the room key would not open the door from outside the hotel and some other guests let us into the building  After we straightened that out  we settled in  The furniture and decor were pretty beat  There was a big wet spot on the carpeting in the kitchen  a few feet from the sink  I didn t want to find out anymore about that  however the room was very clean  I checked out the refrigerator  Strangely  there was a huge conference room type table in the suite  It was actually convenient for our suitcases etc    We walked to the strip  which we didnt realize was so far  past winos lounging on the street with bottles in paper bags etc We cabbed back  We did hear planes from the airport  although that wasn t a problem  The bed was fine and I really liked the sheets  they were very comfortable  By the time DH got to the breakfast place  there was no food so we had coffee and some kind of breakfast bars  which I think he had to pay for  I can see how it wouldn t be bad for a business traveller on a long stay  especially since I think our room was probably sub standard due to the smoking issue  Bottom line  It was superior to a tent  although I do like camping   
N =>   Great place to stay  My friends and I stayed here as an alternative to camping while on a rock climbing trip to Red Rocks  It was great   front desk staff was friendly  rooms were big enough to comfortably keep all of our bags and gear and we had plenty of space to cook our own meals  It was a pretty quick drive into the mountains and a    minute walk to the strip   location was excellent  For being so close to the airport and the strip it was quieter than expected  Only tip   fill up your water bottle in the gym  Vegas water tastes funny  
N =>  Really good   We were getting into town late   am  so decided we would use a reward point night and stay at this place I would not hesitate to reccomend this place  We really liked it  It was a clean  spacious room with lots of useful amenities  I would stay there again if I was looking to stay off strip at a good price  I wouldn t reccomend it if you want to be in the heart of the action Great chilled out option  
N =>   Okay Chose this hotel as it is Holiday in points share hotel  The service was fine  the room was a little worn  not necessarily dirty  but in need of some updating  bathroom was small  The A C wouldn t shut off   Not such a bad thing in      heat  There are some nice extras with this chain however  they have a selection of dvd s at the front desk which you can check out for free  There is a little store also to get a snack  The room did have a full if small kitchen  The location is convenient  IF you have a car to travel to the strip  Personally I would not stay at this hotel again  but more because it doesn t fit my style of travel than any short coming on the hotels part  
N =>   Great deal and convenient Stayed there one night in e before leaving to do the parks in Utah  Room and bath were clean  bed was comfy  kitchen had everything you would need for a longer stay  Pool was out of commission while we were there  but that was not a high priority for us  Everything was a short drive away and we were very pleased For the price we paid      plus tax  this was the best deal we found in Vegas  
N =>  ZERO rating    We stayed at Candlewood Suites at other locations  and liked the hotel very much  but this experience with the Las Vegas location was the worst of all hotel experiences I had We checked in around  pm  The check in was fast  and the clerk was very nice  Went to the room  the room temperature was at    degrees  and the AC was not running  When we approached the AC  it started to run  and we checked the wallunit which sets the room temperature at    degrees  As we settled  and took a rest  the AC would stop  but when we move around  it would kick in again  That prompted us to think that there was a motion sensing device  The problem is it stops running when everything is quiet in the room  NOT when the room temperature reaches the set    degrees  Also  when it stops running  it makes annoying clicking noise  We reported the problem immediately  the front desk  Larry  promised to call the maintenance and get back to us  And that never occured unfortunately We went out  and came back around midnight to a steaming    degree room again  The AC kicked in immediately when we entered the room  When we went to sleep  the AC would stop running after   minutes of quietness and completely disregard the thermostat setting  I complained to the front desk  and the lady clerk appologized  and said the whole hotel is all booked  and there is no room to switched to  We wrestled with the AC for about   hours  and finally  my wife cannot stand it  and went downstairs and confronted the frontdesk lady  The clerk sent an elder security man to our room to check on the AC unit  The gentleman was baffled as we were about the AC unit  Upon my wife and the gentleman s return to the front desk  miraculously two rooms are available to us to move to  The clerk said it was cancellation  and that probably would not pass the dumbest lie detector  Cancellation at  am  and the two vacant rooms being across the hall and next door make it hard to believe it is a coincidence So at  am  we moved to the room across the hall way  This room does not have a thermostat on the wall to set the temprature  and the AC was either on or off  The AC was rather noisy when it was on constantly  but at least we were able to go to sleep When the front desk lady told me there was nothing she could do  I took her words for it  and that was the part that hurt the most  I wanted to say that to her in the morning  but she was off duty when we checked out  She offered us     discount  but I rather had a better stay  
N =>  Dirty dingy and noisy My room seemed dirty from the moment I walked in last night  I slept with my socks on   just in case   and didn t touch anything I didn t have to  But this morning I almost had a heart attack with I unfurled my towel to dry off and there was a giant hair ball  the size of my hand   lying in wait   Without my contacts in  at first I thought it was a huge bug   Totally grossed out  I dressed as quickly as possible and hurried downstairs  where the morning front desk supervisor comp d my room  I don t care about the free room  I would never advise anyone stay there unless you don t care about the cleanliness of your room In addition  a few more complaints about the property   my room was cold and the thermostat had to be set to at least    to turn off the air conditioning  the property is under the flight path to McCarran Airport so all night long  there are tons of airplanes flying overhead  upon checking in  the front desk staff mentioned the complimentary pantry of food  but when I went for a snack it s an honor system pay set up  the clock in my room was set   hours fast with both alarms  quot on quot  and no instructions for fixing it  I was able to turn off the alarms  but never did figure out how to change the clock  and finally     at     pm the front desk staff called to check on how my room was   What if I had already been asleep   
N =>  Great location and price for Vegas We stayed at the Candlewood Suites for   nights in tember  We knew we were going to be off strip but we really happy with the location  Our room was really nice with a kitchenette  And the swimming pool was lovely after a long day sightseeing  They have a little shop where you can buy things and leave money which was really handy as well  We walked to the strip and back both days we were there   the walk there isn t too bad but it feels a bit longer on the way back after a few drinks and walking round the Casinos but it is doable  We ate at Terribles one night which was pretty good and very cheap  The staff were really helpful and I would definitely recommend this place if you re looking somewhere cheap to stay in Vegas  We stayed at the Bellagio for   more nights so it was a good way for us to have longer in Vegas but not pay really high prices the whole time we were there  
N =>  A Good Near Strip Hotel I like Candlewood Suites  They re excellent places  with very nice well outfitted rooms and a fairly priced convenience store on site  This one is close to the Strip  if that matters  but not on it  if that matters  I think that  s a plus  One drawback was no Internet access  at least when I was there  that may have changed by now   I even walked into the parking lot with my laptop to try to find a wireless signal from somewhere  but only got one faint return  from another nearby hotel  
N =>  Good Experience With most of the hotels in the city charging sick amounts of money for this weekend  Sahara was        yikes   we decided to stay off the strip for once  Paid      at Candlewood  Prepaid online  check in took about   minutes  Fitness room is satisfactory  didn t use  or even see  the pool  We had a good experience  The room was clean  the hotel was quiet  We had a car  and traffic wasn t bad this weekend  so getting around wasn t a problem  The in room kitchen was well stocked and downstairs  the  quot candlewood cupboard quot  had what we needed as far as snacks and drinks  I guess I don t have much to say about this hotel  other than there was nothing negative  There is no maid service  but we stayed there   nights  No big deal  We would definitely stay here again on an expensive weekend  but I would personally prefer to stay on the strip  so that at  am I can just waltz downstairs and see to my poker fix  I probably saved more money staying here as a result  
N =>   AVIOD THIS DUMP AT ALL COSTS    As soon as we walked in  we noticed the entire place smelled funny  No maid service at all  you must bring dirty towels to the front desk and exchange them   The  quot suite quot  was no more than a standard room with the  quot full kitchen quot  crammed into one corner of the room  The bed was hard and lumpy  the recliner was broken  and the A C was so noisy it drowned out the sound of planes on approach  The last straw was when the Steve the Front Desk Guy  the most unprofessional and rude hotel employee I have ever encountered  told me to  quot keep my wife on a leash quot  when she called to complain about the noise coming from the next room  We have NEVER been treated so rudely at a hotel  Luckily we were able to get a room at the Residence Inn across the street  It was a little more expensive  but you get what you pay for  Do NOT waste your hard earned on this place   
N =>  My Non Stay at Candlewood Suites Las Vegas Ok  here goes  uary  nd          I was sent to Vegas to assist a major Retail store  All of this was booked through their corporate website  When I arrived in Vegas  I went to go check in and was politely told that my credit card had been declined  I asked how much they were pre authorizing and they told me that it was             nights stay   I then told them that I did not have that much on any of my credit cards but would be more than happy to pay cash right then and there  No   quot Without the credit card being charged  how would we know that the company reserved the room and I wasn t trying to get a discount  quot   quot WHAT  Are you kidding me  I m in Vegas and you don t accept CASH  quot  Not only did I HAVE to have         on my credit card  they would hold the funds for up to    days and when I checked out  I could pay cash if necessary  So  they are going to hold my credit card hostage and at the end of   days  I would pay them cash  Total outlay of         for    days with a refund of         in   more days  No thanks  I came back later that night  a little calmer and just wanted the room  I was then told that my reservation had been cancelled and that they would not rent a room without a credit card WITH         in funds  I was told that   quot You could go to a lesser hotel that accepts cash   La Quinta next door  quot  Never  ever  EVER will I stay at this hotel and I will recommend to any and all credit strapped travelers to avoid this place  In addition  I will recommend to the company that I work for never to reserve this hotel  Sorry that I didn t have anything good to write about this place  By the way   I m sitting in my room at La Quinta typing this  La quinta isn t that bad  AND for        less  what more do I need  Have a great time  just not at Candlewood Suites  Las Vegas  
N => Great value I used my points for a one Friday night stay  Located about      miles from the Strip  Very clean  Full kitchen  stove  fridge  Fridge did not work when I got in  I had to reset the circuit breaker located inside the room  it beat waiting for maintenance  Some youths located outside were trying to slip in the side door to  quot sell some papers quot   They looked healthy enough but obviously pawns in some sort of scam  Hey it s Vegas  Baby  Otherwise the place was fine  You could hear some constant walking upstairs but the A C mostly drowned it out  Starbucks and Bahama Breeze across the street  
N =>   Couldn t pay me to stay here again    After reading some of the other reviews on here  I m kind of flabbergasted  I wish my experience here was as good as others  When we arrived my husband checked us in  The front desk staff was rude  demanding and relatively incapable  She would not give directions as to where our hotel room was  so we ended up driving around the hotel checking doors to see where our room was  Not so fun after an   hour drive when you have to pee  We asked for a non smoking room  with a king bed  We were never informed that they don t have king size beds  and were promptly given a DOUBLE bed instead  I m sorry  two adults in a double bed is never comfy  especially not when your heavier as my husband and I are  The  non smoking  room WREAKS of cigarette smoke  the air conditioning is just as loud as the jets going over head  Which by the way  it seems like they are going to land in your room they are so loud  No housekeeping for less than   days  you have to change your own sheets  take out your own trash  and buy your own cleaning supplies if you want the bathroom cleaned  The rooms are very  dank   with the walls pained a yellowed version of  off white   Besides the bed being very small  comfortable is definately NOT a word I d use to describe it  Even the linens feel like sandpaper  Also we had to rearrange furniture in order to access both sides of the bed  I ve stayed in many hotels throughout the country  everything from motel   to Crowne Plaza  This is by FAR the worst hotel I ve stayed in  If my husbands work wasn t paying for this  and it was pre paid  we d be out of here in a hot second  Motel   is better than this place   by a long shot  Don t waste your time  your money  or your effort in trying to deal with this place  
N =>  This place is a old dump  I stayed for a week of business  They gave my non smoking room away  and gave me a smoking room  They were packed and could not change me to a non smoking room  Except for this horrible screw up  the staff was very good  and the drinks in the in hotel store  were cold and cheap  My stay  quot sucked quot  and then I had to fax my receipt  to receive my points The Holiday Inn Express was much better  
N => take your own cleaning products Staying there a week  take your own cleaning products with you  We were there   nights and they never gave room service to clean the bathroom  Yuck  It was alright that I had to change my own sheets at my request and turn in soiled towels at the front desk  But if they want their visitors to do everything     then please leave them some cleaning products to clean the bathrooms  
N =>  Facilities Good   Soundproofing Bad Agree with most reviews BUT not the ones that say QUIET  UNLESS you get the top floor  We initially asked for a quiet room and got one on  rd floor where we were wakened by people on the move above at   and   am  presumably after returning late from the casinos Pool area was ok to sun bathe in but pool had not been cleaned when we were there so did not take the chance of swimming in it  although saw young children doing so  therefore it might be ok We were in La Quinta for  st part of our holiday which is in brochures as an airport hotel with free shuttle but is actually next door to Candlewood Suites  We got a quiet nice room there cheaper but of course it does not have kitchen facilities as Candlewood does but does have maid services which Candlewood does not  
N => Where to start  I have stayed at Candlewood Suites in other cities   always topnotch  especially when travelling with kids  It s great to have a separate bedroom  amp  tv  and the pantry is fantastic The staff at the LV Candlewood were rude  disinterested  and poorly trained  When I first arrived  the lady at the desk was sorting the mail  She stopped that  and started helping me  In the middle of helping me  a man  who I guessed was an extended stay customer  came up to the desk and said hello to her  She then stopped helping me  and began going through the stack of mail again to see if he had mail  This caused her to intermingle the paperwork for my room  and my credit card  in with the mail  not to mention you don t stop helping someone and start helping someone else  I had reserved two rooms  one was not ready yet  I requested that they be together  She said she d try  Eventually when the second room was ready  it was way across the hotel The next morning  I was awakened at  am by very loud Mexican music coming from the room next door  I called the front desk  and they said they would send security     minutes later  still got the Polka Party going on  I called the desk again  who hadn t yet called security  They called me back   minutes later  now awakening my children in the living room  to tell me that no one was in the room next door and apparently an alarm had gone off  They were making keys to get in and turn it off  The radio was most likely set at deafening volumes because the maids turn them on that was while they clean  And by the way  if no one was in that room  why couldn t that have been our second room  Hmmm The second room  on the other side of the hotel  was across from the elevator that dinged VERY loudly all night  When my sisters requested another room the next day  they were assigned a room closer to me   NEXT to another elevator  When they said that would not work  they got a room two floors down and all the way on the other side of the hotel  Nice  The front desk staff were very sarcastic  commenting how they usually charge extra for the bonus of the dinging elevator  and then telling them that they don t know where the elevators are in relation to the rooms  Huh The new room they were assigned  although marked as non smoking  reeked of smoke  and as they were now on the ground floor they could not open the windows to let it air out while we were gone  The next morning  when they went to take showers  the drain backed up We ended up waiting until after  am to check out so we could speak with a day manager  as the general manager was out of town and the night manager was one of the smart alecks that thought the whole situation was amusing  The day manager was very polite and gave us a discount and an apology  but   out of    staff is not great odds   even in Vegas Here s a hint for the staff   when someone tells you that they either  a didn t sleep last night because    or  b  were woken up early because      that means they are working on limited sleep  and are not going to react well to wisecracks and flippant remarks  
N => great place to stay  
N =>  The best place in Las Vegas to avoid smoky rooms  
N => We really liked this hotel   
N => Business Ok Leisure dont   
N =>  A comforable stay  
N =>   A Nice Surprise   Clean  Great value for the money if you want to stay on the strip but have a lot more money in your pocket to gamble with  The rooms have been recently remodeled   very clean and with comfortable bed linens and flat screen TV  While the room   rate exceeded my expectations  there were a few downsides to this hotel  First   if you will have a vehicle  be prepared to experience a small challenge getting into out of the hotel s parking facility  It has direct access onto the strip  good   but without any type of pedestrian traffic control  bad   This means you will have to wait unitl one or two or fifty kind souls stop walking to let your car pass  On the other hand  if you don t have a vehicle   you can t beat the convenience or the price Second   most of the rooms appear to face into the service areas for Casino Royale and Harrah s  Our  quot view quot  was of Harrah s employees smoke break area and vendor delivery areas  Heard various delivery trucks in and out throughout the night  But   how often are you in your room in Vegas  anyways Third   the windows have very nice plantation shutters   look really nice  but do not block out the sun like the traditional black out window coverings you find in most Vegas hotels Overall  a pleasant  quot budget quot  stay on the strip this time around  but will probably not return based simply on vehicle access   but if you are going the shuttle cab walking route  you can t beat the value and convenience of staying on the strip for under     night  
N =>   Fabulous Budget Option   right on the strip  Wow  what a find This little hotel was great right in the middle of the strip We were travelling at Xmas time and it was really expensive everywhere else but this hotel was fabulous  In a small casino next to McDonalds on the strip  The rooms were clean and spacious and had two queen beds i would stay here again in a heartbeat as a cheaper option  
N =>  Casino Royale Is The Worst Place To Stay We had such a bad time there  First when we got there we the room smelled like smoke  We ignored it and thought we wouldnt be in the hotel anyway  left a window open and enjoyed vegas  That was the first the second night we were there  our entire cieling where the front door in our room is  that entire area was leaking water all of our clothes and electronics was soaked  Turns out that the guy above us fell asleep in his tub and left the water running  To this day the management said that they are not responsible and told us tough luck  The management and staff are horrible and do not take care of their guests  
N =>   Excellent surprise  After reading the reviews  I was worried about staying here  But as soon as I entered the room  all my fears disappeared  Our room       was recently renovated   everything was new and very clean  Bed was super comfortable  flat screen TV was nice to watch  bathroom was spic and span  and sleeping was a breeze with no real noise Perfect location right in the heart of the strip  with food and fun nearby  I m not a casino afficionado  so can t say how this compares  But we enjoyed a few free cocktails at the slot machines and had some laughs We overheard a manager talking about trying to get their stars increased  so stay here while you can before the rates go up  
N =>  great location great price Our stay at Casino Royale was fine  The location and price can t be beat  We even had a fridge in our room  We would stay here again  
N =>   Great Stay  It started out really bad  I had asked for an upper floor smoking  When I enter the bathroom the tub had this black gunk by the drain  I walked into the sleep area to use the phone and the bed was not made  it was stripped of sheets  everything  I called and went back to the main desk  I did not get a smoking room but the room the desk person gave me was very nice  He was sweet  told me I could move to a smoking room the next day but I told him I will stay in the one he gave me  the room was great  If you have to smoke there are areas on the same floor that have a bench and a big ash can  The cocktail waitresses are not as nice as they used to be  I think I saw their supervisor giving one of them hell   she was sweet to me  not a great thing to do right in front of patrons  I wouldn t be happy working there either if that s how she treats staff  The waitresses I have met in the past two years have been really nice   too bad they left Casino Royale  Great place to stay  I felt safe  it is clean and best of all  right in the middle of the strip  I always stay here and I visit Vegas at least twice a year  
N => Don t Book this One This hotel was awful  The carpet was filthy  the sitting chairs were filthy  THe bathroom was the only clean area in the room  It was hard to even locate how to get in and up to the check in desk after being dropped off by the shuttle car  The hotel stay was given to me   but I would never book this hotel  It is equal to a Motel   or less  Don t book this one  
N =>  Don t Stay Here  Horrible   Ok  so the only thing good about this hotel was the convience to bigger and nicer hotels  All and All this hotel sucked   It was hot  smelled old  you couldn t really get away from the smoke from the downstairs casino  We were on the  nd floor  Saw a Roach that fell down in the light fixture  Gross  The comforter was old  thin  torn and had cigarette holes in it  The bed was soggy and had plastic on it  Worst sleep ever and I was dead tired  TV was a    inch analog cable televsion that didn t get a good picture  It cut in and out by moving the cable wire  I guess the bathroom was OK    Clean  but our tub was stopped up where water was coming up to your ankles  EEK  We did call and a guy came and fixed it within   minutes  So that was good  I guess  It looks decent from the outside  but it is like an old MOTEL   that hasn t been updated since         in the back side of it  There is no valet parking like the other hotels  Horrible  I haven t seen an elevator that old ever  You get lost trying to find out where you check in to the hotel  There are no signs and no is around to help you find it  The phone was so old  and It was way across the room where usually they are on the nightstand  It had this small kitchen area  that had a fridge i think and a safe  No Iron  had to request it So i guess all and all  if you want a crappy hotel just to sleep in during a vegas trip  pick this one  But if you really want to experience all the cool things that the other hotels would offer  go somewhere else  You know like a fitness room  spa  pool   wireless interent  shops and resturants  They had no room service or any resturants inside the hotel So my recommendations to stay in Vegas if you want a nice time are the Luxor  Wynn  Mandalay Bay  Ceaser s Palace  MGM Grand  Venetian  PLanet Hollywood  Just any of the main big ones Bally s and Flamingo didn t look so hot either  I am not sure about Harrah s  That s my review  my very first one b c I just HAD to tell others   Anomynous 
N =>   Cheap  We stayed for   nights at the end of ch       a Fri  amp  Sat   The reason picked Casino Royale was mainly price and location  We were looking at booking about     months before we arrived and at the same time   prices for strip hotels were at least DOUBLE or more since weekends are most expensive  we paid     US night and booked through TravelWorm  We were sceptical about booking through a lesser known website like Travelworm  but we did a lot of research and found out that they are based out of LasVegas  Plus the person we talked to was knowledgable and friendly  There were no problems with the booking  Booking though the website was cheaper than booking directly   even IF you had AAA Location can t be beat considering the price  A downside is that taxis can not or do not want to stop here to pick people up  We waited    hr on Sunday for a taxi to come  after calling and recalling   times  The only reason we got a taxi was that one was dropping off people and we happened to flag it down in time  A word of advice  either don t bother calling for a taxi  have your own car   or walk to the next big hotel  not a short walk either   to catch a taxi  Close to the Venetian  amp  Harrahs  across from the Mirage  Denny s  Outback  and some other fast food type places close by  About the accomodations Check in   located within the casino    slighty hard to find    quick though  under    minutes for everything Room  we stayed on the fourth floor  the very furthest room down the hallway  it was a long hike  but we re into exercise and didn t really mind  unfortunately this particular room did NOT have a fridge like it should ve   Safe was available   Room cleanliness was decent  didn t notice any weird smells    only the middle elevator was working    Since we were at the end of the hall  we had no problems with noise Beds  ok  we aren t very particular and can fall asleep on anythingBathroom   brightly lit  decently clean  good water pressure   nothing fancy here  but was adequatePool  we didn t use  looked small  but I suppose if you were the only ones using it it would be ok Other  Ice maker was decent  didn t have to wait too long for a large amount of ice   we didn t have a fridge and therefore had to resort to the ice in the sink method of keeping out drinks cold In summary  this would be the hotel for people that are not that picky about where they stay  If you re looking for fancy room service  spa service  big pool etcetc  don t bother here  If you just want a room to sleep in while you are touring the strip  the price and location will more than justify your stay  
N =>  Bosnian Goat Ranch This was my first time in Vegas  but THANK GOD Casino Royale wasn t my first experience in accommodations  Fortunately  we were able to have spent the first night of a   day stay in the Hard Rock Cafe  which I would fully recommend to anyone But let s get about the Casino Royale  To put the positive before the negative  I will have to say that the location is ideal  which is probably the reason this place stays in business   It s centrally located on the strip  and fairly accessible to just about anywhere you d like to go  In addition to this  the casino itself is fairly compact  but fun  if you re in to low rent  down to earth  friendly dealer  etc   Blackjack switch is a fun game  that improves your odds slightly  but costs considerably higher to play  because you re forced to play two hands instead of one Now the negative  I ll list them numerically so as to be sure I capture them all    The Smell  The entire place smells of urine and smoke  And the ventilation is HORRIBLE  The AC did not work  I read about this in a different review as well  so evidently it s commonplace at this hotel    The Accomodations  The beds were uncomfortable  the rooms were dank and musty  the bathroom fixtures  namely the shower head  were coming out of the wall  and the rooms were dirty as ever   in fact  we found several long  black hairs in the shower that were evidently overlooked in the last  quot cleaning quot    The Noise  Some construction was occurring in the parking lot behind us  and as much as I like the sound of clanging wood and metal in the morning  I did grow rather tired of the      rock radio station that was playing    The Accessibility  I know   a contradiction to my previous statement about the location   but I m talking ACCESSIBILITY  This place is so difficult to turn in to  that a few cab drivers even refused to pick us up when they discovered our destination  I m not kidding  it takes a      cab fare just to make the right turn from a block away  Once you get in the door  it s even more difficult to get to your room   the hallways are extremely long  and when we were there  one of the elevators was out of service  In short  we had to pass through a clear glass door  that wouldn t open half the time  no matter how many times you swiped your card   up one flight of stairs  down a long smelly hallway  into the elevator  up two floors  back down the smelly hallway and into your room  UGH   We found so many things wrong with this place  and were so outright DISGUSTED by the hotel in general  that we humorously named the place  quot The Bosnian Goat Ranch quot  after staying there for one night  and commonly referred to it as such for the remainder of our stay Two stars   one for location  one for the entertaining low rent casino  Everything else is worth the extra     to go elsewhere  
N => You get what u pay for  It was my   st b day and there was nowhere to stay that was decent looking  We decided to stay at casino royale for its location  We get the room its ok looking everything basic u need  Then I i went straight to the bed and it was very uncomfortable and noisy  Then at night you can hear workers from Harrah s making alot of noise throughout the night with very loud music  Also the ac did not work but it did make alot of noise  To top it off the rooms keys did not work  And if they dont work u cannot even get inside the building where the rooms are  I stayed for    mins until someone had a key to let me in  Overall I would not stay here again  You can pay    dls more for a better stay  
N =>  Great Place To Stay  We stayed   nights at Casino Royale and we will be staying there again  in ember  The location couldn t be more perfect and there s NO way you can beat the price  Granted  if you re looking for  quot flashy quot  or opulance  then you may be disappointed  but really   if you go to Vegas  WHY would you want to spend so much time in your room that it would make a difference   We spent most of our time enjoying the sights of Las Vegas  not sitting in our room The rooms were spotless  The staff was friendly and very helpful  We were very comfortable  never having to be concerned about security as we felt safe at all times  We don t really gamble  so I can t say the casino itself was good or bad  but people seemed to enjoy themselves there  We went to several shows and all of them were a comfortable walking distance from the hotel    everything was  actually  And the things we went to that were off the strip  we needed only to walk across the street and the busses were there every few minutes  Honestly  you can t go wrong at Casino Royale All in all   we highly recommend Casino Royale and will be very happy to go back again in emner  
N =>   Okay  My husband and I stayed at the Casino Royale over the tin Luther King Jr  weekend  We are in our    s We booked a room there because it was the only place that was on the strip that had a reasonable rate for that particular weekend The Hotel nothing fancy  a bit rundown  perfect for folks who don t care too much about imageThe Hallways a little creepyThe Room average  refridgerator and safe a big plus  carpet looks old  pillows were extremely comfortable  furniture old  only channels one thru fourteen  not as clean as it could be  doors to rooms not secure enough   they look like people have tried to break into them before  was not overly comfortable being alone in the room at night while my husband was at the casino   no view to speak ofThe Casino extremely smoky  young crowd my husband enjoyed the casino  The Employees everyone I came in contact with could not have been nicer  from Reggie who checked us in  to the security guard  to the folks selling the clothes in the front lobby  the dealers and waitresses  the folks at Denny s right next doorOverall price was terrific for a holiday weekend on the strip in a good location  across from Mirage   next to Venetian AAA discount availablevery few amenitiesperfect place for a bachelor partyI would likely not stay here again because it is not the right place for me but I m sure some folks would think it was just fine 
N =>   Not Good    The Casino Royale was a TERRIBLE experience for us  I m glad it was not the first time we have visited Vegas because we would NEVER go back The Hotel was dirty and smelled the room was a good size but DIRTY The Casino was very DIRTY also and the people that work there are VERY rude There was alot of other thing s that happend     too many to type All I can say is spend a little more    and stay elsewhere   The next time we go we will go back to the Sahara  
N => OK rooms timeshare  deal  a ripoff We stayed at the casino royale because we were offered a  quot deal quot  by the Tahiti Village timeshare company  The rooms were clean   better than I expected  We had constant problems with our room keys  however  Also  I have been charged more than I was promised by the timeshare company  and the free slot machine play they offer must be done only on their  quot promotional machines  quot  on which you can not cash out unless you hit a jackpot  One employee told us that they had only seen two winners on these machines the entire time they worked there  These are also the machines that you must play when you join their  quot club quot  and get     free play  In addition  other offers that the timeshare company promised were not as they were explained to me  Overall  the rooms are fine and a good deal       DO NOT book there because you get a  quot good deal quot  from Tahiti Village       this is a waste of time and is not a good deal   except for the room discount  which I have not yet recieved   the extra stuff they offer is not worth it  If I had to do it over  and could find a room on the strip for       dollars more a night  I would do it  Otherwise  the room is fine   clean  very basic  
N => no frills good deal A great place for the low roller  Great location and price  Room was older but clean  Not the place if you are seeking up scale LV  But if you want to keep your lodging cost down this is the place to go  Make sure you get a casino card  Very modest play will get you free rooms in the future and comps now  
N =>  OK But Not Great The only reason we stayed there was because some friends we were going to be meeting up with had already chosen the place  We have stayed at Stardust  Riviera and Imperial Palace  so you can see we don t have real expensive tastes  Our first impression was the place is extremely dark and uninviting  We decided before we even checked in that we wouldn t stay there again  I originally made reservations for   non smoking rooms  When I called to cancel one of the rooms  I found that they had reserved   non smoking and one smoking  I m pretty sure when I asked about AAA or any other discounts I was told there weren t any  When checking in  they asked if anyone in either room had AAA  Only one person had brought their card  Unfortunately  that card could only be used for the room that person was in  So even though there were   AAA members in the other room who didn t have their cards  they wouldn t accommodate  The husband of one of the members faxed a copy of their card and on checkout  they almost didn t accept it because HIS name was on the card rather than HERS  They changed it so he was listed as the guest  We found most of the employees there to be not very friendly or particularly helpful  The cashiers are not happy when you request quarters rather than use their new ticket system  In fact  the first time we asked  they told us that only   machines in the whole place even took quarters  which is not true  Overall  the rooms were fine   clean and comfortable  It is a very small casino and the rooms are a short walk  The elevator was always right there when we rang for it  We only had to share it once  Also nice  is having so many restaurant choices in one place  Denny s was very accommodating to our    person group for breakfast  
N =>  Perfect place for the younger crowd  We have been to LV numerous times  staying at hotels such as Excalibur  MGM  Bally s  Imperial Palace and Caesers  This last time we stayed at Casino Royale  I was a little apprehensive of staying there  but my boy friend was insistent  During all of our trips to Vegas  we had ended up playing at this casino the most  The tables are cheap  the drinks are strong  and the slots actually pay out  Anyway  as I said  I was scared there would be cockroaches in my bed and fought with my boy friend over staying there  but he won in the end  People in reviews complained that the front desk was hard to find  and the lines were long and blah blah blah  We arrived there at   am  check in is not until   pm  They allowed us to check in at       when they cleaned the room  The room was a nice size  it wasn t Bellagio  but the bed was huge  CA Kind I believe  and really really comfortable  There was a refrigerator  a nice little bar  a closet and a nice size bathroom  The rooms look away from the strip  so you don t hear the noise at night  Also  you are in VEGAS  you are there to play  have fun  walk around see the hotels  honestly how many hours do you really spend in your hotel    We slept about   hours a night  the rest of the time we were enjoying our selves  This hotel houses mainly the younger crowd  Tons of people under    mixed in with strong alcoholic drinks makes a really fun atmosphere  Remember  you are there to have fun  not to stay in your hotel room       For the price of this hotel  the location of it  and the strong drinks and loose tables and slots  this was an awesome place  We will stay there again next year  and I hate to admit this  but my boy friend was right  for once   
N => Nice Experience  
N => Terrible service rude dealers  
N =>   This Place ROCKS   
N =>  rip off  
N => great location cheap no extras but close to everything  
N =>  The place to stay  
N => Disaster My daughter and family stayed   nights at Circus  Circus in Las Vegas  It was a total disappoint from past experiences  Normal amenities i e   refrig   Microwave cost extra per day  rooms not very clean  elevator broken  had to walk flight of stairs to get to room  Talked to desk receptionist and Supervisor you were very unprofessional and sympathic  Not  quot kid friendly quot  as advertised and family setting as in prior years and staff was very rude in some instances  I will not nor will we ever recommend a staff in the Circus  Circus Las Vegas  There were many families attending a Football tournament  Next year we will stay elsewhere  
N => Cheap but    Somewhat out of the way for being  quot on the strip quot   The price was right though and if you like clowns  well then you ll love this place  Room was pretty basic  if not dated  Room was quiet  Shower floor was uneven which felt somewhat odd    I don t know if I d stay here again but in a pinch  it s not a bad choice for a Vegas hotel  
N =>   Newly Renovated Rooms are Great  We wanted something cheap for Vegas  as we were going to be running around all day and weren t planning on staying much in the hotel  However  I wanted to stay somewhere nice and not in a dump  I saw online that Circus Circus had a stay three nights get the fourth night free AND we could stay in the NEWLY renovated tower  I was skeptical up until the time when we opened the door to our room  The main lobby and casino are dark and dreary but when we got to our room   it was very nice  Modern furniture  art work  new bedding  armchair and flat screen tv  The room itself was huge  The view wasn t much   overlooking the back parking lot  The a c barely ran     it was a little sneeze of a breeze  however we left it on all day and it seemed to cool the room down  Our room was at the end of the hall so the noise was very minimal  We never heard our neighbors or the people above us   so that was a nice thing too  They also have an in room safe  which was a welcome addition The Steakhouse Restaurant in the hotel casino is not to be missed   exceptional service and well worth the money we spent  We went for our anniversary dinner  It was great  The rest of the dining options left much to be desired There are no places to sit and read a book or enjoy a glass of wine while your partner plays the tables     so if you want to relax you have to go to your room  Which was disappointing  It would be nice if they had some decent lounges The casino as I said is dark and I felt a little claustrophobic in there  Other hotel casinos were much more open airy and didn t feel as constricting  Trying to find your way around was crazy  One man on the elevator said he had to go up two floors  get off and then walk down the hall to catch another elevator to get to where he was going  Trying to find the pool was impossible and the hours were even more ridiculous  It is about a    minute walk  if you re a walker  to go about     of a mile down the strip to the Fashion Show Mall area  It was fine for us I would only recommend and stay at this hotel if you can reserve a room in the newly renovated section   the rest of the property leaves much to be desired  
N =>   cheap and cheerful Upgraded to a normal room  were allocated a motel  and everything was fine  Nothing special but nothing bad  just a nice cheap and cheerful hotel   
N =>   Fantastic  would stay there again and would recommend We booked Circus Circus as it was cheap so we would therefore have more spending money  We looked at the reviews beforehand and saw it got vbad reviews we left not expecting anything fantastic  A friend told us to always ask for an upgrade on check in as they normally will always upgrade you  We did this on check in and they said they have given us one of the best rooms as we booked with them direct rather through another site so we got prioty  worth remembering  they also upgraded our friend who was checking in that day to the same floor and to a similar suite  The guy at check in also said that some parts of the hotel have been refurbished and we stayed in the north tower which had been refurbushed  I think he said the west tower also was also nice We checkend into our room and my jaw it the floor   the room was incrediable and HUGE   and to think we only paid        per night we were on to a right bargin  It was very clean also The Buffet was the cheapest we found on the strip     per day which was fantasic  Yes   like in other reviews the food was a little dry but still nice and they had plenty of choice and their fresh baked breads and stuff were fresh same with the fruit  amp  veg  If your expecting good service then your not going to get it in Las Vegas  We didn t get the same standard of customer service as elsewhere in the states  but they were polite and got what you wanted  so we have no complaints  Location wise you are a little away from the centre of the strip   which we liked as there was no noise when you wanted to go to sleep so you can take it or leave it  Everything just a very short walk away  Loved this hotel for the        per night we paid for the room     Wouldn t try another hotel as this suited us perfectly   Just make sure your room is in one of the re furbished towers and you on to a winner   
N =>    st Time in Vegas   Never again This was the second worst hotel I have stayed in  Worn out  old   not kept up and worst of all  not clean  Stains in the carpets  engravings on doorways  dead flies in the bathroom fixture  I would not recommend this facility  
N =>   Very Friendly Staff and Hotel But too many kids  We went to Las Vegas for the  st time in      and stayed at Circus Circus as a part of package deal to go to the Grand Canyon  From the moment we checked in the staff were nothing short of top notch  Giving us good advice  Guilding us around such a big place   We have nothing like this in Australia I put my hand up here for not doing my homework as i didnt know the place would be packed with kids  But hey i should of noticed the title of the Casino i was staying at  The Casino itself was quite nice  It had a Acrade   a Krispy Kreme  For us big kids   The place was always pretty clean  The Buffet was a bit average though  Internet was good for sending an email to loved ones back home  Gotta watch out for people trying to sell you stuff near Adventure Dome and when you walk down towards the South of the Strip you get bullied by TimeShare idiots  So just watch out we ended up being conned to going to a TimeShare thing and it took   hours out of our day The Rooms were okay  Not a great view but not bad for someone on a budget this is the place for you We are going back to Vegas in       and Will Visit this place again  Not to stay but just to see whats going on  
N =>  kids loved staying in circus circus and we liked it s casino  We have two kids  We planed our trip with another family with kids so that we could take care of them turn by turn and enjoy the shows and playing at casinos  Our trip was awesome  It couldn t be better than that with four kids Circus Circus is the perfect place to stay if you have kids and have to go to vegas without wasting money to have some sleep    because It s Veagas  
N =>   Not a great place to stay The circus circus hotel is just medicore  The manor rooms which are priced       less than the tower rooms are really not part of  quot circus circus quot   They are about     feet away across the street and good luck walking all the way from the front desk which is located in the tower to these manor rooms  If I go next time   I would much rather prefer the tower rooms though they are little more expensive The rooms in manor are kind of okay but not great  They just do the job if you need a place to sleep and take shower  Don t stay in this hotel if you want to spend quality time at your honeymoon  But if you are looking for something really cheap this place is fine The free circus shows in the Casino are pretty good given that they are  quot free quot   The casino itself is not upscale  The smoke really gets into you at   a m in the morning  I don t think they have any system in place to control smoke 
N =>   Walmart Resort      Let me be fair in saying that the service and cleanliness was very good  I personally could not get past parents exposing thier children to smoking  intoxicated slutty dressed women  kids waiting for thier parents to stop gambling  the barage of pornographic material that litters the strip and every street corner  including the one right out front of this so called family friendly resort  and poor air quality from the smokers  If you are a conscious parent you will not even think about bringing your children to Las Vegas  I would not  The hotel is very dated and the rooms desperatly need updating  But as I said  the service was very good and it was clean  
N =>   WONDERFUL TRIP My partner took me to Las Vegas for my   th Birthday and we had a fabulous time  We had read bad reviews about the hotel before we arrived so were a bit wary  However we need not have worried  We arrived at   pm in the evening and were given all relevant information about hotel  including a map which is very useful  We were initially given a smoking room but as soon as we told them neither of us smoked it was changed  We were on the   th floor of the tower which had a great view down towards Freemont  The room was spacious and had plenty of room to store clothes  We asked for an extra pillow which arrived within the hour  Towels were changed every day and room kept spotless  I am a very fussy eater but this hotel provided everything from a quick snack to a full meal  The all day  all you can eat  buffet was tremendous value at     each  It runs from   am to    pm which allows for an evening snack if required  It consists of food from various regions both at breakfast  you could have   courses if required  and dinner  we never stayed in for lunch but took fruit and rolls in the morning which we took with us  which included a carvery style section of turkey  beef and ham  Admittedly there was not much choice of potatoes but there was veg and also a comprehensive salad bar which could be utilised  There was soup to start with  the salad bar  various desserts and an ice cream machine  fresh fruit  drinks  cakes pastries  I really do not know what people expect from a buffet but we were very satisfied  There are plenty of other reasonably priced choices for food throughout the hotel including McDonalds and Subway  We played the slots in the Casino but there was little else by way of entertainment  We also took advantage of the   day bus pass obtained right outside the hotel which allowed endless travel up and down the strip  Before our retirm home the Business Centre in the hotel arranged our boarding passes for the three return flights home and also contacted the limo company taking us back to the airport  Admittedly there was a    charge for this but it gave us great peace of mind to enjoy our last day  This hotel may not have the glamour of some other hotels on the strip but we found the atmosphere very relaxing and all staff friendly and helpfu  I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone  
N =>  DO NOT EAT AT THE BUFFET     But however    Do NOT for any reason eat at this buffet after   PM like we did    Friday night we met family for a late dinner and they decided they wanted to eat at the buffet because they served shrimp  Well  what wasn t burned was raw  the selection was very small not appetizing at all  The turkey was good and I stuck to that  Since it was closing time they were shutting down half of the buffet  Most of the partons were seated on the closed side while a couple of others were on the side where the food was served  You could tell that everyone wanted to go home   no one picked up our plates until they were stacked   or   high on our table  It was disgusting    However  we stayed on the strip because we got a great price for three nights           I didn t expect too much for the price    but our room was clean and we had great housekeeping  cleaned well every day  Our room was old and needed brighter light bulbs but was clean and the beds were comfortable     th floor in the Main Tower  The first night we gambled until   am and walked away with more money than we started with and that continued for the rest of the weekend  All and all it was a great stay  the buffet was really our only complaint  
N =>  Other than the indoor theme park it s just a mediocre hotel  As usual rooms in USA are huge for average Asian sizes like us  Room facilities are as per normal  nothing spectacular as compared to hotels in ASEAN  amp  far east  The theme park is within a huge dome solely built for this uniqueness  Frankly  not many types of rides are available but could be a one day joy for children to spend  Plenty of restaurants but food are just so so  could be better   amp  not cheap for a hotel on The Strip  Depending on the needs of families  I would only recommend this hotel to those whose kids enjoy thrill rides  
N =>  Hotel service for hostel price Expected very little   especially for the price we paid  around    euros per person per night   and was very suprised  large clean room on the   rd floor that was perfectly cleaned every day  fresh towels  new soap  amp  shampoo every day as well   Room looked recently renovated with good beds  amp  large LCD television  Sure  it s not as luxury as the Strip superhotels  but for the price of a hostel in any European city  I didn t expect it to be  Would certainly recommend this place  
N =>   Value for Money   yeah right Front of house service invented the meaning of draging your chain  after waiting close to   hour to check  there was only    couples in front of us   we discover the room was only set up for    We sent a message to room service to requesting extra towels as we had   in the room and went out for the day  we came back to the room about   hours later to discover that no extra towels had been sent up  we had to call another   times over a   hour period to finally get our towels  then they put out the hand for a tip        just typical for the place Food was o k Note to hotel  if you are going to put slot machines in your green zone  area your children can walk through  and children stop and watch then don t start harrassing them  and don t ever call them bother or sister 
N =>   Sub Average    We spent six nights at the hotel  We stayed because the price was one of the cheapest  But you get what you pay for  We had a long line to wait in for check in on a Monday evening when we arrived  When we finally were checked in  we discovered you can t just use a bell cart to bring things from the car lot to your hotel room  which is at least a       minute walk depending on where your room is  You have to use the bell person and they expect tips  So we did the work ourselves  Then we found that we only had a few TV channels  no cable  or HBO free  No internet free  anywhere  you have to use a credit card or pay for it  this is true almost all the places on the Vegas strip  Food is not cheap like it used to be  Buffet s are anywhere from       a plate  McDonalds are everywhere  including in the Circus Circus hotel  We checked in  and walked around the hotel  only to find that the Adventuredome and pools close at  pm  So entertainment in the evening at this hotel consists of bars  or the casino  Even the midway trapeeze circus acts end early  The pools are small  and lacking compared to the other hotels in the area  They are right next to the road so you get to view the traffic  We upgraded our room from the most basic to the tower for    more a night  but they were not upgraded yet  so the bed was very uncomfortable  you could feel every spring in the bed  We called for extra pillows and the housekeeping said they had a restriction on pillows because they were running low  The next day we went to the Adventuredome only to find out that the water log ride was closed for repairs  It remained closed the rest of the trip  For the price it was a room and bed to sleep in  We spent most the remainder of the trip elsewhere on the strip  
N =>   Not Gay Friendly My Partner and i Checked in to our room which was very nice with a view of the StripI needed to pick up some mail and when i enquired the Staff member made a number of Anti gay comments to his co worker with a Smirk on his face  these comments were directed at us and made us feel un welcomed The next night we ate at the buffet  UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH DON T EAT IN THE BUFFET YOU WILL GET FOOD POISIONING LIKE WE DID     When we complained about the quality of the food the Staff we rude and said What did we expect for a Buffet We had a great time In Vegas and we will return for another visit but we will not stay HERE  
N =>   Disappointed The service and hospitality left a lot to be desired  Instead of dealing with our complaints  they gave a list of excuses instead  Our particular room was like Motel   quality and we were told we were in the new section  Several of the elevators didn t work correctly  We paid to stay at this particular hotel and couldn t get decent parking  Overall it was a big disappointment and like they say   quot You Get What You Pay For quot   
N =>   well worth the price we paid stayed at circus circus for   nights at begining of october      Arrived quite late at night ast here was a delay with our flight due to weather at jfk airport new york  so atleast we didnt have to cue up at reception  Our room was loverly  large  with   big double beds dont know why as we only needed one The hotel is a little bit out the way from the main strip but there is a bus stop just outside the hotel which we used through out the holiday    for    hours  was disapointed to find the fair ground inside the hotel only opened at wkend so didnt get to see it   We didnt really use our hotel facilitys as most of our time was spent down at the main strip useing the posh hotels facilitys weather was warm just wore shorts all day   even night time wasnt that cold  watched a couple of shows while we where there  American superstars was really good the micheal jackson look alike was excelent and the lion king was really good  get your tickets at one of the many tix booths for all last minute shows  some half price will defo go to vegas again  
N =>   A good place to stay if you have kids Located on the strip  the hotel itself was crowded when we visited in       but the rooms were good and clean  The beds were nice and comfortable  Its a good place to stay especially when you are just going to come back to the hotel to sleep after you day of sightseeing  There are some activities for children too so that they can enjoy  Overall a pleasant stress free stay  
N =>  Would not stay there again  The room had NO extras     not even a coffee pot and the hair dryer  which I guess was the only extra  only blew cold air  The Buffet was the worst I ve ever been to in vegas     EVER   
N =>  Very cordial and accomidating When we arrived  we got a free upgrade on the room  they brought us a refrigerator and made sure we had everything we needed 
N =>  get a life moaners Hi first time to vagas stayed in this real awful hotel called circus circus well thats what i was led to believe before i got there some of you lot out there just like to moan i read reviews of this hotel before i left home and i was ready to change hotels i adopted the attitude awwww well i quot m not going to vagas to sit in hotel room hahahahaha The hotel was great and real value for money I never clicked with a lady whilst there so i was not privy to see other hotels rooms so all i can say is circus is great value for money anyone going in the future should not be worried re this hotel and if they get there and its not up to your standard well don quot t book  star hotel and expect Ceasors palace you eejits rooms were quiet apart from my friends snoring hotel was spead out over huge area but was interesting finding your way out eventually location was a short bus trip out  without traffic about   mins i quot d say in traffic about    mins   but that was fine got to meet the locals hahahahahah anyway this hotel is fine and if i couldn quot t afford Ceasors i quot d happily stay here again hope this has eased your worries if you have already read the MOANERS page 
N =>  Overrun with bad service To say this place has bad service would be overstating it  My friend and I booked a couple of tickets to see the FrightDome on opening night           Had issues getting the ticket to print out ahead of time and was told I would need that to get in  I explained I had an email with confirmation number and they still said they would not honor it  Got the runaround then they asked for my cell   to call me back after they  quot looked into it  quot  Never got a call back  Was finally able to get my ticket into the will call booth online  but when we arrived at the hotel by cab there were no signs or advertisements anywhere to get to the FrightDome  We asked many employees and their response was   quot What is the FrightDome  quot  We also purchased the  quot fast pass quot  feature which is supposed to get you in faster through the lines  This was a complete joke and nothing more than to get     more out of you  People with regular tickets were being allowed into the attractions before fast pass holders  There was really no good attitude among the staff working these attractions  and many of them barely spoke English  A completely unorganized  poorly planned event  It had the potential to be really great  but missed the mark completely  Circus Circus  if you are reading this  you better get your act together or you will see the fate of the Dunes  Landmark and the Sands  I have not stayed at Circus Circus  but after this experience on the North Strip  I doubt I ever will  
N =>  The food was average and the room was decent  I stayed in Room     on the  rd floor  The carpet looks worn out and needs to be replaced  I didn t see any security patrolling my room  The door was hard to lock and sometimes it would pop open  You have to slam it to make sure it locks  The food was okay  I regret booking a room there  I should stayed at Treasure Island  
N =>  Not bad for cost considering it s Vegas We stayed here for   nights and managed to find a discounted rate of     per night  which made the whole experience bearable  The Sunrise Tower wasn t that easy to find a way into and it is shabby but the room was OK  No frills but for the cost we didn t expect any  They did charge        for the Internet and we didn t use other facilities which would have also cost  this would have put up the cost of the room considerably  The pool area is wonderful  well worth staying for  We noticed that a phone charge was automatically put on the bill so had to ask for that to be taken off  since we hadn t used the phone  Need sharp eyes  The buffet was a good price but the Subway charged way above what we d been paying for weeks during our travels  in    other States  cost nearly twice as much  That end of Vegas is getting a bit left behind but we enjoyed our time there  wouldn t stay any longer anyway  We ve stayed in more basic places in Vegas in the past so this was OK  
N =>  Perfectly Acceptable Place To Stay I was worried to say the least after having read many pretty awful reviews on this site before departure but on arrival there was no chaos or long lines at check in although they appeared to have no rooms available in the skyrise or casino towers upgraded us to a west tower room  The room was a disabled one and so there was no bath but a huge walk in shower  large comfortable bed  flat screen tv and comfortable chairs and table  I was still a little worried as to the quality of the other rooms as our friends were to join us there in a few days and would unlikely receive an upgrade too but their room in the skyrise tower whilst a little annoying to get to was perfectly clean and comfortable and I could have happily stayed there for the full    days  The   pool areas were adequately equipped and comfortable although I didn t have much time to spend there  the jacuzzi s were wonderfully warm and there was a bar serving drinks and snacks whilst playing music  When I first arrived I thought the hotel was only a stone s throw away from the action on the strip but a few days later and the blisters on my feet told me otherwise  due to the scale of all the hotels everything looks a lot nearer than it actually is and once our friends arrived we pretty much took taxi s everywhere which were very good value as the blasted deuce bus was always full and meant a    minute wait just to board before crawling along in the strip s traffic so for me wasn t really an option after my first attempt  One disappointment was the lack of lounge bars it seemed only possible to have a drink if you were sat in the middle of the casino although this was the case with many hotels  Good hotel for vegas on a budget although next time I ll try and save a little more and splash out for one of my favourites further down the strip  
N =>   Lock the door inside In the early morning of the last night there  I woke up because of a clicking noise and jumped up to see someone opened the door  They closed it right away but I could hear that they opened a wrong room  My mistake was that I forgot to lock the door inside  but if other key cards can open my room then that is really scary That was my mistake but think of the time you are not in the room  someone can open your room easily Key cards are not completely safe as I thought before  I don t know what really happened so I will not rate the hotel on this incident Other than that  everything is fine  
N =>   ent   saves   to spend on shows Stayed with my    year old daughter  We saved quite a bit of    which allowed us to go see Blue Man Crew and Criss Angel Believe  Cirque du Soleil     both shows were amazing There s lots to do inside  Good for kids   especially the Adventuredome rides  My daughter was thrilled that she got to meet Criss Angel  who came to his store inside the casino to sign autographs  and take pictures with guests one day   great guy You have to visit the other ritzy casinos while there   a lot of construction on the strip right now though    I would recommend hoping on one of many buses that peruse up and down the strip all day night    it can be quite a walk if your not up to it  Also  in Vegas its illegal to hail a cab on the street  many cabs were robbed   so you stand in a taxi line at the hotels  which goes quick and really isn t bad at all  Our particular room  in the tower  was ok  but it was hot and the a c turned off automatically after a few minutes  Also  very little in the way of room tv stations and the in room movie ordering didn t work in our room    we finally got one movie to start  but then it cut off     way through  And  the last night of our stay  the room keys cards just stopped working and it took us getting ahold of hotel security to finally let us in our room  Aside from these relatively minor problems  it was fine  
N =>   Circus Circus Las Vegas Nevada We were there to attend a wedding and it was a lot of fun  Can t complain about Circus Circus it was just fine  The hotel rooms are nothing special  we stayed in the tower and I am glad we did  It still was a hike to get out of the casino but not too bad  The pool was ok  For the price I would recommend people give it a try if they are on a budget  
N =>   you get what you pay for hey  we didnt have to pay anything to stay at this hotel  thru credit card points and what not we were able to make reservations for free at this hotel  it wasn t your   star hotel room  but it served its purpose when it came to providing a place to stay  while it was clean  the room smelled like cigarette smoke even tho we asked for a non smoking room  but it had a c  and had a small working refridgerator and the location was good  they also had a small fitness center that we used  which we had to pay   dollars for  per room as opposed to per person   all in all  our stay went well  altho we thought hospitality was on the poor side     but really  how can we complain that much when we got the hotel room for free    
N =>   Bed bugs               Warning     Do not stay here  My husband an I went to Vegas to celebrate our  th anniversary  Our  nd night there I woke up to find       Bed Bugs in the bed where we were sleeping  It was biggest inconvience ever  We had to leave all of our belongings in that room and buy new clothes to keep from bringing the bugs home  We missed out on a day of previously planned activities  already paid for   The compensation only included the replacement of our clothes and luggage which we had to sign a contract for  Three days later I noticed several bumps on me and I am pretty sure they are from the bugs  But nothing could be done because of the contract we signed  I was honest and in the end got screwed  Now I am deathly afraid of bugs and hotels  This is a complete health hazard  If you care about your family  do not stay here  
N =>   a good hotel in a poor location this was our third stay at circus circus  The rooms are standard and very clean  My only main gripe is that the safe costs   c per use  this was a bit annoying when you lock it and then find something else you need locked away  Also with it being a key access safe it didnt seem as secure as the new electronic ones  The air conditioning was a bit noisy switching on and off so we had to sleep with it off  this didnt bother us too much as we re not used to AC anyway This was our first time that we used the pool area and we were pleasantly surprised by it   quot  reasonable sized pools in a clean area tho a little out of the way access wise  to get there u need to take the elevator to the  rd floor  walk to the end of the corridor go through a couple of doors and take another lift to the pool area  The pool remained in the sun all day which surprised me considering its location to the towers Circus is in waking distance of the strip but it is quite a walk  Fashion show mall is only    minutes away but the main bulk of the strip is quite a distance which was annoying in the heat of summer  we went in september not exactly the hottest month   As a group of   we mainly got taxis as it worked out slightly cheaper for us than the bus would have The casino itself is massive and the hotel has   different towers  one of which has recently been redecorated  unfortunately ours wasnt one of the recenty redecorated rooms but it was still clean and comfy  We didn t eat in circus circus very often as there were a lot of other places we wanted to go  We did try the buffet breakfast which was good value and sufficient  We also tried the casino cafe which was also good for a small meal but service was very slow and we were in a hurry  This was our third stay and the first time that the distance bothered me  the first   times we were travelling the  rd was purely leisure  As the strip develops further in this area this again could well become a prime location  if they don t implode it first  
N =>   Too far out of the way This hotel was great value for money  it was clean and served the purpose of a bed for the night  The downside was that it was too far away from everything else on the strip apart from Fashion Show Mall  It took about       mins to walk from the Bellagio  Also the room safe was cash operated  it needed   quarters each time you wanted to lock the safe which was non refundable and a bit of a con  
N =>   Absolute crap The staff were ignorant we were not asked if we wanted smoking or non smoking when booking in the reception staff just couldnt give a damn  The bar stafff on hearing our english accents ignored us and served everyone else do they understand if they were polite they would recieve more tips          One good point when we were upgraded due to faulty plumbing the bellboy Austin was absolutly fantastic Would not recommend this accomodation to any english as we were ignored 
N =>   I am Cheap but I wish I wasn t This place is a cheap way to see Vegas but it is in a bad location and the kids are EVERYWHERE    Its not bad for the price I guess but we booked a King Bed and got   Double beds  We booked through Southwest Airlines so that might have had something to do with it  If I go back to Vegas I will try to stay at a cheaper place closer to the middle of the Strip like Treasure Island  The Mirage  or The Flamingo  New York New York was cool but it was really smoky  
N =>   cheap way to see Vegas We have just returned from Vegas after one weeks stay at Circus Circus  after reading the revues before I went I was starting to get a bit worried but overall the experience was fine  When we arrived at the hotel I requested a room in the West Tower which we were given without any problem  the room itself was very large compered to other hotels I have stayed in when holidaying in Europe  it had two double beds in it a small table couple of chairs and a flat screen t v  it was also clean The hotel was fairly quiet for the first few days  we arrived on a Wednesday  but at the weekend it was packed to the rafters as it was Labor Weekend Vegas is fabulous and will definitely be going there again  as for Circus Circus I have no complaints I got what I payed for  but next time I go I will stay at one of the more expensive hotels further down the strip though after checking prices it looks like it will cost double to what I payed this time  Circus Circus is ok but in need of a revamp but if you are taking children to Vegas this hotel would suit you fine  if you don t like kids give it a miss  If you are going to see a show in Vegas see KA at the MGM Grand it s fantastic  
N =>   Stolen Football Boots Myself  amp  my    year old son stayed at Circus Circus for   days  which co incided with my son s   th birthday  The night before his birthday we went to the Outlet Village by taxi to buy some new football boots as so much cheaper than UK  We got a great pair of Adidas predators and took them back to our room  Unfortunately  I kept the receipt in the bag with the box of boots and put them next to the table in our room  When we checked out we realised that I had not packed his boots  As soon as we got to our next hotel our rep rang Circus Circus and they checked our room  The only people who had access to our room other than us were their staff but they have refused to accept liability  If you are staying here make sure that all your luggage is kept secure   I didn t realise that we were expected to put such things as football boots in the safe     Left really sour taste as I know that the they have been stolen but no one will believe me  Unfortunately  as we were in such a rush to catch a bus to next destination I didn t realise immediately that the boots had vanished Other than that hotel is like others have reported  a big children s paradise  amp  casino  Food not great and the Manager in the Garden Grill was very rude after I had problems with debit card  Wouldn t recommend it  
N =>   My aching back    On our first trip to Las Vegas  we decided to go cheap and stay at CC  The overall atmosphere was like an amusement park  Kids running everywhere with parents nowhere to be found  probably gambling   Our room was subpar in the back part of the building facing the RV park  It was ok  but the beds were so uncomfortable  I could feel every spring in the mattress  They need to spend some dollars on upgrading the rooms  Would never stay here again  Spend the extra few dollars and stay elsewhere on the strip  
N =>  Never again After being unable to make our flight home  we needed a hotel for one night only and chose Circus Circus just because we stumbled across this one first while driving back towards the strip from the airport  and knew it would be relatively cheap As we queued to check in  the first thing we noticed were the tired carpets and cheap wall coverings  The staff were friendly and cannot really be faulted  We were sent across the casino floor to get to our room  and after staying in Planet Hollywood on the same holiday we could not believe how differerent the hotels could be  Almost everything about the casino was old and in need of urgent upgrade  The carpets were worn  paint faded and just overall old fashioned The lift we got in  didn t go to our floor for some reason  So we had to get out and wait for a different one  The next lift was rusted and had holes in the walls big enough to fit your hand through  The rooms were clean  but again old fashioned  worn and a tad smelly Entertainment within the hotel was limited at best  and eating establishments were not the greatest  except for Krispy Kreme   Overall  for the price difference between staying at Circus Circus and other hotels on around the Strip  we seriously recommend choosing another hotel  We dont think we could ve managed another night here and were glad it only had to be the one  
N =>  Take your business elsewhere  My partner  amp  I travelled to Las Vegas last month at the end of our vacation Having heard that Circus Circus was a great place to stay  amp  fairly central to other popular Las Vegas attractions  we booked a Manor Room On check in  despite having pre booked  amp  prepaid our accomodation  a receipt was presented to the counter assistant advising that the accomodation was prepaid  amp  I was not to be charged for the room The receipt also advised that a non smoking  Manor Room had been purchased The counter assistant  who was rather rude insisted that a single  smoking room had been booked for both of us to stay in  in which she asked for my credit card to charge the room The receipt was again  bought to her attention in which she huffed rudely  amp  advised that an inprint of my credit card would still be required so as    a day could be charged for the local calls for the phone in the room whether it was used or not When questioned as to why I would be charged for a service that I would not to be used  she said it was Circus Circus policy  amp  that the site where I booked the accomodation would ve advised me of this before I booked I have booked accomodation through this site plenty of times aswell as stayed at plenty of hotels  amp  never have any advised me that this is their policy Once she finally organised the room that I had paid for  a map of Circus Circus was shoved at me across the counter  amp  the lobby circled aswell as the block of the Manor Rooms we would be staying in Having quite a bit of luggage with us as this was the final stop of our trip  we had no assistance whatsoever moving it to our room  which was a good distance away from the block where our room was located Upon reaching the room  which was at the very back of the block the hotel was located on  the front door was stuck  the block smelt of cigarettes  amp  there was crumbling plaster in the hallway The room itself smelt of cigarettes  the carpets had not been cleaned for sometime as there was bits of dried food  amp  nail clippings aswell as dust in the corners The bathroom  although fresh towels were supplied daily  was very old  the wall paper was peeling above the shower  there were black marks on the floor of the shower where the non slip coating had worn away  amp  what looked like brown glue all over the top of the walls The toilet also had difficulty flushing  amp  the shower dripped loudly constantly Despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door  the housekeeper knocked loudly each morning before trying to access the room with her own key I realise this was nowhere near   star accomodation  I didnt expect it to be  however I did expect the room to at least be clean  amp  exceptional customer service as the hotel advertises I definitely wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone else  
N =>  It was a good deal but I wouldn t repeat  After visiting the rest of the hotels on the strip  I felt that it was lacking  be it was just not my style  
N =>  Good hotel Good hotel for good money  Clean  but air conditioners were obsolete and noisy    
N =>   Way better than I expected  To enter the hotel check in area  you must enter through the parking garage  Be careful of the speed bumps  they are tall  They have free Valet parking which was very nice because this place is so large  it would have been hard to find our car The check in process was long  especially since we had booked online and had already paid  There is a    a day charge for the phone The first room they gave us was still dirty at      P M  The safe was also locked  We called the desk and they gave us another room  Got to the new room and it was clean but the safe was also locked  To unlock the safe  there has to be an engineering man and a security guard  The guard showed up in just minutes but had to leave  He said to tell the engineering man that it was ok to unlock the safe without security being there  The engineering guy shows up and says he can t unlock it without security  He gets on the phone and finally gets the ok to unlock it  They need to have a better system for a speedier check in and for when safes are left locked  This all burned about an hour of our vacation time in Vegas The room was fantastic  It has a modern style with granite countertops and pillow top beds  There is a flat screen TV but there are hardly any watchable channels We did have trouble with having enough washcloths  What is it with motel housekeeping that they can t leave enough washcloths  We had   towels    washcloth and there was   of us  I did call and got some fairly quickly I wasn t sure what we were getting after reading the reviews  I was very surpised that the room was so modern and updated  Besides the time wasted on the safe issue  we had a great stay  My    year old won   stuffed animals at the midway with only        They need to do something about the staff on the midway  They are the most lifeless  unhappy looking people I saw on my      mile vacation  
N =>   Do not Go here DO NOT GO HERE     We were mean t to stay for    nights but moved out as soon as we could  We were told that the hotel was going to be demolished last year until the recession hit    no money spent on it  Wallpaper peeling off  TV cabinet doors ripped off and sharp edges showing cracked and leaking toilet  pool packed and you can t get a seat  long distance from the strip    paid a fortune in cab fares Dont come here    this is not an american hotel  
N =>   Great price We had heard and read mixed emotions on Circus  Circus    But we wanted something for our kids to do  and a good value  We got both   We booked online directly with the hotel back in the Spring for our e stay and wow         night  We booked adjoining rooms in the main tower  It was very nice  larger accomodations than most  very clean  nice bathrooms and comfortable beds  We were on the   th floor and it was very quiet The casino was nice and the kids loved the Adventure Dome    The buffet was the only disapointment  The food wasn t good at all  Would NOT recommend  very overpriced for the poor quality They do have other places to eat in there though and the food was tasty   The pool was a bit of a disapointment as well    over over crowded and didn t look the cleanist  I think they may be starting renovations on it Would not recommend this hotel if you don t have children   because they are everywhere and well   hence Circus  Circus   As it should be  
N =>   Excellent stay nice rooms On our las vegas trip mach       We stayed at this hotel  at first we were a bit shocked by the small and gruuby casino area  howevere as soonm as we checked in to our room we where happy  we had an excellent room and was very clean and the room was simply splendid  Huge bed and plenty of space  even better they had a krispy kreme donoughts in the casino itself  i was made up  The casino houses a huge car park and its easy to navigate around that  we did not have food in the casino steak house  even though its highly regarded as the best in vegas it also seemed way overpriced for what it was  overall an excellent stay and would recomend this to anyone  will deffo be staying there again  
N =>   DO NOT STAY oh my god it was not good at all  no coffee pot in room so i had to go to the bottom floor and buy coffee but guess what the machine was out of order all week i said something to a worker there she said they are not the hotel s she could care less  the safe was broken in the room  the commode was broken  air didn t work good  please check around before you book here  
N =>   It Sucks  Don t even consider this hotel I stayed in Circus Circus with my two kids    and   year old  and my uncle aunt on           I had booked two non smoking rooms in the west tower  One of my friend also booked a room for himself and his family    kids  on the same day  We requested to be put in the rooms close to each other  When we reached our rooms  we found that we were in the smoking section  The rooms were stinking of Cigarette smoke  When we approached the customer service person he was rude  After complaining  we were offered rooms on different floors in different sections of the hotel  They claim that every room has an ironing board and an iron  We had an iron in one room  No ironing board  Other room did not have the iron or the ironing board These people should not be in the hospitality business  
N =>   Viva Las Vegas   Circus Circus Well what can I say  Vegas is fantastic  This Hotel is showing it s age My husband and I stayed here y    to ust        Hotel pros  Cheap to stay at  large rooms  comfortable bed  quiet in room   unable to hear others   shower works well  location is at end of strip  which is a little quieter  beleive me this can be a good thing   Deuce bus stops out front  which you will use alot to get around  it runs        Unable to comment on pool  did not use   Housekeeping is either around  am or  pm  depending on if you have do not disturb sign out   Flat screem TV  Very Child friendly with circus shows  amp  indoor park with rollercoaster and games etc  Various food selections  from buffets  to Krispy Kreme  hotdogs  Subway  Pizza and just about anything you can imagine  McDonalds is next door Hotel Cons  Old  no tea coffee facilities in room  which I did know before booking   housekeeping forget what do not disturb means and called a couple of days in a row to see what time we want our room cleaned  we were asleep   Asked for a smoking room and got a non smoking room   went back down to reception who then said  that is not a problem and sent up ashtrays   we were on a non smoking floor   this did not seem to bother them      If you have children you would more than likely like this hotel  there is so much to entertain them On another note We did not know this before going to Vegas  Children are able to walk through all the Casino s as long as they don t loiter around gaming machines and tables  which is something you are not allowed to do in Australia  and was quite weird for us  There is so much to do in Vegas that is free for all ages  Would recommend this hotel to families  but we would stay somewhere else if we were to return to Vegas  
N =>  Easy with kids We had a fine stay at Circus Circus  It is not as  posh  as the other hotels on the strip  however it was very good value  an easy place to be with children  clean and the food was of a good standard  We chose to stay in the west tower rooms which are a bit more expensive but I think it was worth it as they were lovely  We did not go to the casino so I cannot comment on the gambling  However as a base to explore Las Vegas and take a trip to the Grand Canyon  we used Papillon and were very pleased   it was excellent  We alsowent to a show  Cirque de Soleil at Treasure Island  which I would recommend  
N =>   Rundown Dump The prices whch entice people there are not worth the money  The hotel is run down  dingy  noisy and poorly run  We had asked for a handicapped room due to my husband s physical condition We are seniors and were traveling with a teen grandson and a    year old grandaughter  who were equally unimpressed  Fortunately we had checked our luggage at the valet parking so we were not draggimg that as many people did  We had to walk the entire length of the lobby and around to an escalator to the promenade  then through that area into the casino and up on an elevator there to get to the room  I will commend the valet parking satff and the bell hops as they were prompt and efficient as well as helpful  The bell desk was another story  We returned in the evening to find the escalator to the Promenade  and our room  shut down and no explantion as to how we reached our thrid floor room  When we hiked back to the bell desk  after finally getting their attention  we were told the West elevators took us to the  nd floor and we could walk through he promenade AGAIN to get to the elevators to the room The area around the circus acts is hard to locate  and surrounded by arcade games which are rip offs  The seating is extremely limited around the circus stage  and each act has about    to    minutes between acts  When we took the elevator to the pool it creaked and the light blinked  giving us great concern we would get stuck on it  Needless to say we didn t swim  The Adventuredome is geared to young children and has some pretty steep prices considering what is there  Overall the hotel was not clean  worn  crowded and not worth the stay  Avoid this one     
N =>   Don t do it    Worst Experience Worst ExperienceHotel is falling apart  Obvious that either going bankrupt or they plan on tearing down soon  No investment being made in maintaining infrastructure  Staff was nice and pleasant but you can tell they are working with limited resources  Had hand and face towel only one day out of    Was told their supplier had not delievered  Only   of   elevators that serviced    floors worked and those two were a scary ride  Consequently long wait times of up to    minutes for an elevator  Had to find staff to open up access to freight elevators  which worked perfectly fine   Overall cleaniness of hotel room was good but carpet in rooms stained  windows dirty and that completely turned me off  Hotel buffet gross  Hotel smelled  No real place to sit and relax and have a drink  Long registration lines  Over     hour wait  Only one pool open and it was a scary adventure to get to that  Hotel full of vendors selling junk  Difficult to walk halls without someone trying to sell you something  Would have checked out first day if had not prepaid  Room service only open to noon  if you can get someone to answer phone   Trying to call for help  house keeping  front desk  etc   pointless  no one answers phone  Carnival games and circus acts outdated  retro    s   Amusement park overpriced compared to limited rides especially for young children  
N =>   GOD AWFUL Check in was smooth  and then you get to the room  What a dump  Hair was on the bathroom floor from previous guest  the only window was full of hand prints  No coffee maker  no room service except you could order pizza The Steak House was the only GREAT thing about this hotel  the food was outstanding  service and staff fantastic  Definetly worth a visit Pool was too crazy  went to other hotels to hang out  Golden Nugget and Freamont street were loads of fun Went to see the Hoover dam  bus driver Ron was great  loads of fun and informative Would not stay at this hotel EVER again  not only due to the rooms  but you have about a mile to walk up the strip before you get pass all the trash along the road  empty parking lots and buildings  not to mention the crazy people hanging around the side walks For the price  upgrade and stay further up by Treasure Island or over on Freamont Street  
N =>   Circus Circus FUN    We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel  At check in  the clerk was nice enough to upgrade our room from the main tower room to the west tower room for free     Our room was very nice  The housekeeping staff was very generous as well  The kids loved the fact that the Adventuredome was right in the hotel and there was a McDonalds inside as well  My husband and I were able to enjoy the fitness center that was equipped with just enough equipment for our workout  There was plenty of stuff to do for everyone  There were lots of restaurants in the hotel  The buffet was ok for the price  I was really diappointed that the hotel did not have free wireless internet  The fee was        per night or you could use the kiosk in the lobby for    cents per minute unless you are printing you boarding passes  Then it is a little more  
N =>   Un Helpfull and un caring staff    I stay at Circus Circus in Las Vegas on every trip  This time I had a fall in a badly lit under ground car park  I was found knocked out and bleeding  The security staff took me inside and took pictures etc  They asked me to go to hospital I did not want to go as I was on holiday from the UK and had little insurance  they told me they would help with the cost  weeks later and       bill for stiches the hotel told me they would not help towards the cost     They where un friendly and un helpfull  To add more drama the room was dirty with hair in the bath and toilet     
N =>   a noisy place to stay   I was on a round trip in Usa   And want to selbrate my    year birthday   I only have to stay for   night   I was a verry noisy   not a place to stay for adolt people   With kids i maby verry good    We went other places to eat an have fun 
N =>   You Get What You Pay For If you want a very cheap stay Circus Circus is a great place  The decor is outdated but it didn t bother us  Our stay started off terrible  we had booked a non smoking room and even through we were told our room was non smoking there was a horrible smoke smell from the rug and in the drapes in our room  The pool was a huge dissappointment it was the size of our hotel room and the photo s on their site are very decieveing  The amount of children that were running around was insane  we expected it but not to that extent  The service was subpar throughout the whole stay  nothing that really made us go wow  On the flip side the casino treated my girlfriend and I really well  The payouts were good  we won the most in this casino than anywhere else   the low minimum buy ins were good too since I am not a huge gambler I would not stay here again unless I was taking my whole family  which I wont be for a while  
N =>   Disappointing I was so utterly disappointed and disgusted with this hotel  I will never ever stay there again We   myself  my husband and I  arrived on a Monday  got our keys and checked in  We went into the room  My daughter was wearing white socks and within    minutes  her socks were black  It was gross  There were used cups under the sink in the bathroom  a ring around the tub  dirty sheets  I immediately asked for a transfer  which we were granted  This one was at least clean  Our next problem was the people next door  The rooms on both sides have adjoining doors as a convenience for party s of more than one family or families sharing rooms  They were smoking on both sides    it was a non smoking floor  My daughter had been coughing and we couldn t figure out why  until we smelled the cigarettes  When I called to the front desk  I was asked to hold  then when I explained that the people on both sides were smoking  She said they had  quot no control over what people did in their rooms quot  I confirmed that it was a non smoking floor she said yes I asked what they were going to do about it  They wanted to move US gt  inconvenience the ones that are following the rules  Her exact words were  quot  mam  I apologize  We can switch rooms if you like or you can just put a towel under the door and we will have room service come and spray the room so you don t smell it  quot  OOOOOH I was mad  If only I had known that it was illegal  I would have called the police and not the front desk  She completely missed the point  I was calling because my daughter was suffering and coughing and wheezing  They had no regard for our health and stay  We ended our stay with Circus Circus on Friday  but ended up needing to stay in Las Vegas another night due to my husband being ill  We ended up booking at Treasure Island  Now that is a hotel  It was soo much nicer  cleaner and much better service Now I know why it was so inexpensive to stay there and why they have a coupon book full of discounts  They suck  
N =>  Good stay It was a nice stay for a good price at LAs vegas The rooms were not the best but good enough to spend the night  The casino attached to the hotel helped especially since they had a variety of kids activities 
N =>  The service in this hotel is awful except a few bellhops and the chapel My fiance  me  my adult niece  and my   kids stayed here for   days  I called twice to make sure they had all our info and requests and when we got there they had nothing  So it took forever and then we ended up not getting anything we asked for  Every person we talked to except   of   bell hops and the chapel employees were rude and seemed to not care  We paid an arm and a leg to check out late and when we got to our room at noon the maid had taken our crib out and moved all our stuff because no one told her we were staying  Every price they quoted me for things was wrong  like for the extended check out  And the walk to our room was ridiculous  We had to take   elevators and walk in   circles around the place  Then the rooms were outdated and things were broken  The circus shows were great  but you can come see them wherever you stay at  Definitely not the highlight of the trip  And they are way far north so it take awhile to get to the bigger attractions  
N => great comfort we went with family to vegas and got a great deal to stay in this hotel we got manor rooms still they are like deluxe rooms great hotel for the price  
N =>  What an experience This was my first trip to vegas  amp  the sheer size of the hotel amazed me  The check in countres was so huge  there were people waiting  I had seen nothing like that before  The walk to the room was good   minutes but i liked all of it  Although not great like other hotels on the strip   I haven t stayed but they looked better from outside   amp  also slightly away from the strip  I will call the whole experience as average  I will try other hotels if i travel again to vegas    
N => will never stay there again        I was making a trip through LV on my way to and from my grand daughters graduation  else where in NV  and since my grandson would be with me thought Circus Circus would be a nice place to stay on Thurs  night and on the way back on Sunday night  Being on a very limited budget I was thrilled to find out we could get a room for less than     a night   THE THRILL STOPPED THERE                        DO NOT try to purchase your room online unless you plan on completing the transaction  I reached the section that said  quot by going to the next section you are authorizing charges to your card quot   Since the nights I needed the room were not consecutive nights I decided to just call reservations  I DID NOT CONTINUE to the next link  I called reservations Wed night at     pm from the Phoenix  Az area and made my reservations for thurs and sun  The next morning  I checked my bank account to be sure of the money I had left to travel on  and realized I had   charges pending instead of    It seems that although I did not complete the online reservation charges were pending on my account and would not transfer back for up to   buisness days  My sunday reservation was ok but they had me as a NO SHOW on my thursday because the dummy that made my reservation did it for Weds     I was a no show before I left  Again  my funds for that transaction would be reversed but not for up to   buisness days  My already stretched budget was missing over         We asked about getting a movie and were told there was a     deposit  but the card would not be used unless we actually got one and then just the amount for the movie  At check out we found out they did charge the card and low and behold ANOTHER up to   business days     The rooms we stayed in were not the worst I have ever stayed in but the carpet was FILTHY  On Sunday the main entry door of the manor we stayed in was taped so it would not latch  great security       The buffet was terrible  The rides at adventure dome were PAINFUL   The worst part was the fact that due to the pending charges my bank account was overdrawn when I got home    My bank is a whole other review   Long story longer      I lost my A   in Vegas and I didn t even gamble   
N =>  Ok place  The room was basic  comfortable bed  no fridge  The housekeeping was great  Tons of kids running around unsupervised  Terrible service at the pizza place  Pretty far from the main part of the strip  but walkable  I probably wouldn t stay there again  I would spend the extra bills to go to a classier place  
N =>   Just pay a little more for better hotel or much less for off strip clean hotel  Strong stench in the  quot Manor quot  room  Staff couldn t care less about the problem  Was forced to upgrade to  quot deluxe quot  room with less stench and old dirty sheets  Bad rooms  worst staffs  Stay away  
N =>   Clean comfortable beds lots to do       black jack only one on strip  We found alot of values in hotel itself  Nice pools  have to walk aways to them on third floor  big casino  constantly going wrong way to and from strip Best prime rib all you can eat for           price margaretta pitchers Free circus actsWent with a friend and we had a blast  We had no intention of spending alot of time in our room when we decided to go to Vegas  We would stay again  It looks like they are building a new casino next to to replace this one Unlike alot of the casinos we reviewed  ther was not a daily charge to use the pool  
N =>   Pleasantly surprised after all the bad reviews My husband and I decided at the last minute to spend some time in Las Vegas whilst visiting Miami and it was the best travel decision we ve made in a while We opted to stay at Circus Circus to save money despite the many bad reviews that were written We were able to call ahead for Express check in which saved us having to stand in the long lines Our room was on the  th floor  NON SMOKING  and we were escorted to the appropriate elevator  all elevators are not created equal LOL We stayed in the West Tower which was one of the newly renovated rooms and we were more than happy with what we got   Queen BedsIron  amp  Ironing BoardHair DryerCable TV flat screenIf for some reason we were forced to stay in our rooms for the duration of the trip we would have been okay We had a problem with the safe and maintenance arrived before we could put the phone down from making the request The hotel itself i okay it was pretty busy most of the time Dinner at the steakhouse was excellent The main casino was pretty smoky so we opted to gamble  the little we did  at Caesar s Palace We used the Deuce transit system so our location was never a problem Our return trip is booked for ober  
N =>   Huge but okay  Huge hotel  but room in skytower was OK  Tip  first park yr car  then it s a short trip by elevator to the check in  Check in was not busy at all  You ll get a coupon for Adventuredome    for     when checkin  in  Swimmingpool closes at  pm  
N =>   Good value but wouldn t pay full price OK  so we never should have gone to Vegas  I hated the casino atmosphere  having to walk past gaming machines and cigarette smoke to either enter or exit the hotel  The room was OK  service was very impersonal due to the size of the place but it was CHEAP The room was a LOOOONNG walk from the street main entrance  it literally took       minutes   The guest laundry was in the RV park  add another   mins walk   Good value but I d neither stay in Vegas nor in this hotel again  
N =>  great family place This was our first trip to vegas This place was perfect has lots of games for the kids the adventure dome was great for kis and adults Our room was good size with connecting door to the kids good comfortable queen beds Great place to stay and cheap  
N => ent place Stay was okay  The black jack games at the casino are    minimum    
N =>   Would never stay at this place   I was planning to stay the weekend at this place after a couple of business meetings in Las Vegas  The price was right and it seemed like it was in a good location  The location was not terrible  north end of the strip   but you really get what you pay for   The room they gave me was not even in the hotel casino  Be aware that if your room says  quot Manor Room quot   that means you are out in the parking lot  You have to walk about    minutes from the lobby out to the sketchy parking lot to these rows of   story buildings that look like run down Motel   s from a horror movie  I am a    year old guy who thought it was sketchy making that walk  so think about that if you plan to bring your g f or family   After seeing the terrible location of the room and the extremely shabby appearance of the room  I trudged back to the front desk to ask for a different location   I was even willing to pay more money  The clerks at the front desk said they had no rooms available and that I would have to call in the morning to see if there were any cancellations  They would not put me on a wait list and upgrade me if something came up  They said if I called in the morning and there were no openings  I would have to keep calling until there was a cancellation   they had no wait list whatsoever  After discussing what options I had with the front desk  for about    minutes   which essentially were none  I decided to cancel my reservation  They said they would have to charge for the first night  so I might as well stay  I was so frustrated with them at that point  that I let them charge my card and went and stayed somewhere else  Overall I was very disappointed with their service  their rooms in the  quot Manor quot  and my overall experience  I will never even consider staying at this hotel again  
N =>   Good price location leaves much to be desired I liked the excellent price we recieved on our hotel  We were even upgraded because when we arrived   the hotel didn t have the room they had reserved for us  Check in took about    minutes because of a huge line  The room was very nice  The hotel itself was extremely busy  Crowded all the time  Casino was okay  but  quot slots of fun quot  right next door was better  and paid better   It is a designated stop for The Duece Bus  and that was a good thing  The nearest monorail hub is     a mile down the road  The one major problem that got to me is that the hotel allows timeshare people to come into the hotel and HARASS the guests about coming to view a timeshare  When I say harassment  it was just that  They would follow you and yell at you if you told them no  That was a big change for us  because during our previous stays  at other hotels on the strip  this was not allowed  It is for that reason and the location on the very end of the strip that we will not stay at Circus Circus again  The constant having to duck the time share people was unbearable  Also  we prefer to stay mid strip  There was homeless people outside our hotel at Circus Circus  and we just did not feel entirely safe when walking to other casinos at night  Additionally  even tho the rooms got a recent makeover   parts of the hotel seemed a little run down  
N =>   BUSY   Family Atmosphere This was not our first stay at the Circus Circus  We stayed in one of the advertised recently renovated West Tower non smoking   queen sized beds rooms  Even though the furnishings and decor indicated it was recently renovated from our previous visit  the room was beginning to age due to the large number of guests that stay at this hotel  However  our room was clean as was the bathroom although the windows needed a cleaning badly Spent quite a few hours at the pool   it was very busy as it was Spring break   finding a lounge was a task at times depending on what time you were visiting the pool and the weather of the day We encountered a few problems during our stay  no advertised fun books were provided to our family upon checkin as we were advised we would receive when making our reservations  no towels in our room upon our checkin into our room the very first day and despite leaving our room at approximately      a m  our room was not made up until later that afternoon after      p m We advised the housekeeping bell and front desk staff as well as guest services of the problems that our family encountered during our stay  And we were pleasantly surprised that the hotel took the time to understand our concerns and rectified the problem s  Should we return to Las Vegas in the future  we will definitely consider staying at the Circus Circus once again  
N =>   Good room for a cheap price Circus Circus was a good place to lay your head at night  However  the food and casino were lacking  We basically stayed away from the hotel all day until we needed to sleep  The room was nice and larger than expected  The room was clean and always had plenty of towels  shampoo  and soap  Circus Circus was great for what we needed  Simply a room to crash in at the end of a long funfilled day  
N =>   OK Value for the money My husband  three children  mother  amp  I stayed from ch   th to il  st  We booked two rooms  amp  stayed in the Skyway     Tower  My mothers room was decorated ok  however  ours was missing a picture  the alarm clock had to be unplugged due to incessant buzzing   was definately worse for wear  Staff was wonderful   prompt maintenance service when Mom s toilet broke  Met up with friends who stayed in the Manor rooms  They had a fridge  amp  I liked the decor in those rooms better  however  I noticed a towel that sat in the entry way for   days   amp  a vacuum cleaner was left outside my friends  door overnight  Would not recommend the Midway as the games kept eating quarters   amp  I could not find an agent to refund lost money  Also saw childless adults hanging around   creepy  
N =>   Horrible  What a tired old dump  Dark  dirty  over crowded  We did not stay here  thank goodness  but took our kids to see the circus   ok  it was a good way to kill an hour but OMG  I was scared just to walk through the place  There is new construction all around the place   maybe the owners of this dump should take a clue they are about to loose business to the new places  bulldoze the place and start over  STAY FAR AWAY  
N =>  An Absolute Dump   My wife and I just got back from our stay at Circus Circus and I can tell you without a doubt that it is the absolute worst  We thought we d save some money and decided that Circus Circus really couldn t be that bad  but we were very  very wrong  The first impression you get when you walk into the lobby to check in is that maybe you ve made a mistake  We got checked in fairly late    pm  and decided to take our bags to the room and explore the casino  When we got to our room we found the toilet was broke and did not flush properly  the faucet in the sink could not be turned off it had a constant flow of water coming out of it and there was still trash in the trashcan in the room  Instead of initially giving us another room they sent a maintenance guy up and he proceeded to tear the toilet apart trying to fix it  I m not kidding  he had toilet parts all over the bathroom floor  a complete and utter mess  Come to find out the toilet would have to be replaced  We had to call down to the front desk and request another room and an hour later we actually got one  After we got settled into the  nd room we went down to the casino  We walked around all of    or    minutes which was all it took  My wife was nervous due to all the seedy gangster like characters that were walking around the casino  we felt completely out of place so we returned back to the room  Needless to say as soon as we got up in the mornin we went down and got a taxi and got the hell out of there and didn t return until late in the evening  As much as I hate to say it  it was the absolute worst stay I have ever had in Vegas and I would steer anyone away from going to Circus Circus  
N =>   awesome one of my favorite hotels i felt like i was in paradise while i was staying at that hotel i mean i loved the room the service and everything it was so cool i can t wait to stay there again    
N =>   Wouldn t go back We were in Manor building C       Walls paper thin  could hear people in room next to us when they were talking in a normal voice  small children running  amp  yelling in hall way after      pm until     am  Asked to be next to brother  amp  sister in law  amp  was put at the opposite ends of the hall  also made reservation for a KING bed  amp  got   QUEEN beds instead MK Bakersfield  Ca 
N =>   Couldn t have asked for it to be any better After booking our trip we read bad review after bad review  I m not sure what these people are expecting but I thought EVERYTHING was great  Housekeeping was awesome  We went to the buffet a few times and all thought it was well worth it  My husband loved the sports book  The pool was great  Our room was very clean and spacious  We had a family of five in one room for   days and it was just fine  Don t take these bad reviews to seriously because these people must be use to a   star or are just really uptight  I ve stayed in plenty of hotels and no Circus Circus isn t top of the line but it is far from a dump  It s an average place that s great for family s or single people just stay off the  rd floor if you don t like kids  
N =>   I love this place First off    I see a lot of complaints about long check in times  Circus Circus has created a solution to this  you just need to be informed  Circus Circus has created an express check in service  All you have to do is call a number  give them your room preferences and they will put you on the express check in list  I had my wife call and check in while we were driving up to Las Vegas  Upon arrival  we found a check in line with about       people  We then found a line with   people  marked  quot Express Check In quot   We saved ourselves at least an hour and were headed to our room within   minutes  Believe me  though  we got lots of angry glares from the uninformed travelers who had been waiting in line much longer than us Our room was on the   rd floor we requested to be as high up as possible  and in the corner of the hotel  It was very secluded and quiet  We opted to pay    bucks a night extra for an updated room in the West tower  It was very clean though I will admit I found a hair on two of the three pillows  and comparable to rooms at higher level hotels  Do yourself an enormous favor and pay the extra    bucks a night for the updated rooms  If not  at least request to be in a tower  The manor rooms cost as much as the tower that isn t updated  but they will put you in either if you don t specify After getting settled we decided to get some dinner  The  quot Casino Cafe quot  that we enjoyed on our last visit now has limited hours and was closed so we tried  quot Mexitalia X Press quot   We didn t expect much from it but the Mexican pizza I ordered ended up being pretty good  Prices are about the same as a typical chain restaurant  i e  Applebees  Chili s  etc  and portions are pretty big  I brought half my pizza back to the room We relaxed in the room awhile and watched TV on the flat panel before heading down to the casino  We decided to go to  quot Slots A  Fun quot   which is a casino located on the Circus Circus property that is home to primarily vintage slot machines that still accept pennies  nickels  quarters  etc in lieu of credit  The casino also features    oz draft beers and margaritas for        though my wife said the margaritas had very little alcohol in them  I wanted to try one of their gigantic       hot dogs from the snack bar but it was cash only  The casino also has a Subway but we were a little turned off to find their prices were literally twice as much as a typical Subway all of their footlongs were at least       We went back to Circus Circus and ate a cheap meal at Mcdonalds  which is located on the Midway level CONS  The parking garage is ancient and kind of a pain in the neck if the place is crowded  It s also pretty filthy    when we arrived we found a soda bottle filled with urine sitting in front of a parking spot near us  When we left the next day it was still there Also  we were told at check in that we would have a view of the strip  Instead  we had a view of the Adventure Dome and the manor rooms All and all it was a very good stay and we will certainly be back    
N =>   Will never stay here again Hotel posted a fraudulent charge to our credit card  and only offered a free buffett to make up for the criminal action  Housekeeping staff could not speakl any english  Huge stain on our  quot remodeled quot room carpet  Front desk staff was very unhelpful and rude  Slots did not pay out well once the guests for Nascar staring arriving  Our entir experience at the hotel was horrible  Will never stay there again  even if they offered us a free stay  
N =>   Will not return  Circus Circus Circus  Our family just returned from a weeklong Spring Break trip to the Southwest  I found and booked a night at Circus Circus for a reasonable rate  A rare place not charging       per kid extra  My expectations were not too high  but didn t expect the surprise we encountered  We arrived early afternoon  ided to delay check in after we saw the lenght of line at front desk  St  Patty s day so place was sold out  We headed down the strip for a day and evening of fun  Got back around midnight  exhausted  to check in  Line wasn t muchshorter and they only had three agents working  part time  Took an hour  got our key headed to room  key didn t work  Went back to lobby  got two more keys  they didn t work Went back to lobby  kidnapped a nice bell desk guy  He came up to room  and his keydidn t work  either  He said he d have to have Security open the room in case someoneelse was in the room  It is now past       Security shows up  also very nice guy  opensthe room  peeks inside  says all clear  My son goes in first  not all clear  Someonewas sleeping in one of the beds  Security stayed with us  called downstairs  got put on hold  twice  moved us to another room  vacant   It was now after      am Got a few hours sleep  nice room  and went downstairs to tell my story to manangement While the desk supervisor was empathic  didn t offer anything  until I asked him for a reccomendation for breakfast  Gave me a couple of   for   buffet tickets  Other than the Bell guy and the Security guy  the other staff seemed indifferent  overworked or annoyed  We stayed at Sam s Town last year and would definitely stay there instead of CircusCircus  even though way off strip  
N =>   It really is a Circus If you are a    year old guy with a group of friends ok  but otherwise this is probably not for you  At   pm it took us   hours to check in and get the correct room  we sat in the hallway for    mins waiting to get in to a king room  because the first room was a full bed  We called the front and they said they would send someone up to unlock a different room and that person never showed up  we ended up walking a mile back to the desk   After our   hour fiasco  all we wanted was to eat and go to bed  we had dinner reservations at a Anthony and Vics in the Golden Nugget  but had to cancel them   Anthony and Vics was amazing    When we got there a few nights later   There was only the cafe open  it smelled bad and there were only   servers on and the place was packed  We should have gotten some chips from the market and went to bed  Needless to say we checked out the next morning and moved to the Las Vegas Hilton   the remodeled rooms are very nice  I guess besides the POOR service  weird smell  HARD beds  Crazy weird hallway from the front desk to the rooms  seriously freaky  think scary clowns  loud screaming  and dark    once we got to our rooms it was unusually quiet  be that was because everyone was staying at other hotels and kept their rooms at Circus Circus to get their free theatre tickets  we never did check out because we needed our room key to get the free Circ tickets for Mystere at Treasure Island Think Motel   on Meth   With    million children running around  or I know it is Vegas  but it s  am  Put your kids to BED     
N =>   Circus Circus is the worst This by far is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  a group of us came to bowl in a tournament at the Cashman center  I originally made reservations at the Flamingo  then I found out that the rest of the group was staying at Circus Circus  so I changed it in order to stay with the group  that was my first mistake  our room in the west tower had to be in the dingiest part of the hotel  after we unpacked we went to the buffet  terrible food  our table looked like it hasn t been cleaned all day  we never went back there again  One morning we came down the elevator  it malfunctioned  the floor was not even with the doors  I tripped walking out  wrenched my knee some  I spent the rest of the day limping around vegas  It took them virtually all day before they shut it down then there was only   or   that were working so it took forever to get on one  and the minute you got out you were ambushed by people trying to sell you a timeshare or some other bull crap they were everywhere in the hotel  I was ready to hang a sign around my neck saying no thank you as I was getting tired of saying it every   minutes   The staff was anything but helpful  in one case they were down right rude to my husband and I  we needed to talk to one of the top manager and not   person was helpful  when we finally found one he already left for the day  Our stay there was a nightmare and I would never recommend it to anyone  pay the extra money for a better hotel or better yet  go down to the Freemont  
N =>   worst palce we have ever stayed We stayed here for nights in  and it was a nightmare fro beginning to end As soon as we arrived we got and uneasy feel with lots of undesirables hanging about  check in is dark and slow  our first room was about    mins from reception if you got a lift straight away and this was very unlikely  We discovered that we had no running hot water therefore unable to use shower  After waiting ages to get through to front desk on the phone we got moved to a different room on the   th floor  Saftey deposit box didnt work in this room  after    mins trying to report this we were told someone would be right up after a further    mins   another phone call we were told the it would take an hour for someone to come up We ended up late for our show in the Mirage and had to take all our valuables with us our room had   beds and the first bed we went to get into had soiled linen  In the morning we had to wait    mins for a lift  We were told that thios is a regular occurance as the lifts are always breaking down  The Casino smelt of a mixture of body odour vomit and smoke  Generally the hotel was run down and nobody cared We felt generally uneasy and vunerable in this place It is at the far end of the strip and you have to walk through an area where you feel like you are about to be mugged to get to the main strip  We would not recommend this hotel at any cost  
N =>   Really really bad    This was our second stay with Circus Circus   despite remembering not a great stay the time before  we thought this would be more kid friendly for our two young kids  as we were passing through  We were supposed to be in town for only a day  but our car had trouble  so we ended up staying longer than the one night we expected  We had so much stuff between the four of us  and with our car in the shop in a strange city  I thought moving to a better hotel would be more of a hassle than just toughing it out  VERY BAD   our non smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke  and the shower curtain in one of the bathrooms was so heavily laden with smoke we had to remove it   when we did  we noticed heavy black mold under the shower curtain rings   the ceiling to the bathrooms had mold collecting and the showers were also full of black mold  The fan in the bathroom was broken  When we thought we d only be there one night  I thought it was something I could live with  but   The beds were worse than pull out beds  with metal springs that poked through and hurt my knees and body   just awful  I had to layer blankets I brought from home on the beds  just to not hurt myself on the springs  There was the smell of vomit in the hallways  and the walls were so thin  we had to turn up our TV to drown out the people next door   when we turned up our TV to drown out the adjacent room and hallway sounds  security knocked on our door to tell us to turn down our TV  When we ordered pay movies  they would play for about ten minutes  and then the screen turned blue  and that was that  When I called the front desk to report it  we were told to turn the TV off and then try again  When the same thing happened  we ended up double charged for the movies  We were offered a credit for the movies over the phone  but the credit was not reflected on our bill  When I complained about that  the front desk insisted that engineering come to our room to verify the problem before giving credit  and I told them the night they said this to me that it was already too late at night and I was putting my family to bed   engineering came over anyway at almost midnight  When I complained that we didn t receive credit back for the movies that went blank  despite engineering at our door  I was asked who told me I would get a credit  and when I couldn t remember the name  was essentially accused of lying  and treated pretty badly  We had two adjoining rooms  and the hotel applies a     deposit to each room for incidentals  When we returned to our room at night after dinner  security was there and locked us out of one room  but not the other  saying we didn t have anymore credit left on one of the rooms because of the movies that were ordered and calls made  and we had to go to the lobby at    PM at night to put down another deposit  even thought the other room still had the full portion of unused credit  and we were never credited back for the movies that didn t work  When I said we never made calls  I was told they charged a mandatory fee per day for local calls  whether you make calls or not  The next morning  we spent over an hour being passed around to different people  trying to get the movie charges reversed and the problems rectified  and someone eventually  reluctantly gave in The refrigerator froze our food  The internet is     for    minutes  and in a hole  in  the wall room  with a really rude attendant  I went to use the internet there to try and find another place to stay  and a rental car  but after my    minutes were over  again thought the hassle of moving would do more harm than good  thinking we would only be there one more night and could get through it  When we needed to rent a car  the Dollar Car Rental at the hotel said they had one car left  which was tiny and with crank down windows  for which they charged us almost      per day  and told us there would be both an early return fee if we brought it back early as well as their late return fee  They said if there was any accident that we not only would be responsible for the repairs  but would also have to keep renting the car everyday until it was fixed  Luckily  I only keep that car one day with no accident  and then after using the internet for another        minutes  found another car from Enterprise   a real car   for     per day with no early return fee  When we found we had to stay longer until our car was repaired  the front desk wanted to jack up the price to almost double what we had originally paid   when I went to the supervisor  Manish  he was very nice and agreed to renew our stay at the originally quoted price   he was the only person at the hotel who seemed to care and was really nice   everyone else treated us like criminals  We ate at the buffet once   over     for lunch for a family of     while some of the desserts were pretty good and the salad bar was fresh  most of the main dishes were really bad  and I spit out several things into my napkin because they were that awful  They did have a really nice area for the KOA campground folks next to the hotel  which I found while looking to do some laundry  The KOA campground facilities were better than the facilities for regular hotel guests    Although I never camped before  I was wishing I was there instead of the actual hotel  Even though the KOA facilities were nice  the laundry room left some of my clothes in worse condition than before I washed them  and I ended up rewashing by hand some of our clothes back at the room  While I am sure the room would be passable for a one night  no expectations stay  there were just too many issues and problems for me to ever recommend the hotel to others  or ever plan on returning again  
N =>   Out of my     trips to vegas this was the bottom of the barrel  Held annual franchise convention with     guests    check in was bad  it averaged    mins per couple  Service was the pitts  BAD food at the garden grill and BAD servers    I had to get up to ask for drinks   times   after waiting    minutes from my inital request    food took an hour and half  managment handed out excuses  Place smelled bad  West tower room was much better than the rest of the rooms    some couples had to move room  x from bad rooms  not working  plumbing back up Etc    Staff was not helpful     ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS PLACE IS THE STEAK HOUSE  
N =>  Great for the price Check in can take some time  Booked a king room but the lady said right by the lift and really noisy so we took a queen room  Room average size  big bathroom  BEWARE lots of kids  The buffet is great here   Don t get the rib steak buffet at the other restaurant  Its not what it seems  Fun place but was quite a walk from anywhere  Definately invest in a all day bus ticket     Other hotels looked a lot better and nicer but was happy with what we had  Probably stay somewhere nicer next time though  We were on a really tight budget but found plenty of things to do  Don t buy any night club tickets  some of the night clubs had them out for free eg Cyote ugly  the bank  Get there early if you want to go to any of the clubs  big lines  Fire alarm went off twice but lucky we were just walking out the front door to dinner each time  
N =>  Have Fun At The Circus  So we wanted to stay at a hotel that was a fairly decent price and we thought it would be fun to stay at Cirus Circus not really thinking we are   adults staying at a place where there are lots and lots and lots of children  As much as I love kids it would have been nice to stay somewhere that was more for adults  but we didnt really think about that now did we      LOL  Otherwise the hotel was great  the adventure done is actually pretty cool but can get expensive  It is also way better to buy things on the little shops on the strip or go to the outlet stores and not buy things at your hotel since it is quite expensive but if money isnt an object then go hard and have fun  Make sure to make a trip to Fremont Street    so amazing  The  Duece  is ok to ride on just stay more towards the front or the upper level DEFINATELY carry some hand sanatizer when your walking the strip you never know who has thouched the hand rails or other things and there isnt always somewhere to wash your hands  If someone asks you if you want  free show tickets  just give them a thumbs up unless you want to be heckled into a   hour presentation for a time share      they ask anyone and everyone on the strip and at almost every hotel  We thought we were getting a deal and all this stuff but they didnt actually tell us it was for a time share and they had us pay them     to save a us a seat and we would get our money back and we did and wwe also did get our free tickets for shows but it was NOT worth it Otherwise Vegas is a BLAST  
N =>   Loved it  My husband and I stayed here as our last destination on our honeymoon  We had a pretty good time  The hotel was pretty big  We ate at their steak house  the food was good but our waiter was rather rude  All other staff we encountered here were very friendly  Our room had   queens but that was alright  It had semi easy access to the Duce  the bus line   When I lost my purse in a cab   one of their staff members was VERY helpful in helping me find a way to track them down  I would definitely stay here again  
N =>  Sooo bad   it made me wanna cirCUSS My husband and I booked a two night stay at Circus Circus  thinking it would look like what we had seen online and on tv commercials  I have to say that I have never  in my life  been to such a disgusting facility  The carpet was filthy  the room smelled like smoke and the tables and bed looked as if they had been chewed up  probably by one of the circus animals   Not to mention the fact that we had to walk outside of the main hotel  across the street  over the river and through the woods  to even get to our room  When my husband  calmly called and spoke to one of the front desk workers  he was told that there was nothing they could do about the room except have someone come and spray it  I was livid    I asked them how they could so easily take money from people and put them in these types of rooms  Even if they had given me the room for free  this room would still be totally unacceptable  We contacted the online service through which we booked the room and had them call the front desk  The  quot hotel quot   if that s what you want to call it  moved us to another room in a different building  still not in the main hotel  mind you  which was even worse than the first one  Once we were told we would receive our money back  we decided the best thing to do would be to book another room somewhere else We found a great room at an even greater price at the Riviera Hotel right across the street  The room was big  clean  the service was great and we didn t even have to spray air freshener    
N =>   Not worth the money  I was really disappointed  totally rundown place which had its best time approxemitally    years ago  Ok  it was relatively cheap  but the next time I would spend some more money to stay in a better place  It s to far away from major casinos  you have either to walk      min   or take the car everytime you want to see some fun places  The casion is absolutely not comparable with modern casinos  haven t eaten there but would not do it after I saw the restaurants  
N =>  Circus Circus a dump with a big top Late last year I went to the USA  amp  was told to stay while in Vegas at Circus Circus as it was good for kids The rooms were not what we saw in the brochure with ripped stains bed sheet  amp  carpet  It was a real hole  amp  ruined that part of our trip 
N => You get what you pay for We were getting into Vegas late night  so we basically needed a place to sleep  For     night  the Circus Circus provided us a place to sleep  Since we paid hardly anything  I think they gave us one of the older rooms  The room was basically motel quality and quite outdated  There was no iron and the blow dryer didn t work  The bathroom paint was chipping  But for the price  I can t complain  
N => worst hotel we have ever been to Avoid this place at all costs      We are a family of   and we stayed here for   days at the end of   The service      what service  Asked for extra pillow and after   calls and   hours later we got it  Next day we waited    mins to get an elevator from the   th floor to the lobby  We gave up and had to go down the stairs as we had people waiting for us in a cab  That same day after being out for    hours came back to the room not being made up and no new towels  Not once in all the days we stayed there did we get the   towels we needed any day we stayed  We seemed to spend every night ringing up for towels that took hours to get there  Talked to the shift manger and he didnt seem to even think we had a problem  We will never be going back  All the reno and the money spent doesnt help if the service is horrible  A few people we spoke to at the hotel also had horrible experiences If you do stay there at least you have been warned  
N =>  Worst Experience of my life We just returned from our very first trip to Las Vegas and we stayed at the Circus Circus  I can honestly say this was the worse motel I have ever been in  At check in it took   hours to get our room and then they demoted us to a smoking room and when we got to our room there was someone in the room  After standing in line another   hours they gave us a small room and then made us move the next day  The food was horrible and the atmosphere was ridiculous  The location is far from anything  This is by far the worse motel I have ever seen  Highly recommend NOT GOING  
N =>   Circus Circus   there s a circus inside  I don t really have anything extraordinary to say about circus circus other than  there s a circus inside   The room was clean and averaged sized  I woke up one morning to a family in the next room screaming at each other to get their stuff packed   and anytime a door slammed in the hallway I thought the art work was going to fall off the wall on my head The decor was outdated and the giant clown out front looked like he d been disected in a cruel game of  Operation  as you could see the inside workings of what should have been a giant light up sign Good location to get to the rest of the middle of the strip on foot and located near some places to get cheap eats  Overall probably a better place for families until they tear the place down  
N =>  Not Bad For the Money My wife and I stayed at Circus Circus for   nights as I was in Las Vegas for business  This was our first trip to Vegas so we really didn t know any better regarding where to stay  I booked it mostly because it was a good price and was close to the convention center  The theme is very dated and the hotel shows it is behind the times  Although there were not many children around it does seem to cater to family  so if you go during the peak season expect kids running around  Overall the hotel room was very clean and staff was very nice  After talking with the person at check in and explaining this was our first time we were given a complimentary upgrade  It sounded good at the time but who knows if it really was an upgrade  My only complaint was the elevators often were out of order  On a little more disturbing note we did witness some  negotiations  for some  personal services   At first it seemed   middle aged men were giving   women a hard time  It was hard not to notice as the men were very persistent and would not leave the women alone  It then hit us as to what was going on as they all got up and left the area  So perhaps the slow economy at the hotel allowed a little relaxed security on personal services  
N =>  Expensive Youth Hostel My fiance and two of my family members stayed three days over thanksgiving at the Circus Circus  We booked the   Queens before and switched to the CC  when they offered a  quot pay   nights and stay   quot   That way it was pretty cheap      Euros for two tower rooms overall   We stayed at the Stratosphere the night before and this was clean and good  review follows   The Circus Circus was neither good nor clean When we first wanted to check in    pm  there was a line of about     people  So we turned and came back around      pm  It was way better now   only about   people queuing  Nevertheless it took about ten minutes until it was our turn  The receptionist was friendly  but he didn t know  if any shops are open on Thanksgiving  and he charged us     for each room  He explained  that this would be for local calls  we told him  that we have cell phones and wouldn t call from our room  Didn t have any effect Our room was on the   th floor  From the parking garage  full of honking cars during the whole day  we had to take the elevator one floor down  walk through the crowd in their shopping mile about    m to another set of elevators  There are four elevators going to our floor  but half of them were out of duty for two days  To make things worse  there are two elevators in front of them  which serve the lower floors  Usually there was a crowd waiting for the first elevators and you couldn t get through to the elevators behind  which we needed   I went to my room to get my laptop and left after about    seconds  Nevertheless it took me over ten minutes to get to our car  I heard elevators passing my floor  but never stopping Our room was the next unpleasant surprise  All lamps and the alarm clock were unplugged  which wouldn t be a problem normally  To plug the clock we had to pull the bed about   cm from the wall  unfortunately we saw now  that the space there wasn t cleaned for as many years as the hotel is old  Good thing we didn t eat before checking in  Next to the curtains we found a bottle of nail polish  which survived the  quot cleaning quot  after the residents before moved out On our floor we had some youth football team  there was some championship going on in town   who held their meetings and apparently their practise  running and jumping  in the hallway  No chance for some quiet time and even walking to the elevators was an enormous task  The rest of the hotel was full with aforementioned youth football teams and tons of families with lots of children  No one looked friendly and most of them seemed to imitate street gangs  As a surplus the casino smelled from cigarettes  cheap booze and in some corners urine  although we came home twice around   am we never saw someone cleaning outside the rooms  One elevator had a vomit smell for three straight days  I guess i covered it all now This was my fourth trip to Las Vegas and by far the worst hotel  even the now destroyed Stardust was way better  Our opinion   quot Please  please tear down this casino next  Even an empty hole in this spot is better than this  quot  
N =>   Circus Circus was Great   The main lobby might look a little shabby but you have to remember the huge amount of traffic that comes through  We did NOT have to wait in line  the hostess was very friendly and helpful  We had a room in the tower and it was clean  nice and had comfy beds Our hair dryer did not work but within   minutes of asking  staff brought a brand new one in  The windows however were dirty and hard to see through  so no picture taking out the windows The buffet was a good value  also there is a McDonalds inside  that was good since we had   children with us We all had a great time at the Adventuredome and watching the cirucs acts  also enjoyed the arcade room  The hallways were quiet  we probaly picked a good time of the year to go Overall the value was amazing  we paid under        a night for four of us   my husband and I and    and    yr  old grandchildren  We had one room with double beds and it was plenty large enough  Missed the coffeemaker though  they should definitely add that to the rooms All in all  great value  and a great time had by all  
N =>   Fantastic for the price stay in the Tower  You get what you pay for  We got more   for a discount rate  the room was fantastic  NOT perfect  but better than an interstate motel   or the Stratosphere room we had last year  Better stays to be had in the tower rooms  Not too many kids  good thing about going in ember  No one should be shocked if at any time the place is full of kids   it s attractions are geared toward them  Check in was fast at midnight  easy to check out through the TV system  For the record  Slots of Fun is gross  couldn t bring ourselves to buy a       beer from there   need to get rid of the grease     vomit scent  
N =>   Not   us the time My boyfriend and I stayed here at the time due to it being the cheapest  It was my bf  st time going to Vegas  but my  thrd time  I stayed at the Fitz the  nd time I went  in y      and a Days Inn the  st time I went    yrs ago  LOL   The previous hotels which were in no way nice to my standards were WAY better than the room we got at Circus Circus  The bed felt as though it was nothing more than a box spring  The carpet was disgusting  Our view was decent but nothing I hoped for  for my bf to experience  The buffet was GROSS         I have been reading a lot of the other reviews and WOW the rooms that other ppl got seem amazing compared to what we were given  Out of the   times previous to going to Vegas I had no idea about the whole upgrade thing   I know silly me  that is what I get for not joining tripadvisor until just recently   Anyways  we are going back to Vegas again this       and now I have more insight on it for us  Thank you all for all the input and pictures you put on here  it helps so much keep it up and when I return from my trip in      I will for sure be uploading my pics to share with you all and my review of where we stay   We are looking into staying at TI  or Bill s  or Harrah s  or Excaliber  or Luxor  I know lots of choices and we just haven t been able to decide all the way yet   Circus Circus might be in there as well with our choices if of course we can book one of those newer rooms   LOL   Well goodbye until next time I am on here to give you all a review   
N =>   Depressing experience My family needed a place to stay for one night only as we were leaving early the next day  We chose Circus Circus for its proximity to the RV Rental Location where we were to pick up our RV the next day so we were not expecting or wanting much Arriving at   h    we found the lobby to be filled with many  many families and their luggage  Some were asleep on the couches  others sprawled out  Not a pleasant welcome  Were these people waiting for a bus somewhere  I have no clue but it gave the lobby a  quot homeless shelter quot  feeling We went to check in where there was fortuantely no line  Our clerk noted that my credit card had a mildly faded signature  I offered photo ID  passport  driver s license etc   to confirm that I was indeed the cardholder for this previously booked and prepaid room  The clerk informed me that photo ID is insufficient and that I should resign the card then and there  Gee  does this not preclude the reason for signing a card in the first place  I guess a fraud artist would never think of doing this We proceeded to our room  One elevator did not work though it was not clearly marked or otherwise indicated as out of order  The doors on the  working  elevators close too quickly  My family barely got in before the doors closed  We are not slow walkers either  We went to our room which was ok for   h    It was not fancy but was clean enough  The bathroom was dated  The shower was weak  The overall feeling was  please renovate me  One problem was the curtains did not dim out the street lights entirely so if you need near darkness to sleep  watch out  I went down to the casino to unwind while my family went to sleep  Very old and dated as well  The place reminded me of old casino meets a shabby coney island  Very depressing The staff were on the whole pleasant and receptive Would I stay here again  I do not think so as there are equally reasonably priced places on the Strip that are superior  It was adequate enough for one night but we will not be returning  
N =>   great stay from cambs ukstayed november     read all reviews before going and had mixed views but arrived at airport in afternoon and taxi to hotel    dollers took us to reception at rear not at front as some people said  took about    mins to check in asked for view of strip given sky rise room with   double beds and a no smoking one as was given the choice  clean and well stocked with towels and on   th floor  as there was only   of us we could not fault for the price  tried few of resturants and found good choice even the all you could eat steak dinner for    dollers and was asked if we wanted some more steak once we finished the first one  room cleaned every day with new towels and shampoos  safe charged    cents to use each time so did not mind  one doller a day for local calls used a few times to book shows  took trip to grand caynon by papelon tours by plane hele and boat with lunch included and only four of us in helecopter so had great time no faults  for being in seedy area as some reviews said only time i could see the mens clubs or areas of this nature was from hotel window on   th floor and they were not on the strip these clubs  you get more people on the strip pestering you for time share or trying to give cards for certain phone numbers they were more annoying   booked some shows back in uk before going with travelocity and did not have any problems when over there getting tickets of them when arrived  so overall we had a excellent   days and would go back to this hotel again for price and standards we had if people want more then go and pay a lot more at some of the other hotels on the strip  one othe point we liked about this hotel it was about in the middle as we walked to bottom end of strip from here and to fermont street in the other direction  hotel did run a airport bus we found out and cost   dollers each to go back to airport so not bad 
N =>  Damp mold infested rooms Horrible customer service To begin with  I requested a non smoking room  but was still placed in a smoking room  It was too late at night to go somewhere else I tolerated torcher for the whole night  The room was damp  the bathroom was infested with mold  Old rotting furniture  stinking pillows Ameneties    A mirror hanging on a wall in the name of dresser   No coffee maker    coffee  No free internet  You pay       per day   Have one iron  but no power receptacle to plug in near the iron board  All of them have been sealed in clear violation of building codes Customer Service  On second day  I requested to provide me a non smoking room  The resposne was   quot We have not even single room available for YOU  Can anyone believe that  out of      rooms not even one was available Next morning at checkout  I spoke with supervisor  His response was  Non smoking room is  quot Just a Request quot  It is not gurranteed I would not reccomment anybody go this horrible place and pay         per night  I think mom pop motels in     per night are better in terms of amenities and level of servce  At least they can not be discourteous  
N =>  Yuck Do yourself a favour and beware We had read in lots of places that this is the best place to stay with a family  but I think travel agents need to come and have a look  This may have been the place about    years ago  but not now The hotel is old and run down in many areas  and needs upgrading   or demolishing  The rooms themselves are OK  but all the other bad bits are overwhelming Firstly taxis drop you at the Strip entrance  so you need to walk thru the casino  which is smoky  smelly and dingy Had to wait in line for over half an hour to check in We stayed in the Skyrise Tower   thought it was recently upgraded  but it s not    which meant we had to walk thru tacky  tacky arcade  with people selling all sorts of rubbish Bathroom was smelly  beds are Ok  but not really up to modern day hotel standards  remote control didnt work  smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling Internet at     per day extra  having the luxury of a phone  even without use  is    per room  costs     if you have an extended stay of ONE HOUR Buffet is good  but always had to queue for around    minutes to get in It s located at the far end of the strip We wonder who exactly is posting positive reviews of this hotel  Delighted to leave  wouldn t recommend this to anyone  
N =>  Nice Room in West Tower We were lucky we read the reviews and booked us a king bed room in the newly renovated West Tower I have to say for under     a night  our king bed west tower room is absolutely a five star indulgence  Hotel website had the picture of the room and what you see is what you get  Our bed and pillows are so comfortable  I don t even wanna get out of it    inch LCD TV  but not many free TV channels No wireless internet  but there were so much to do  I didn t even get a chance to turn on my laptop for our   night stay If you are on a budget  remeber to get the visit las vegas guide  even the free shows will keep you occupied every day We loved the circus show every half an hour  But don t miss the TI pirate ship  Rio dance gals  Bellagio fountain  MGM lion  lots to see even if you are on a budget Circus buffet was the cheapest  but our buffet in Rio was the best I will stay at Circus Circus again if I don t get a free TimeShare offer from any other hotel  afterall  this is the cheapest option on the strip  
N =>  Sucked In At The Circus THIS PLACE IS A DUMP  we had to go thru several rooms to get satisfied enough to at least stay on  Every corner you turn someone has their hand out   A complete milking in everything from the double the quoted room price to the    bucks to use the internet each day  no mail service and   bucks a pop to receive a fax  The place is old so the deterioration was explainable  the lack caring staff and general lack of enthusiasm makes the place a horror to have to go home to each evening  the cigarette smoke is so bad in the casino we couldnt gamble there  we had to gamble elsewhere Lets face it with the face of vegas constantly changing it might be time for circus circus to do the dynamite thing and rebuild and move into the modern age  Oh the Buffet was okay not the best rated in vegas as they claim 
N =>   Second Visit   Even better than the  st   This was my second stay at this hotel  and it was fabulous   Check in was quick  and after making a call to the hotel some weeks before to request conjoining rooms  they told me it would depend on the availability on the day  Lucky for us we got one  In the main tower on the   th floor  We had a re furbished room  which was very comfortable and very clean  it was very clean the  st time anyway too Hotel staff were great  and we always seemed to end up with the nicest  the staff that get the taxi s for you  are these doormen   We did mile and miles of walking everyday  went to almost every hotel during our stay  saw most of the attractions  and walked to the sign  which seemed a lot closer this tme An example of how great the staff were  one evening i had a fall in the Hotel room which resulted in me being taken to hospital to hve stitches  but the hotel staff were fab  They sent security to the room first to assess the damage  then the sherrif  the the paramedics  They knew we were messing around in the room  but not once did they judge us  nor did the paramedics  I recieved a letter from the hotel today passing on their best wishes in my recovery  Something i wasnt expecting at all We flew with Virgin Atlantic  which i had done before  and have never been too keen on them anyway  But out outbound journey was horrendous    something you dont want at the start of your holiday  The service was terrible  We were served our   bitesize meals  but only once offered beverages after this  On a    hour flight i feel this is awful  When my friend found a hostess and asked for beverages he was told he had to wait until they had their break  I understand they need a break  but they were ALL on break at the same time  The hostesses werent even friendly either  Our return journey was much better I have no other grumble what so ever about this holiday  But as i plan to return again in a couple of years  does anyone know of any other airlines that fly direct as i dont fancy flying with virgin again Had a fab time    Will definalty go back and stay   Circus Circus   
N =>   Stay someplace else My wife and I were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Las Vegas that was also clean and comfortable  so we booked one of the newly renovated West Tower Rooms on the Circus Circus website  After waiting on a long check in line  we were told that the type of room we had booked was not available  even though we paid for the first night in advance   We explained that we didn t want to stay in a different part of the hotel  we remembered the web site pictures of these rooms  which were older and dingier   and were eventually given a West Tower Room  However  what they didn t tell us was that the room they gave us had two small beds instead of one larger bed  By the time we got to the room around  am  we were too exhausted to complain  We would not recommend this hotel  
N =>   Just Okay We stayed in the skyrise tower  on the very top floor  It wasn t very straightforward to navigate through the hotel without a map  The room was clean and tidy but reeked of smoke in the bathroom even though it was a non smoking room  Check in was slow and tedious  But on the plus side staff were helpful and accomodating  Buffet was value for money  
N =>  check in needs improving Rooms were a great size were in rooms near the adventure dome and pool we thought the buffet had improved since we stopped there   years ago maybe the hotel needs a little re fit but overall not bad for the price you pay all i would say it took us       hrs to check inn yes i know the hotel has alot of rooms but when you see check in desks untended when the queue is very long just think it could be improved    
N =>  Best deal on strip excelent deal   nights  and  rd night free  It cost me less than        dollars  SkyRise tower is not that bad  especially i only need a place to sleep 
N =>  Gambled with CC service       and lost I stayed at Circus Circus for a night in early       after staying a few other times over the past    years  What a difference a few years makes  It was always on the lower end in terms of niceties and services  but it s now crumbling My problems could be summarized with    I took a shower and the water refused to turn off  it took them forever to send someone up to try to fix it   The ceiling was literally crumbling onto me while in the shower   The next morning I took another shower and the water again refused to turn off  I didn t even bother calling it in  figuring someone would find it after I checked out since they didnt  seem to care about it while I was a guest   It was an exciting shower  however  as the maid not only came in the room  but opened the shower curtain while I was in the shower  I couldn t believe it  she didn t even announce herself or ask if anyone was in the room  Just barged right into the shower  She was embarassed and apologetic  but there s no excuse for this Ultimately  none of this are the engineer s or the maid s fault  It s the fault of the people who are supposed to manage them and train them  This has become a shoddy hotel and I would stay away  
N =>   Keep your expectations low and you ll be just fine  Stayed   nights at this hotel with   other friends for a girls trip  We stayed in a room on the   th floor in the Skyrise Towers  The room itself was a fair size considering there were   adults to accommodate The linens in our room were clean  and the   queen sized beds were pretty comfortable  The kleenex box in our bathroom was empty though  which wasn t a big deal since we had to call housekeeping for more pillows and towels anyways  No fridge or coffee maker in the room  but there was an iron and ironing board  Also there is a safe that takes   cents to use each time you want to lock it  Bathroom was equipped with a hairdryer  and cheap generic soaps  shampoo conditioner  The showerhead had a really hard water pressure  which my friends with long hair told me was awesome  but I thought it was a touch too hard on my skin   but the drain in the tub seemed clogged as the water collected around your feet  The sink in there could use a good de clogging too  The shower curtain was also positioned in very close so the shower space was probably     inches more narrow than I was accustomed to  and I m not a particularly big person   It was particularly unpleasant when the curtain would start to float inwards due to the hot steam and would touch my skin Within the sleeping area  the floor appeared to be clean  but there was a definite white line of dust collection behind the beds and under the aircondition system where the vacuum couldn t reach  Inside the armoire and on top of the tv was also a layer of dust the maids must ve missed  The airconditioner worked well though  it worked hard and loudly but kept us cool as we liked to keep it at around   F    C  There was a long line at check in and had a system very reminiscent of a bank line which took about   minutes in total  The gentleman that I checked in with was very courteous and helpful though  He gave us detailed instructions of how to get to our rooms  which was a good thing as it was a fair trek away from registration  To get to the skyrise towers you must go up the elevators to the  nd floor  and proceed to walk through the  quot promenade quot  which is much akin to a street fair  before going through a small section of casino and up another set of elevators  It was a bit of a hassle  trying to navigate through the crowds and pushy vendors with all your luggage Pushy vendors  Oh yes  The promenade is made up of all sorts of salesfolk trying to grab your attention and persuade you to buy their goods    god forbid you should make any eye contact with them  I certainly didn t see any of this action at Treasure Island or the Mirage lol  After the  th day you do learn to walk fast and ignore their pitches CC tries to be more family oriented  and in saying that  the free circus acts up in the midway are pretty entertaining  no  it s not cirque du soleil  it s free   but the pool closes at  pm and some of the restaurants closes at  pm  There were only a few kids around since school had already started so I didn t notice any of them running around the casino area to get to the midway  but there were a few splashies in the pool from them To keep this review from being longer than a novel  I ll finish by saying that CC is an old hotel and definitely shows its age  The price is cheap and you can t go in with high expectations or else you ll be really disappointed  If you re on a budget then this is a great place to stay  
N =>   Not great     booked for  nts upgraded to a    not worth it  hotel smelt  room in main tower was the most basic i ever stayed in  not even a teas made  the beds were the lumoyest ever  wokr every  hrs sore and had to turn   made do cause it was only for  nts 
N =>   Terrible experience  More like a zoo than an circus First  there was a lower rate online but when you clicked  quot register quot  nothing happened so you HAD to call the hotel  When I got to the hotel  the lines were outrageous and unorganized  We got a AAA rate  but were not given the  quot deal quot  that was online and then even charged a  quot fee quot  for the telephone even though we never even touched it  The rooms were filthy and smelly  When we woke up  my kids and I all had bites on our arms and legs I could go on and on about the sticky table and dirty cups at dinner inside the hotel  but I ll refrain to say that I will never stay there again  Very disappointing  
N =>  Circus Circus Does Not   Family Friendly Booked one night on the back end of a long trip to the West  and I ve gotta say  other than the room itself being perfectly adequate  I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this hotel In general  smelled bad  is extraordinarily confusing to get around  even by Vegas standards  limited and relatively poor food selections  and staff that were courteous  but certainly nothing special or helpful One word of caution  The name and theme are misleading  Like virtually everything else on the Strip  this place is NOT truly family friendly  unless you re OK with  mildly  provocative circus acts and a truly adult atmosphere  But hey  it s a casino  right  Don t mistake it for a  quot circus quot  atmosphere  and you might be fine Our room was in Circus Circus Manor  closest building to main tower  Room was huge  generally clean  and very comfortable  Took about    minutes to walk to Center Strip area  Bellagio  Paris  Bally s  etc       Parking garage absolutely massive  but in the Manor  you can park right outside your room Not a place we d stay again  Stayed at Excalibur earlier on the same trip  and would say it was far superior  despite smaller rooms and same casino smoky smell  
N =>   Good for the price Stayed here for  nyts earlier in the year  amp  had no problems  Stayed in the tower rooms  not the refurbed one s   amp  they were fine  We all know that this isn t one of the top hotels on the strip but then you don t pay top prices either  Wasn t the best room I have ever stayed in but was clean enough  amp  plenty of space  Is a bit up the strip but the deuce bus does the job to get around  If I was to go to Vegas again I think i d pay the little bit extra  amp  stay in the Excalibur  Pretty much the same class of hotel but bit better location  If you re booked at this hotel  amp  are concerned about some of the bad reviews  don t worry  With the amount of miles you walk every day you d be happy sleeping in a tent in the car park    
N =>   Most Family Friendly Hotel on the Strip We stayed here for part of our honeymoon and was quite pleased with the atmosphere  We consider it to be the most family friendly hotel on the strip  The room was clean and comfortable  The only problem was the long line waiting to check in  
N =>  O K Just got back from Vegas a week in Circus  rd to   th august Stayed in Manor Wing expecting horror stories but it was ok cleaned every day nice big beds ice machine outside Only ate there once to dear and food not much kop Hardest part trying to get out of hotel fat people everywhere had my grandson with us and he dident go on any of the rides Took    minutes to check in Wouldent stay here again  
N =>   Best Value On The Strip Whilst this is easily the best value on the Strip we were anticipating at least a slight drop in standard from other Casino hotels we had stayed  this was not the case Check in was a doddle  unlike some the stories we had read  but it took no time at all  Especially a the cark par is so close to the check in desk One thing we did regret was not taking a room on one of the higher floors  we were on the  rd  The receptionist said we would get a better view on the higher floors and we took this to mean a better view of the strip  but as we found out our view was blocked by a wall On check in you are given a variety of vouchers eg  two for one at the buffet  free gambling etc  We didn t use them all but the buffet was good  though have a short wait in the queue The room was of the standard you would expect form the Las Vegas Strip  ample room and comfortable Lots to do there but we were there only two night we didn t manage to llok at all the attraction on offer  Would have liked to have stayed a bit longer Good base if you want see the North Strip  Short walk to the Stratasphere Tower  Treasure Island  Venitian  Also not too far from Freemont Street Experience  which is highly recommended  though you will need transport Only regret is that we didn t stay longer  
N =>   It s a horrible place worst than motels  The rooms were not clean and the sheets felt dirty  The beds were horrible  you can feel the springs in the bed  They would put padding on one bed and not the other  When you complain  they switch you to other rooms in the area  but all the Manor rooms had horrible beds  It s worst than sleeping on the floor  When we asked for a room upgrade  they told us everything is completely booked out  After switching to like   different rooms  we finally got settled with a full refund and booked at another hotel  Don t ever stay here  
N =>  The worst Not a pleasant experience  because of   Very dirty carpet    Cushion on one of only two chairs provided  in a room for   people  was wet and one of the three lamps wasn t working    It took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to bring a light bulb and to exchange the disgusting chair with another that was not wet  but quite stained    We chose the manor room over the main hotel room because it offers a fridge  However  the fridge is small and noisy    Personal safety concerns      The main entrance door was propped open with a towel as the security lock didn t work  When somebody removed the towel  either unknowingly or because of security concerns  it meant that guests couldn t get back to their rooms      We had drunk people sleep right outside our room lying in the hallway  There was no security provided We would not stay again no matter how good the deal  
N =>   Motel   without the amenities We stayed here with family  ages        I needed a place where we could be separate from the casinos  but close to the fun so my    yr old mother would not have to walk too much to enjoy the trip  First  we asked for a room on ground floor and were told they couldn t do that  but would put us close to the elevators  They put us right by the stairs but farthest away from the elevators  We had   rooms  Two were nice enough and clean  One smelled like something died under the bed  My sister sprayed air freshener every time we opened the door  and the smell never lessened  The beds were hard  you could feel the springs in the mattress  I didn t even know they had springs in mattresses any more  The pillows were flat  Otherwise  everything was nice enough  I didn t notice any stains or dirt or mold  The showers were nice enough I was most frustrated with the coffee situation  I didn t realize how frustrating it is to have to walk ten miles to get a cup of coffee  At least in Motel    you can walk to the lobby in the morning and get a cup  The Manor is a block away from the main hotel  and once you make your way over there  you still have to meander around to find a coffee shop  I didn t mind having to pay for coffee  but it was        and it was bitter  I thought that this hotel would be a great place for all ages to hang out  but you have to go through the casinos to get anywhere  In fact  at midnight  we saw small children who had apparently won stuffed animals at the midway sleeping in the hallway outside the casinos  sacked out on their new toys  There was no seating anywhere  except in the casinos  so my mom  who is on a walker  couldn t just sit and watch the kids play  In fact  when we were checking in  we stood in line for    minutes  and there was no place to sit and wait  I thought the staff were very nice  but it just didn t serve our needs  I will say that   out of   rooms were nice enough  esp for the price we were paying  And we felt safe enough   I read one review that mentioned being held up by gunpoint   We saw bicycle police everywhere  One young man came around asking people for change  but when we said no  he moved on without any threat  Anyone who chooses to stay here should bring his her own coffee  and be prepared to walk a long way  We drove in  so it was very nice to have our car close by for loading and for moving around the town  I would have hated to have to use the valet service every time we wanted to drive somewhere  
N =>   you get wat u pay for went to manor lodge in circus circus for our   th wedding anniversary our main part of our holiday was hawaii so only wanted a cheap place to stay and also didn t want a high rise building  it isn t to bad the smell that other people hav wrote about is carpet cleaner which they seem to put down on the carpets in the mornings when they r cleaning its only in the first part of the building  there is no kettle or coffee maker in the rooms so if u want one u will hav to take your own  we stayed on the ground floor which wasn t very good as we didn t open our curtains as there was a car park right outside our window so everyone could see straight in also the window was bolted up so if u had to get out in an emergency u couldn t  i wouldn t stay there again if i went to vegas again i would stay in a different hotel  circus circus is not right on the strip so i would stay closer to everything as a lot of walking or bus rides  the buffets were good in some hotels but not so good in others  we found circus circus was cheap and ok but the mirage  luxor was dearer but better  the excaliber was also nice and not to expensive we went to grand canyon in helicopter  heli usa  we had   people in the helicopter plus pilot it was very crowded  we went on the ranch wasn t much to see or do there the only good thing was one cowboy there who sang to us everything was rushed  we brought the dvd they sold which we thought was going to b about us but it was about   mins of us then the rest was advertising  the staff in the main part of the hotel weren t very helpful we tried to make a phone call home as our mobiles wouldn t work there but noone really wanted to help us with the phones there be warned don t walk round all hotels on your first day as u won t b able to walk again the hotels arn t as close together as they seem  get the duece bus    dollars for a   day pass    dollars   hrs and   dollars one way  
N =>   Should have stayed at a Motel     The Circus Manor  slums of circus circus  is a separate building that sits across from the main towers  Upon entering the room two lights did not work  The beds were as if we brought our own cots  The safe had a hole in it and there was no lock  The stench was that of smoke  must and    years of drugs  prostitution and mold  We had to take all our luggage and haul it across the street to the manor which was a pain  It is not even relatively close to the casino in the hotel  nor was it close to any strip  So if you want to stay at a place where you could wake up and go down to the casino   do not stay in the Circus Manor  Upon complaining to the front desk  we received a free room upgrade to the main tower where the hotel is  And while that room was significantly better flat screen tv  kingsize pillow top bed beautiful scenery and clean bathroom   it is not even close to the glamor rooms of better more upscale hotels on the strip  The Manor rooms were like a bad dream and my spouse and I were scared of being mugged while walking back and forth from the  quot main quot  hotel  Word of advice   DO NOT STAY HERE  Spend the extra cash to enjoy your stay  otherwise it will ruin your vacation  I can see why the circus is free  they needed to provide more incentive  
N =>   Needs to be demo I have stayed in some motels that looked  smelled and felt better than this  quot hotel quot   My husband wanted to surprise me with a last minute trip to Vegas  He booked everything  the Circus Circus Manor was the cheapest  quot hotel quot  he could find  Once we arrived I noticed why  The bed sheets were dirty  the room smelled like      just bad  
N =>   If you smoke this is your place  First let me pointout we were staying at CC just for the night as we drove thru Vegas on our way to Disneyland  Needless to say we were looking for something inexpensive  You surely get what you pay for First impressions are scarey as the parking lot was a circus to get thru  The crowd of people walking around was also scarey  You could pick out the prostitutes waiting in the lobby for their Jon  We choose not to eat at any of the restaurants within and instead drove across freeway to eat at Macaroni Grill  very nice   Landry s was next door  Check in was not so bad until we got to our room  in main tower and the keycards would not work  We had to go back to the front desk   times in attempt to fix the problem  After the  rd try they ended up upgrading us to a nicer room in the West tower  The registeror commented they were over booked by    rooms  While to the room was clean and nicely decorated  it was so smokey we could hardly breathe  Anytime you see an ashtray in the bathroom it is not a good sign  I travle with feebreze and candles and that still did not help the smell  The air conditioner worked good but my husband felt it brought in more smoke  Suprisingly the beds were very comfortable and the pillows were even goose down  We had a good night sleep until our kids woke us up at     am raring to go  We took advantage of the chance to check out early and get on the road again to our final destination  We ate breakfast at the Denny s across the street on Vegas Blvd  Service good and fast  We did not go on any of the rides since we were taking kids to Disneyland the next day  
N =>  You get what you pay for  simple as that  It really is not as bad as people claim  sure it is old and needs repairs  and updating but so would you if you had that many people tromping all over you day in and day out   YES there are a lot of kids there  We stayed in the Manor B main floor over New Years       with our   teenagers    yr olds  and infant daughter  the teenagers enjoyed it  they had the chance to go and check out the AdventureDome and had a good time on the rides and with the games  We had considered staying in the towers but once we got to the hotel I am glad we did not  it is a complete zoo to park  to get on the elevator  in the Manor rooms you park your own vehicle and you can park it where you can see it from your room  Check in  only took about    mins  we were pre registered and had no problems with lost registration etc  we had our confirmation letter with us and it was smooth sailing  And we checked in on the   th of ember  which is one of the busiest days to check in at the CC Our Room  Like I said it was in Manor B  the room was very large  everything worked  altho the toilet was a bit noisy  the towels were white and fluffy  not dungy or dirty  worn etc  The sheets and bed spreads were clean and the beds were comfortable no springs poking out   we had clean towels each and every day  and the room cleaned and vacuumed every day  The few times we called housekeeping to get more towels or pillows and a new bedspread after baby peed on the other one it was delivered our room in plastic with in    mins  Nothing was stolen out of all our luggage  and trust me we had a lot as we were at the end of a month long trip  so we had purchased a lot of things and brought it all in our rooms in rubbermad totes as we did not want to leave it in the truck as we went about our sightseeing  There was security at each door of the Manor and they did not let anyone in that did not have a card  The room walls are a bit thin so you can hear the tv in the room next to you  but for the most part it did not matter  we were not there that much other then to sleep and when we finally did get back we were too tired to care  The bathroom was very very clean  I was not worried about putting my   mos old baby in the tub at all  Check out went just as fast as the check in  and there is a       day charge for the phone  We had pre paid the hotel bill in order to get the reduced rate for the   nights we stayed there  so we were wondering how many extras would be added  but it was only the phone  so we were happy to see that was the only charge  All in All   you get what you pay for  if you don t like kids stay away  if you don t like average run of the mill rooms in a busy hotel  don t book the manor rooms  
N =>  Over priced Staff is Rude Dirty Well first off we go to check in and they tell me no kids are suppose to stand because of the machines ok so what was i going to do leave my   yr old outside while i checked in  Than my mother in law had to use the restroom so me and my son waited by the door of the rest room   security gaurds comes over and tells me once again no kids to stand because of the machines ok well than he says its on non stopping zone alright well how did i know where are the stopping zones so i tell the secutity i only booked this place for my son since it has rides games had lots to do for kids  He says well this is not a kids place  ok i understand it is a casino but if you where not trying to attract the kids why would you put a roller coaster in   a water ride ex tell me what   yr old person wants to go on a roller coaster So than we go to our room now i have to tell you my father in law is handicap and my mother in law has bad knees they give us a room that we had to walk through the whole darn place felt like a mile than we are put up on the highest floor  when we opened the door it looked like a    hr place where you bring a fling  it was dirty smelly and the carpets where all stained  We complained and they did give us another room which was very nice But than we decide to eat in the pizza place   well you have to cross the gaming floor to get to the pizza place what do you know the security officers want to come over to yell again about no kids on the gaming floor   how the yeck can we get to the pizza place without going across the floor It was a complete let down the whole place  For one all the time i got yelled at about the gaming floor i don t even gamble  i came to this hotel for my son Its not a very friendly place to stay at all  Another thing for the guard saying its not a kids place their sign has a clown holding a lollipop rollercoaster water ride and sponge bob movie i don t know of any adult that watches sponge bob for the yeck of it we all end up watching sponge bob because of the kids my mother in law and father in law did not want to go to circus circus for the rides or the video games or the sponge bob movie They came for their grandson I will never ever recommend this dump to anyone Plus one of the staff sad no speak english  well i don t speak spanish so before they get a job there they should be able to speak english considering this is america and if i went to another country i would have to try to learn their language  
N =>  Checked in     checked out We booked a room at Circus circus after staying at another hotel for   days  We had a very late flight and thought for     we had a place to stay for the day  The early check in at   am took over   hour in line  We then got our keys and were given a map to the  nd Manor building  It was over     degrees and we had to gather the luggage thru the parking lots  then to the  nd building I was shocked  The building smelled  was dirty   I felt very sorry for the families I saw    this is a vacation  Our room had dirty chairs   the bathroom was rusted and moldy  I have never seen anything like it  We checked out and spent the day at the airport  It was a much better choice  I am shocked that anyone would think these substandard conditions are OK  I called the management when we returned home  I explained we did not go back to the desk because we were unable to speak to anyone unless we stood back in the hour long line  No one shoud stay here   it was terrible  
N =>   Filthy rowdy and a bit scary  Stayed here for one night with a friend  I was supposed to be there my entire stay in Las Vegas  and after my experience I am glad I found someone else to stay with  Another friend and I arrived at almost midnight to be greeted at the entrance by unsupervised delinquent children of all ages  some of which  the teenagers  were being escorted from the building for their misbehavior  There was vandalism all over the grounds  The smell of smoke was profound in the main building  and the manor buildings smelled smoky and musty  Had I not been so completely exhausted after we came back from more gambling at around   am  I wouldn t have been able to sleep in the dump  The springs in the bed jabbed against my side  and the sheets didn t seem clean  I made the unfortunate choice of planning on showering there  The bathroom was simply unacceptable   not just out of date but in disrepair and filthy  I have stayed in hostels that I d sooner shower in bare feet  The towels were paper thin and looked to be decades old  with a disgusting greyish brown tint to the nap  as if they hadn t been properly cleaned  The locks were the standard programmable key card type  but I didn t feel secure either about access to the building itself or to the rooms  I had no idea what to expect  as my friend made the booking  I didn t know how much he paid for the room until afterwards    Even for the dirt cheap rates he got      night  there is no excuse for the condition of the rooms  Had I known  I would have chucked in a few extra bucks to get him to stay somewhere better Felt like I was going to contract a disease every time I touched a surface in this place If you really need to save money  stay a block or two off the strip at Holiday Inn or something similar  If you can t afford to stay somewhere a little nicer       a night  then you don t need to be visiting Las Vegas   believe me  you will regret a stay at this hotel  
N => 	Things to Hate About the Circus Circus    Low income client le  mostly from third world countries     Low ceilings  narrow spaces  and small  unremarkable casino    Worthless coupons      of this n  that  one free side bet  buy one get one free buffet and adventure dome vouchers     Pay per use safes  No coffee machine  No microwaves available      a night cribs  Plastic disposable cups     quot No Unloading quot  sign at the lobby entrance  but the valets will actually reluctantly give you   minutes  after which they will  quot politely quot  tell you to shove off and that  quot you re responsible if anyone hits your car  quot    Noisy in room HVAC    One of three lifts working in the cramped and almost always near full garages    Talking an elevator to the second floor from the main lobby  crossing the Promenade  and walking thru the main casino to get to the only elevators leading to the Skyrise Tower    SLOW SLOW SLOW check in  Took us    minutes at the counter  and we had a pre paid reservation  What was the clerk doing with all that furious typing     I got exactly what I paid for  which was not much  
N =>   You do get what you pay for  I stayed in the Manor when visiting Vegas with my parents and cousin We requested two interconnecting non smoking rooms and this was exactly what we got  Check in only took    mins    of those were the clerk trying to find suitable rooms Rooms were clean  fridges both worked  Aircon was a little noisy but then it was only really needed during the day  Bathrooms are small but functional There are no coffee making facilites but we just went to wal mart and bought a kettle and   mugs  Morning cup of tea problem solved for less than     Housekeeping was very good  extra pillows requested turned up in    mins  sheets changed when card placed on them  Maintanence were equally swift  a fault with the aircon was reported at      and fixed by the time we came back at      Safe in room eats a quarter every time you lock it and didn t look like it would take much to get into it  but since we put our passports in the main hotel cage this wasn t really a problem Not all the TV channels worked  but then we didn t spend an awful lot of time in the rooms watching TV Didn t use the pool but there were plenty of kids in there the night before thanksgiving and they seems to be enjoying themselves It is a fair walk to the main casino but there are walkways to assist  We liked the fact that you can park the car right outside the block rather than the   mile hike through the casino to the multi story car park No problems checking out The manor isn t fancy  and it is starting to show it s age slightly  but it is cheaper than some of the more overblown hotels at the top end of the strip  If you have a car like we did  and even better  a non drinker in your party  then this is a great place to stay if you are on a budget  
N =>  Sorry Folks Park is Closed   The Moose Out Front Should Have Told You  In keeping with the  Themed Hotel  experience in Vegas  the Circus Circus Manor did a wonderful job of making me feel like I was staying in a Slum  Apparently Vegas was  broken  in general on this trip  But for this review  I ll stick to the items at this property exclusively Broken Item      card key reader at Manor Building E front entrance  RESOLUTION  prop door open with bucket so card key not necessary for entrance to buildingBroken Item      room safe did good job of taking my quarter   bad job of letting me remove the key to lock it  RESOLUTION  Get different room or live w o a safe according to their maintenance men staff   we gladly took a different room in the hotel tower Broken Item      Adventure Dome leaks badly from recent rains  RESOLUTION  a strategic placement of painter s buckets and caution tape  Broken Item      Skyway Shuttle to take us from the back of the hotel to the front RESOLUTION  noneBroken Item      about   the escalators  RESOLUTION  take the stairsBroken Item      soda vending machine took my money  did not dispense beverage  RESOLUTION  None   but I did have some kids point and laugh at me telling me it s broken  Apparently I was not the only one who got the raw end of this deal  good times   thanks kids Broken Item      Fire alarm in the Adventure Dome and surrounding shops and resturaunts was tripped resulting in near deafness and epileptic seizures from the stobing effect Other items that weren t really  broken  but were not up to par were  disgusting shower curtains   moldy shower grout toilet that leaned to the left  stinky towels 
N =>  Too far from everything This motel was very basic  The walk to the main hotel is long  The pool was just your basic pool  Its very hard to go back to this ho hum place after visiting the beautiful hotels of Las Vegas I would NOT go back to this motel  
N =>  Would not stay there again I stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel  Manor Suites  which is separate from the Tower  the main building  for a show my son was a part of  th of y weekend       First off  let me say that the manor suites are like staying at a motel  There is a totally separate facility  parking lot  buildings  pool  etc   which was extremely inconvenient considering the     degree weather  If you want to go eat  you have to cross the street to the main building  if your key gets lost or if they go bad  you have to cross the street  if you need anything  you have to cross the street to the main tower to see concierge  front desk support  if you want to go gambling or to eat  and the list goes on and on  again you have to cross walk across the parking  cross the street  go through the indoor parking lot then to the main tower  The rooms have just beds and a phone  no pamphlets or brochures for advice on the areas attractions  etc  The pool area was crowded  the pool was cloudy and there was nothing fancy about it  no water fall  diving board  slide  nothing  Just hot concrete  and warm water  and even that is a treck from the manor rooms  The service by every employee I came into contact with was average  non helpful and sometimes rude  everyone from maid servers  amusement park personnel  front desk employers and even a manager  When I mentioned some issues to the manager she said  quot oh sorry quot   but never offered any compensation whatsoever  not even a comment card  I had to ask for one and then was pointed to where I could find it  All in all  I would not recommend this hotel room  especially not a manor room to anyone  not to sure what the Tower  the main building  rooms had to offer  
N =>  Not the family friendly place it makes out to be We decided to stay at the circus circus hotel as we have a   mth old infant  Afterall they do advertise as a family friendly hotel  After queuing for over an hour to check in we eventually got to our rooms which didnt even have a fridge  In    plus heat with an infant the least you would expect in your hotel room is a fridge    The net curtains were badly stained and the beds felt like they had no mattresses on them  We stayed here as part of a self organised tour of the west coast and nevada and I have to say it was the worst hotel we ve ever stayed in  We then had to queue again  for over   mins  to check out as the  quot express checkout quot  facility on the TV was not available  I really would not reccommend this hotel to ANYONE travelling to Las Vegas  It is badly in need of updating  There are too many other Faboulous places to stay for little or no extra  
N =>  Clean spacious great for budget travellers  This was my first trip to Las Vegas and after reading all the awful reviews on this hotel I was really not looking forward to my stay at Circus Circus  I stayed at the Manor Motor Lodge as it was the only one with vacancy during the NAB convention  The room was very clean  no weird smells  no weird stains  Being able to park in front of my room in a well lit parking lot was very convenient  I would say upper scale MOTEL quality is the best way to describe this place  The clown channel on tv was rather freakish but I ve seen worse  As long as you re not expecting golden toilets and silk towels  this hotel motel is OK  
N =>  Vegas      I had the pleasure of visiting Las Vegas again this year  but this time  I stayed at Circus Circus  I stayed in one of the Manor Rooms  which was quite a distance from the main casino  my mother was not pleased  she has trouble walking long distances   Since it was late when I checked in  I had to wait until the next morning  I went to the front desk and asked if there was another room available in one of the Towers  The only room they had was a smoking room  we don t smoke   but you couldn t tell that it was a smoking room  Once we moved into our new room the stay was very very enjoyable  I even strolled the Midway  I felt like a kid again  Even though it was a long way from the newer hotel casinos  the trolley was available  We also visited The Orleans  my mother and my sister said they had come home to roost  Circus Circus is a great place  especially if you have children  I would stay there again  I plan to visit Vegas annually  
N =>   Vegas is a rip My hubby  amp  I just returned from a convention in Las Vegas staying at Circus Circus  Our room was on the   th floor of the skytower  It was neat and clean  had fresh towels each day  and quiet  We were pleased with our room and service  The only thing I didn t like was the fact we had no coffee maker in our room  Had to go downstairs from the   th floor to the Krispy Kreme shop each morning  Took about       minutes to get down and back  But Las Vegas in general is another story  What a rip  Talk about expensive  This town used to be reasonable  Not any more  Hardly any free drinks  They cut down on the cocktail waitresses coming around the slot machines  takes about an hour till they come around again  because they want you to go up to the bars and buy your drinks  No cash coming out the machines  you get vouchers to cash in  No more using the coins that come out the machines  they want you to keep digging in your wallet  No coffee makers in rooms like I previously mentioned  We sat down at the bar at New York New York for a drink and the barmaid said we won t get free drinks until we put     in the machines at the bar  We drank our    mix drinks and left  The coaster atop New York New York is        to ride one time         for all day  It s hard to find a bus at night  Sat for almost   hour one evening when it was cold and windy  The Blue Iguana restaurant inside Circus Circus is closed   nights a week due to cutting labor  C mon it s Vegas  Restaurants shouldn t close  It s not that there isn t enough of customers  Even Hoover Dam now charges  Five bucks to park and     for the boring tour  I ve seen all of Hoover Dam I m gonna see  We had a great time but it s way too expensive for my wallet  Vegas has seen the last of me for a very long time  
N => What a dump We stayed in   hotels over Xmas and this one was the worst    Would not stay there again  way better across the street to the Riveria  I called them from the tourist office in Prim  paid     and got this crap hole  Stay away at all cost       
N =>  YUCK  This place was such a horrible dump  It smelled old  smoky and like urine  there were very questionable people there and when we were trying to check in we had to park on a high level and walk down through grafitti ridden staircases because the elevator did not work  I wouldn t let my family sit on anything and we demanded our prepaid  st night back as we refused to stay even one minute in such a     heap of a motel  I am not even mentioning the surly women in the parking area  We had just stayed in a wonderful hotel in Anaheim  this was a real shock  Don t stay here  
N =>  Not as bad as made out to be by previous reviewers     We just got back from Las Vegas today    The manor rooms were certainly more than adequate They were older but very clean The manor rooms have parking right outside which was very convenient There is a small dorm size frig which is great for keeping milk or sodas in or formula if you have a baby The room was very inexpensive low     s for   adults   kids If you don t like or have children then Circus Circus isn t the place for you Another hotel would probably better meet your needs The circus acts are a bit short but my    yo daughter liked them The Adventure Dome was fun and an ok deal using the coupon book provided   check in It was about     for my daughter and I to get the unlimited rides pass I am    yo but even I had a good time laughing w my daughter The pool was crowded but in      weather what pool wouldn t be crowded We didn t eat in any of the hotel except for in the Adventure Dome and then only snacks Overall Circuc Circus is an enjoyable place to go if you re going on a FAMILY vacation  
N =>  DUMP  Circus Circus is a dump  The walls are paper thin  Even though we were in a non smoking room  we could smell smoke  The cleaning staff was noisy  Way too many kids  If you want to take your kids on vacation  go to Disney World  I ll never stay here again  
N => Better than expected Fun We were pleased with Circus Circus and the manor room was better than we expected  Room was clean  not too large but decent  The property is certainly older but well presented and the rate was a bargain  Noise isolation from room to room seemed very good  It was a plus to be able to park so close to the room as well  The kids enjoyed the midway acts and games  not bad if you be sure to use the Fun Books  The Adventure Dome and rides looked great although we did not wind up using it  The Westside Deli offers jumbo hotdogs  huge Donuts and a massive Stawberry Shortcake for just       each The north strip location is a bit remote  better if you have a car here Our only gripes were the much too plump pillows  bring your own and the pool closing at      PM  Absurd to throw out the guests from the pool when still blazing hot All in all  we feel we did well at Circus Circus   
N =>  Good value espcially if you re driving your car My boyfriend and I stayed here in the summer or       I know  I m late with this review   It was a great Vegas room  The room was large  quiet and clean  Because of the Motor Lodge set up  we easily parked in front of our entrance  We didn t have to deal with walking through the casino or the large hotel to get to the room  it was only seconds from the car to the room  It s also easy to drive to from the strip  Because it s Vegas  we weren t in our room much at all  This was the perfect place to crash  I ve stayed at the MGM Grand before and liked the CC Motor Lodge much better  It s more practical if you re out and about exploring Sin City  
N => Worst Hotel I Have Ever Stayed The front desk was highly unprofessional  very rude and non accomodating  To top it off  we are now disputing unauthorized credit card charges as we are being falsely accused of property damage to a room  MY ADVICE  DO NOT STAY HERE 
N =>   What A Joke For A Hotel The hotel itself was very outdated  smelled very bad  was probably the worst hotel i ve ever been too  I stayed there thinking it was decent  but i was wrong  There was no difference between a frat house and this hotel  If you want to sleep quitely and comfortable  dont stay here  
N =>  Not a good place to hold a seminar Was here for a seminar but the meeting room was absolutely freezing cold  The maintenance person made some attempts to alter the thermostat but was unsuccessful  Beware if you re bringing your family to this property    a  quot gentleman s club quot  is right next door and adult magazine racks are on the sidewalk in front of hotel  Carpets are old  stained  wrinkly and stretched  Staff seems to care less about customer concerns  Property looks very worn and dated  Safety may be a concern    there are some shady characters wandering around near the hotel property  Would not recommend this facility to anybody  
N => Believe the negative reviews    Stayed at this dump from ch   th to ch   th on a baseball trip  I had read the reviews and was a little concerned before we got there but didn t think it would be as bad as other people were saying   gt  gt   gt  gt  First off  we arrived at     pm and tried to check in  They told us we could not check in because it wasn t      yet  They told us that they could give us   room to hold our teams bags in and then when we come back the rest of the rooms would be ready  Not a big deal but from what we saw  there were no cleaning ladies cleaning the rooms in our section and there was a bag of garbage sitting in the hallway  We dumped our stuff off in the one room and went out to get lunch  When we returned  they said our rooms were available and we could now check in  Bag of garbage was still in the hallway and nothing seemed different from the hour earlier when we tried to get in   gt  gt   gt  gt  The rooms were DIRTY  I mean  stains all over the carpet as well as hair in the sink and on the counter  Not a good sign   gt  gt   gt  gt  The area is very unsafe  Our second day there  we saw a cop come flying into the parking lot  jump out of his car with his shot gun  yes  I mean shot guy  Not his little gun on his hip  Next thing    other cop cars came flying in the other side and they all jumped out with their guns drawn  I guess they ended up trapping some guy around the back of the hotel who also had a gun  Such a nice feeling when you are trying to look after    kids  gt  gt   gt  gt  The next day  a car drove by me right in front of the lobby and offered to sell me drugs  Another nice thing for the kids to be around   gt  gt   gt  gt  We needed to get another room because   of us coaches weren t going to fit into one room together  We went to the lobby and requested another room  They said  quot no problem but we can t give you the same room rate quot   I asked why  to which they replied  because all    rooms we had reserved were booked  Funny  we only were using   rooms  Anyways  she put up a fight with us and answered   different phone calls while we were trying to figure this out  In the end  we got another room at the same rate  but the attitude and help we got was brutal   gt  gt   gt  gt  I believe I asked to talk to a manager on   different occasions and the person behind the front counter told me that there was none there at the time  Again  kinda funny because these were at all different times of the day and she could talk to the manager on the phone  but couldn t seem to get her to come to the front counter   gt  gt   gt  gt  Upon check out  we quickly paid our tab on   rooms for   nights and headed out to catch our flight  As we ate breakfast  at Terribles   very good I might add  we looked over one of the rooms invoices they had given us  This was the room of one of the coaches  He had been charged     in phone charges     total phone calls all from the Friday night  which we weren t in the room to make  We called the hotel to ask for help with this and the girl at the counter put us on hold  After a few minutes and nobody coming back to the phone  we drove back to the hotel  When we walked into the lobby  still on hold I might add  the girl was talking to someone else on the phone and not even dealing with our situation  We approached her and she gave us no explanation as to why the charges were there and that once again  no manager was on duty to help us  She then answered   phone calls right in the middle of us talking to her   gt  gt   gt  gt  Another couple lined up behind us and within minutes  she completely walked away and started to help them  Unbelievable   gt  gt   gt  gt  Never in my life have I witnessed such horrible treatment by staff   in any form of customer service  These people behind the counter didn t care one bit about the people spending money at this hotel  Never in my life would I recommend this hotel   not even to my worst enemy   gt  gt   gt  gt  Believe all the negative reports you read on here  If you don t and book here  I promise you will be in shock  Save your money and sleep in a cardboard box on the sidewalk if you have to  just don t stay here  gt  
N =>   Beware    Room was broken into  the first night we arrived  while we were in the room  The  quot Electronic Key  and  Deadbolt  were compromised  Management told us  quot there was nothing they could do quot  and that  quot it was not their problem  quot  When I checked out they added bogus charges to the bill  Once again  management told me that there was nothing they could do  Stay away from this place  
N =>   Oh My God    We actually booked here because of a conference that was being held at the Clarion Where to start well first off  the pictures on the web are TOTALLY false  except for the fountain in the center of the FREEZING COLD pool  That was pretty  The so called limo was no were to be found  We received a luxury ride in an Econo line Van  Very impressive  The room was dirty upon arrival  Hair on the counter top  Food crumbs on the floor etc  The first night   midnight exactly the phone started buzzing and message light flashing  Lady at desk said they would fix it but never did  We finally just unplugged it  The beds were HORRIBLE  They both bowed in the middle  The Television quality and reception was lousy  The exercise facility was gross  it smelled like a nasty arm pit with dirty towels on the floor  The  hot tub  was cold and taped off  out of order for two out of the three days that we were there  Then the day we were leaving it was opened with leaves  twigs and sand on the bottom  Go figure  To top this all off  as we were packing up to finally leave  checking everywhere to make sure we don t leave anything behind  we found drugs and drug paraphernalia behind the second bed  Went down to talk to the manager and they wouldn t even come talk to us  The girl at the counter just apologized and said they would talk to house keeping  WHAT EVER  
N =>   Crazy To Stay Here     Don t believe anything they have in writing  bathroom was filthy  enamel on sink chipping  lucky if you have condiments for coffee in room  cook didn t show up for breakfast no substitue therefore no breakfast available  restaurant open until      pm but they quit cooking at      pm  you can probably get one of the bartenders to fix you a salad if you are there before      pm don t look for a night cap because they close at      pm  fire alarm goes off for no reason  no hot water because the maintenance man didn t want to come in early to restart them after the city had water shut off during night  desk clerk couldn t figure out how to make change from cash deposit left  
N => Horrible Where to start  I booked this hotel  because it was near the airport and had free internet  to do online check in   We were only staying the night before our flights out the next day  We have been to Vegas a dozen times in the last   years  so we didn t really want to be on the strip  due to traffic and such We arrived early  before check in  and they kindly let us check in  The exterior of the hotel made me nervous  it was very old  weathered  just plain run down  I was willing to overlook it  I was only paying       When we got in they were in remodeling  everything was torn apart  But we thought OK  we will get to our room and maybe it will be better  not so loud and dirty Ohh  but it only got worse  The shag carper had so many unidentifiable stains  It was like a crime scene  I didn t remove my shoes  My husband went to the front to ask to change rooms   Our friends a room that had clean carpet  As we walked to the front desk  we felt we were in the ghetto  The parking lot was filled with thugs   and no  they were not workers  just loiterers  Understand  I have traveled to world  Been in great and not so great hotels  Had to have armed guards  But  my husband said that he would leave the luggage on the car  because at least it had an alarm  He thought the room would be robbed We told them our problems and they kindly let us check out without being charged  We went directly to the Treasure Island  our favorite Vegas hotel  and for     more had a beautiful  clean  pleasant stay  It was     well spent I stay at Choice Hotels  Clarion Inn  Quality Inn  Comfort Inn  all over the world  Belong to Choice Privilege club  even have there credit card  But even a loyal customer like me  had to leave this disaster of a hotel  
N =>   BATES Motel  This is the worst place to stay  we had a terrible time there  There was urine in the elevator  The key cards kept getting deactivated  Some of the family members had the no somking section and that was really bad  It had a really foul oder in the halls and the rooms  There was toe nail clipping in the bed  Once they cleaned the bed it was all over the floor  The shuttle service was lousey  It s two long blocks from the strip  Half the staff did not speak english  This place blows                    
N =>   Stay away from this dump  Las Vegas s Best Keep Secret      Yeah Right We had made a booking for   rooms for   nites each  But they had only   room booked for us and waited   hours before we got our second room  Very poor staff as they could not care less If this place is the best kept secret in vegas  Vegas is in trouble They must have rated this dump them selfs as no one else would give that heading A very old place with a coat of paint  dirty rooms and our toilet had a big piece broken out of the front of the bowl  I wanted to leave the place when i pulled into the car park but had prepaid the whole amount  We had booked non smoking rooms and yes both our rooms were smoking rooms  Not good enuff  And no other rooms to offer us  POOR POOR POOR   We went to vegas for the NHRA and was lucky i had my buddys with me  as i would not have stayed there with my wife and kids  Looks good in the adds but far from that in the flesh Do your self a favor and go stay somewhere else  
N =>   alright hotel This hotel is alright  Nothing exceptional  nothing horrible  The check in process was slow    It took probably       minutes  The employee did not know what she was doing  so she had to go and get another employee  Room was clean and nicely furnished   I was worried because of some reviews  The pool was cold  but big  The kids loved it though because it has a fountain in the middle of it  The hotel has a shuttle service  The problem with it is that the shuttle will drop you off in a few places  but it will not pick you back up  With small children it creates a huge problem  No continental breakfast  The tv does not have many channels  Bathroom was small  Outside of the bathroom is a little vanity  which was nice  In the room there was a little wet bar with a fridge  Overall the experience was okay  Prices were alright for a weekend night in Vegas  
N =>   Trust Me You Don t Want to Stay Here This is a place you don t want to stay if you have problems  We had a very loud noise that sounded like someone threw silverware done an insinkerator and turned it on  We first heard it in the afternoon but went out to some casinos  We returned at    p m  and we noticed that the noise was going on and off every   min  We called to the front desk about       and they said they would send maintenance up    hours later through an almost sleepless night the noise continued  Apparently the night shift didn t know that the maintenance man went home at    p m  Upon check out I asked for a reduction of our bill because our stay that night did not meet their      satisfaction at all  Basically  they don t care about their guests nor quality of care or guest relations  I had to call Choice Hotels to get compensation  The Clarion did issue an apology but I felt it didn t compensate for a lousy night   their bad attitudes and lack of customer service  I do have to commend one of their van drivers who went out of his way for us and the restaurant staff were very nice  
N =>  The most unfriendly staff ever I stayed at this hotel because it was the recommended hotel for a conference at UNLV  I arrived early    ish  on the first day after traveling across the country to get there  I was told that they would have a room in a couple of hours  so I went to the strip  When I returned in three hours  I was told that I would have to wait until check in at three  Meanwhile  they checked in several other people who were part of the conference  and would not check me in until    Their response was that check in was at    I have never had a hotel that made me wait until the minute check in started  That was a minor detail compared with the rest of the stay We got our room  which was suppose to be a non smoking room  The room smelled worse than any other room I have ever been in  We went to the front desk  which one person said that they would give us a can of deodorizer  Luckily  the only nice person working  Champagne was her name  I think  stepped in and said that she would change our room  The new room was better We stayed for three nights  and the room was only cleaned one time  The day before we left  we asked if we could have late check out and would pay for the extra time  The woman said to come back in the morning and they would extend it for a couple of hours at no charge  The next day  they said that they would extend it for a couple of hours but charge me    dollars  I agreed and then was billed    dollars  which they said was half the price  They didn t seem to care Do not stay at this hotel because it is one of the worst places I have ever stayed  and the staff  except Champagne  was some of the rudest and unaccommodating people I have ever met  For a town based on tourism  you would think that service would be the top priority  Not at this place  
N =>   Avoid it at all cost       We were stranded in Las Vegas due to flight cancellations because of bad weather to our destination  On that Friday evening  there were only few options and ended up landing at the Clarion  We thought it was going to be all right  however  we were totally wrong  Even though we booked a pricey        night  for a non smoking room  the hotel didn t honor the request and gave us a smoking room  The common areas of the hotel are disgusting  dust and dirt everywhere  Our room  located on the third floor  was even worse  The comforters were stained and dirty  all pieces of furniture were nicked and scratched  The old and smelly carpet was totally filthy and soiled  I believe they hadn t steamed or cleaned the carpets in ages  On top of everything  our room was located next to the entrance of the floor and each time people opened the door it slammed  over and over again  Staff were not supportive  poor service  In conclusion  it was a nightmare  Trust me  you do not want to stay at the Clarion  
N =>  Horrible Waste Of Money And Scary Place We arrived late  so NO time to find another hotel  We walked in to check in and could not understand the rep there as he spoke very little English Our room was AWFUL  I noticed it was just painted  There were paint spots all over  That was NOT the problem  Appears they tried to patch bullet holes in the walls  I found blood on the door and the side of the tv cabinet  The couple of towels they left us were yellow stained and used  The two person jetted tub was plastic and smelled with stains  No bath mat  The bed was horrible  We lifted the sheets to find huge soaked stains  The couch had stains all over it  We felt very uneasy in the room  We called for a change of rooms  We were given the room right below us  That one also just painted   To cover up what leaked from the upstairs room   The towels were also just as gross  The carpet was totally stained with large oil  dirt  etc stains  Everything smelled  We spent      on this     It was the worst night of our vacation which included rustic cabins in Death Valley  They were     times better than this place I would tell everyone NOT to go here  Also a safety issue as the locks on the door had been knocked off  The wood was broke on the door jam  The area is very scary  Do NOT walk anywhere around this place  The limo they have on their web site was who knows where     Very unfriendly people Even their wi fi did not work properly WHATEVER you do  don t book here     You will be staying in a germ infested  very scary place  I think it should be condemned by the health department  Come on  We will NEVER stay at another Clarion since they put their name on this hotel  We left EARLY I would add pictures of what we found  but it would gross all of you out  
N =>  Poor management  Poor service  Terrible stay  STAY AWAY   We were scheduled to stay at this hotel for three nights  but ended up leaving after the first two due to problems that we saw with every aspect of the hotel MANAGEMENT  We saw one of the managers  male  acting like a child  running around and flirting with one of the front desk clerks while the other desk clerk  who appeared to be training  dealt with customers  Another manager  Kelly  is extremely rude to guests and treats her staff very poorly  She gave our family unnecessary attitude about something that should have been an easy fix  just because she did not feel like doing her job of providing acceptable customer service  We witnessed her rolling her eyes and repremanding the staff right at the front desk  It is hard to run a good hotel if you have two immature lazy children for a mangement team  Considering how horrible this hotel is  one would think that the managers would be trying to improve  Extremely unprofessional behavior  FRONT DESK  For the most part the clerks at the desk tried their best to provide good customer service  There were a couple females who were questionable  but it seemed as though that was a result of poor training  We had to wait a couple of times for the girl to get off her cell phone to acknowledge us HOUSEKEEPING  Didn t have enough towels in the room  The towels that we did have had stains all over them and strings falling out of them  This was also the case for the bedding and carpet  which also had stains all over them  Additionally the housekeepers do not speak English which obviously makes communication more difficult  Also  the room smelled HORRIBLERESTAURANT  The servers were rude  Either they were on their cell phones with their backs to us  or not making eye contact with us as to not serve us  We overheard them complaining about customers who do not give tips  Some words were used that should never be used in a public   quot professional quot  setting WE WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND WILL ADVISE ALL OTHERS TO DO THE SAME   
N => Just Okay for a short stay We stayed at the Clarion Saturday e   th  We got into Las Vegas late after a long plane ride so we didn t want to spend a lot for a hotel  I think we got a rate of around          through Expedia  If you are looking to save money on a weekend night when rates go up on the nicer hotels this is okay  I don t know if I would want to stay here any more than a night or so  When we arrived to our hotel it was late and we were tired  Check in went smoothly  We got into our room and the air was not working  It was extreamly hot    We called the front desk and they sent maintenance right away to our room  They were able to fix it after a while  That was nice  The room itself looked worn it needs some updating  It was loud during the night you could hear doors slamming  One of our towels in the bathroom had an old stain on it   Yuck   It was several blocks down to the Strip but I m told there was a limo we could have taken  The area did not seem bad there were some other casino s nearby and several chain restaurants nearby  Cozymels  Buca di Beppo to name a couple  However there was a gentleman s club next door I would say this place is just okay  It wasn t horrible or the wost place I have stayed  I wasn t expecting a four star hotel at the rate I received  This would be a good place for people who mainly want to save some money and won t be in the room much  Also those who prefer not to stay right in a casino hotel  
N =>  Friendly Staff  I stayed at this hotel in the end of ch  I was a bit worried  after seeing some of the reviews  but was pleasently surprised  When I landed at the airport  I was worried because check in time was  PM  and my flight got mer there at    AM  I called the from the airport on the courtsy phone  the lady was pleasent  and helpful  and said the  quot limo quot  would be there in    minutes  Just enough time tio get my bags and walk out on the lower level  I was asked if I was Mr  xyz  I said yes  he took my bag and away we went It was a limo  large cool  and comfortable  Its a free service  but I tipped him    The staff at the front desk was helpfull  the lobby while somewhat dated  was clean  with the fountain running  My only problem was when I walked into the room  there was a smell I couldnt identify  But realized the windows were open  and the  quot smell quot  was Las Vegas quot  After some tiome with the AC on  it seemed to be gone My second day there I decided for breakfast in the hotel  GREAT waitress  from Minnesota  food was hot and good portion  at a resonable cost  Nothing to write home about  but no worse than a Perkins or Dennys  Plus it only cost    for steak  eggs  and beverage All in all I found the staff helpfull  the hotel ok  The workout equipment is way out datetd  I think they would have been better off keeping a bar in the room they converted to a  quot fitness center quot  Its a walk to the strip  but I enjoyed walking faster than the cars seemingly always stuck in a traffic jam All in all OK gt  You dont go to Vegas for the hotel  your hotel is to sleep and get clean  and it searved its purpose above and beyond  
N =>  We Loved this place  Ignore the bad reviews  Great off the strip hotel  Now don t get me wrong  this is not the Bellagio  but it is decent for a Clarion  I travel a TON for business  As a matter of fact  I flew    girls to Vegas on frequent flier miles I had accumulated from all my travel over the past year  I stay in hotels just as frequently  This hotel passed my inspection with flying colors It had a very clean pool area  which we frequented  The rooms were also decently clean  Our air conditioning worked WONDERFULLY  it was     degrees one day we were there    We even had to turn in down occasionally  The bathroom was clean and had great water pressure in the shower  The small restaurant had VERY good food which honestly surprised me  I had breakfasts and appitizers   Several of my friends also had lunch and said it was quite good  Our service was quite good  The service at the bar and front desk was fine  We even had one worker who would go out of his way to help us and check to make sure our stay was going smoothly  The free limo was a great extra  We took it to the strip and to and from the airport  We used its service service to get to the strip and usually took a cab home  This hotel is walking distance to the strip  however it was so hot when we were there  we took the limo  Then we would catch a cab back to the hotel  which cost around    with   to   girls in the cab  Don t expect elegance and glitter at this joint  But if you want a decent  off the strip place to stay this passed my inspection  I am even considering staying here on my honeymoon as I have some hotel points I need to use up  
N =>   Cool Hotel i dont know what everyones talking about but the clarion was nice to me when we checked in the lady was really helpful then we got to our room i thought it was cool it had a sofa a fridge quiet and off the strip so u can kick back u can park ur car where u can see it i d stay there again cuz its clean and not expensive and its off the strip 
N => Filthy AND the most horrible service We thought that we were being filmed for a Candid Camera episode The place  beyond the lobby  was absolutely filthy and service to match If you plan on complaining  please don t see  quot Ike quot   General Manger   He sees and hears no evil but he certainly does speak it With all of the choices Vegas has to offer please don t even consider this property  The only reason we had our meeting there was because it was a last minute plan and there were no other options available  Had we known it was as bad as it was we would have rescheduled  
N =>  Awful  The only good thing about this hotel  is that it s right down from the strip and they do have limo service to and from the strip To start off  the girl at the front desk had really long fingernails that were painted GREEN  Not a very professional look Our room was filthy  The carpet was stained  and the room reeked of smoke   even though it was a nonsmoking room  I could hear the people above us  walking  stomping  around the entire time  Of course  due to the proximity of the strip   we could hear people in the hallway  all night long I will never stay here again  Neither should anyone else  
N =>  worst worst and the worst WORST HOTEL in the world  The general manager yelled at me when I clamied him that we had bad service during our stay  Room was dirty  other guest tried to get into one of our room in the middle of night  When I told him that one of our room was dirty  he replied to me   quot oh  yeah  I don t know who did it  be someone got inside quot  Someone might be get inside    What a response  It s getting worse  He yelled at me saying   quot I heard enough  I don t have time to play with you  what do you want  what do you want   quot  That is the attitude of the general manager  Most of theri staff were very similar with him  No one admits anything but accuses customer instead  After I clamied the Clarion Hotel  he sent me a letter with no apology but this   quot I apologize if we did not meet your standards  We are a Three Diamond AAA property quot  If you don t believe me  just try to stay there  You will see  
N =>   Had a Great Time  Just wanted to say that we have just returned from a   week stay at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon    we had a great time  The   bedroom appartment was great  perhaps a little tired in places  but it was very clean  air conditioning was working the whole time of our stay  A dead battery in the smoke detector which was pinging was replaced the same day  Swimming pool was great as this could be used from      am till Midnight which was marvellous as the temperature was still in the    s late at night  It was close to several supermarkets  amp  eateries  It is about a       minute easy drive to the strip with free parking at all of the major hotels  While there  we travelled to the Grand Canyon  Death Valley  Hoover Dam  amp  Red Rock Canyon  An Excellent holiday had by all  
N =>  Dont stay here They have a new policy that when you leave your unit  the air conditioner shuts off  In the summer this is not good  We returned hours later to a stifling hot room of    degrees  which then took hours to cool  Dated furniture  small beds  no music by pool     this place is not very accommodating  Shop elsewhere  
N =>   Peace at Peace Canyon My   th birthday surprise was a trip to Vegas and a week s stay at The Cliffs  The Cliffs are a bit older and the accommodations are dated  but  if you don t want to stay right on the strip but enjoy the convenience of gas  groceries and food close by  this is a nice place to stay  It doesn t have a lot of amenities to speak of  just a pool  bar b que area and minimal gym  We didn t spend a lot of day time at the Cliffs  We chose to use it mainly for a place to crash at night  Everything was at least adequate  The air conditioning system worked well  nice kitchen and laundry facilities  Well lit walkways and covered parking  All in all  it was a very nice place to stay  Our unit did have these high windows with no covering and it s daylight at      in the morning  We had to stuff pillows in each opening to make the bedroom dark  
N =>   If you want to avoid the Strip enjoy the family this is the spot    My wife    year old and   week old were driving to Las Vegas to see friends from college and have a get together  Being a     day a year traveller  I wanted something that was family friendly  This property was PERFECT  The Cliffs at Peace Canyon  is west of downtown Las Vegas  a comfortable twenty minute drive by car  We stayed in a one bedroom units  over      square feet of combined living space  which was plenty od space  It had a full sized kitchen do we were able to buy some breakfast items and keep them in the fridge  which helped us save some money  We relaxed in the swimming pool and heated spa  worked out in the fitness facility  and they have a huge clubhouse  This property will be our place when we want to stay off the strip  
N =>  Cockroaches at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon stay away    We booked a   night stay through Hotels com  When we checked into our room or condo we immediately noticed cockroaches behind the couch  in the closet and the bedroom  Some were alive  some dead  We instantly complained to the staff and they told us  quot Cockroaches were normal to see in Las Vegas and Florida hotels  quot  I told them we didn t feel we should have to stay here and requested a refund  They told us they would only give us a refund for   night  They also said for us to leave our bags outside when we returned home incase we brought some roaches or eggs with us home  We were very upset and called Hotels com which were absolutely useless  We were getting nowhere fast and still had to find a hotel for that night  Don t let their good reviews fool you and make the same mistake we did  You also won t get a penny back from Hotels com  STAY AWAY FROM THE CLIFFS    Las Vegas  
N =>   Great Value On this trip I traveled with my boyfriend and two friends  We are all in our late    s Before checking into the Cliffs I read many reviews  All in all  I found our experience to be VERY good  and found most of the reviews to be petty and negative  Upon checking in we were greeted nicely and were given the time share talk  however after quickly saying we were not interested we were able to walk away  This was done in UNDER   minutes  They did call us once during the stay to ask if we had been introduced to the time share opportunity and I simply said we weren t interested  NO BIG DEAL  The grounds on the Cliffs property were beautiful and the hot tub was GREAT  We also loved our   bedroom condo unit  While some things were outdated as another guest put it  we had no trouble making the best of everything we were given  We also spent minimal time in our room because we were always out sight seeing or enjoying the pool hot tub  thus at the end of the day we had no complaints  It was wonderful to come back to a cool room with a stocked fridge and a comfortable bed  We also had no trouble with noise outside our room or with other patrons staff  The only issue we had with the Cliffs was the distance from the strip  BUT  we knew this going into it  Thus we can t really complain  The shuttle ran from   am until      pm and two of the drivers were EXCELLENT  The other drive we did not so much care for  but oh well  Because we often stayed out later than      pm it was a hassle and expensive to take cabs back to the cliffs  But  once again we figured this would be the case before we arrived  People also complained about making a reservation for the free shuttle  which was really no big deal  Usually the day before when we made our plans for the following day I called down to the front desk and made our reservation  We only had trouble one time the entire   days we there getting the shuttle we wanted  And even then  we just picked the later one  once again no big deal  I also made and changed many shuttle reservations the same day we were taking them  The staff is willing to be flexible for you if you are patient and friendly to them  In the end we LOVED the Cliffs  The only reason we would choose not to stay there is the distance it is to the strip  
N =>   Not what we expected We traded our timeshare through RCI  I guess I am spoiled with our home based timeshare in Orlando Florida  where there are so many more ammenities than the Cliffs  I would only recommend the Cliffs for single couples   newlyweds or older couples that want to relax the whole time in their unit  I am relieved that we didn t bring our children  otherwise it would have been a very loooong vacation  There was absoutly nothing for guests to participate in besides the pool  amp  hottub  Although there was a pool table on site  if you play pool  I was very dissapointed that a     fee was assessed if internet was requested in your unit  Even Super   hotels give free internet   We also received a sales call from a bank asking to lower our credit card interest rate  How did they get our individual unit     Although the unit was very clean and supplied with everything you needed for the week and the decor was lovely  the layout of the unit was questionable  Why would you have such a large closet in each unit  I would have used this space to maybe enlarge the bedroom for a king size bed  I am sorry to say that I would not stay at the Cliffs again  
N =>  Another unwanted Time Share Presentation On our first stay at The Cliffs we found that it is quiet  away from the strip and comfortable  On our second stay we found the same peace and quiet  However  we made the mistake of asking if discounted tickets to shows were available to RCI members  We told discounted tickets were available by attended a breakfast meeting  We made it very clear that we did not want to listen to another sales presentation  We were assured no sales presentation would be involved  but we did have to attend the breakfast meeting to be offered discounted tickets  Guess what  We had to say no at the end of another sales presentation and wasted   hours of a commissioned salesman s time  When we returned to The Cliffs we were asked to pay        for a         show tickets and forgo the      cash for attending the breakfast meeting  If we took the      we could not have the discounted tickets  Talk about misrepresentation and double talk  Be prepared to attend the same breakfast meeting  everyone is asked to attend  Oh yes  on our last stay  free high speed wireless Internet was available from a few rooms and around the pool area  Now everyone is being asked to pay        a week for the upgraded service that is now available in all rooms  Apparently  they will stop charging when guests have paid for the upgrade  In our home timeshare  the owners would have paid for this upgrade  not the guests who trade their time  All in all you will enjoy your stay  just remember that you will be asked to attend a breakfast meeting  
N =>   Our home away from home This was not our first trip to Vegas  but our first at the Cliffs  We had a fabulous stay  and highly recommend to anyone  Our apartment was spacious clean and quiet  It had everything we needed and more  The shuttle service to the strip was fantastic and a huge credit goes out to  quot Steve quot  our shuttle driver  He provided us with great local knowledge and a huge amount of humour along the way Thankyou to all staff at The Cliffs for making our stay the best it could be  We look forward to our next stay at the Cliffs 
N =>  Dishonest Employees We were very disappointed to have found out that we left my husband s favorite jacket in the hall closet of the unit where we hung it when we arrived  Realizing we left it there  we immediately called as soon as we got home  They said no jacket was found  We can t believe someone took interest in it  One of the employees who went in the room after we checked out stole the jacket  It was a nice Harley Davidson jacket This is not the first time we left something in hotel rooms  but they were always returned  They have a thief working in this property  How can you trust your valuables when you leave your room  
N =>   Fantastic   The Cliffs at Peace Canyon was the perfect place for   weeks of R amp R   close enough to the strip   miles  but far enough away to not have much traffic  We had a   bdr  bath and while it was just the right amount of space to spread out and feel at home for the two of us  when our grown daughters came for a few days it was a bit tight  We rented a car but they have a free shuttle to the Freemont district and the Bellagio that was nice  If you like some down time they have free movies to check out a pool table and board games were being ordered  The pool is nice but maybe a little on the small side and there is a hot tub  Within walking distance are Target  a grocery store or two and a few places to eat  so a pretty good location for a longer stay  The staff was helpfull and polite and the  quot sales pitch quot   this is a timeshare  was no pressure  We will be going back  
N =>   Loved this place   Wow  I think we were there at the same time as the  quot madmanin utah quot  but we have totally different perspectives  We thought the place was nice and quiet  We also had two children  but we saw other children there  not a lot  but that s OK    too many kids make it very noisy    And our beds were both queen and I didn t notice any fake plants  except maybe one or two way up high on top of our entertainment centers  Another review said the furniture was outdated  we thought ours was just fine  And as for the toilet not flushing  just hold down the handle and count to three and it flushes fine  We loved the location  far enough from the strip in a residential area that was nice and quiet  yet just a    minute drive downtown if you didn t want to take their free shuttle  We were in Vegas for a basketball tournament  so we really loved the washing machine and dryer in our unit  And the full kitchen was great so we didn t have to eat out so much  A grocery store is   minutes away  The only downside to the stay was that the individual rooms don t have wireless internet access  but the pool reception area does We loved it and would definitely go back if we go to Vegas again  
N =>  Quiet Refuge We recently spent a week at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon as a gift from our parents  timeshare swap   Most complaints  in other reviews  seem to stem from the decor being outdated  It has been our experience that timeshare resorts take a little longer to update decor because they have to invest income from owner dues and sales  That said  we found this property to be in excellent shape  the unit we stayed in was extremely clean  and comfortable  The property was well maintained and the service was responsive and pleasant  We spent signifgant time at the pool and found it very comfortable clean as well  This is not a large resort  and is away from the frenetic energy of the strip  which is just what we wanted  They have a very active shuttle system  and many services and restaurants are close by  I would have no problem coming back to this property in the future  
N =>  Great Place to Stay We stayed at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon from      to          The stay was wonderful  We had some minor problems which were dealt with immediately and corrected  The unit is about a    minute ride from Las Vegas Blvd  straight up Tropicana Street  The unit was roomy and clean  I would not hesitate to recommend the unit and we plan to go back next year  
N =>  a positive experience The Cliffs was a positive experience  The unit was nicely decorated  There were   couples  so the bedrooms and bathrooms being on separate ends of the kitchen and living room were a big plus  The gas fireplace added a nice touch The staff was extremely helpful  It was also great to have access to the strip using the convenient shuttle  all of the drivers of the shuttle were knowledgeble and willing to volunteer information  Typically  they picked up and delivered to the Belagio  but didn t mind dropping you off other places as needed  The clubhouse area was available for internet  lounging by the fireplace  playing pool  or just relaxing with a cup of coffee  As soon as we got to the unit we noticed a puddle of water in the bathroom  We called the Front Desk  and within   minutes there was someone there  We went to dinner and by the time we got back it was fixed I recommend renting a car if you want to see some sights  We went to Hoover Dam  Valley of Fire  and Red Rock Canyon  Red Rock Casino also had movie theaters  bowling  and several eating establishments on site The neighborhood it s located in was a new and booming area  Grocery stores  Walt  Target  and restaurants such as Famous Dave s and Joe s Crabshack were a close drive  If you stay here  you may want to request a unit away from the main road  Our bedroom was next to the street  so it was a little noisy  Again  it was a positive experience  
N =>   Pretty good  The Cliffs at Peace Canyon was a good place to stay  not too bad  not too luxurious   pretty much a valuable traveling experience  Me and my parents had stayed there with my grandmother and my cousin  Checking in was pleasant and quick with good service  I remember pool tables in the lobby and granite stairsteps  moderate sized room with great cable television and lots of furniture  there s not much to say about the interior   but it was not too far from town squares and shopping centers  I think this was an excellent place to stay  but not too good for those who prefer wide open rooms  
N =>  Peaceful Stay at the Cliffs Just got back from my   th birthday trip to Las Vegas  My girlfriends and I did a timeshare exchange and stayed at The Cliffs at Peace Canyon and had a great time  I was a little worried b c we were some of the youngest people there that week but the other guests as well as the staff were so friendly  The condo itself was very nicely decorated and clean as well as spacious  The grounds are well kept and although the pool waterfall is not a glamorous as it looks on their website  it s still nice   I opted not to rent a car which turned out to be perfect b c they have a shuttle that takes you to the strip every hour  It ends at     am so a couple of nights we got a cab back to the condo which wasn t bad at all  This was everybody s  st trip to Vegas and we loved the fact that we were not staying on the strip  The condos are peaceful and there are shops food within walking distance I highly recommend this place if you don t want to be on the strip and I look forward to my next Vegas trip at The Cliffs  
N =>   Great Place   Great Location This was the best timeshare property I have ever seen  My experience with time shares are usually pretty run down  crowded  places  We had a beautiful   bedroom condo  very clean  Pool was nice  exercise room  pool table and    hour internet available  Washer and dryer in condo was a treat  Location was great  took about    minutes to get to strip  lots of stores around  Target  Walmart  etc   I would recommend this place to the timeshare reluctant  
N =>   Wonderful resort Our family stayed here in y      during very hot weather  The resort was wonderful  the staff very helpful  and the unit very comfortable  Initial fears of having trouble booking rides on the shuttle proved to be very wrong  We had no trouble booking our shuttle times to and from the strip  The drivers were great and always on time  Sal  the guest services hostess  did a wonderful presentation on where to go  what to see  where to eat and  quot how to gamble the slots quot  while in Vegas so that we could make the best use of our time  Although we didn t initially intend to attend her talk I am sooooo glad we did  It was very informative for first time Vegas visitors  The Cliffs was a wonderful place to relax and get away from the bustle of the strip  It is well kept and quiet  I would recommend this resort for anyone who likes to have a quiet restful place  quot to come home to quot   
N =>   Great Stay at the Cliffs The Cliffs was a great place to stay to be close enough to the Vegas action  but far enough away to get a good night s sleep A few of the young ladies at the front desk left much to be desired but other than that everyone else was good One good thing about the Cliffs is that they have DVD s available for free rental should you have an downtime in Vegas  Be sure to return them by the due date or else you will paying quite a bit for them even if yuo do return them They also have computers with internet access that you can use free of charge  They are a little older models so don t expect to be able to charge your IPOD on them The rooms were nice and met my expectations  The pictures posted on this site and other sites  Expedia  Orbitz etc  are consistent with what you can expect  Please note though that the pool area is smaller than it appears If you are debating between renting a car and not renting a car  I advise that you do rent a car so that you are able to enjoy some of the farther attractions without having to pay to go on tours   example  Ethel M Factory  Red Canyon  Outlet Malls  Hoover Dam  
N =>   good place to stay off strip If you want to stay off strip this is a good apartment South west of las vegas  Free shuttle to the Belagio hotel every hour  mid morning until early hours Very good staff  pool area  four internet points luxury apartments  quiet area  
N =>   Very Pleasant Experience Apartment was very clean and well appointed  Staff extremely helpful   amp  courteous  A couple of minor problems were attended to immediately and with a smile  Directions and recommendations for shopping  sights to see   amp  resturants were spot on  Free computer room for guests offering hi speed internet w printer a definite plus  Location was excellent   close enough to get downtown rapidly  but far enough away for quiet relaxation  Full size washer  amp  dryer in unit another plus  
N =>  Not a haven for the Non Smoker allergy prone On first glance  the resort  room had everything we needed for our family of four   two bedrooms bathrooms  TVs in every room  large screen in living room   typical time share full kitchen  pool  internet access  An added bonus was the full sized washer and dryer  But    if you want to feel like you were living in an ashtray for the duration of your stay  maybe ok if you are a smoker  or do not have a sense of smell  you will enjoy your stay  Unfortunately  we took the  quot all non smoking rooms policy quot  of the resort seriously and thought we would have a reprieve from the smoke that pervades Las Vegas  It was not the smell of just one person staying in the room before us  it was embedded in everything  including the air conditioner  The management did send someone to change the filter in the room  but it didn t do anything  It was so very disappointing we couldn t wait to get home  
N =>  Amazing courteous wonderful  When my fiance  amp  I were planning our Vegas wedding we didn t want to stay on the  quot strip quot  but were hesitant as to where to stay  I found this hotel on Expedia  amp  booked the package with them  I called my parents who live in Phoenix  amp  because of health concerns could only drive to Vegas hence our  quot Vegas quot  wedding  My mom booked thru Hotels as did our friends  amp  when I called to verify our reservations I talked to Danny  I immediately felt so comfortable with him as he did everything to get all of our friends in the same building or area  We were all within shouting distance of each other  amp  the site is GORGEOUS  The pool was beautiful  amp  so were the condo s  We got married on the   th  amp  decided since there were gas barbeques     on site that we would have a casual reception  Unfortunately the wind kicked up and it was very cold  My sister went to the office and asked what we could do  amp  they went so far above  amp  beyond it was amazing  They reserved the main room with the big screen TV  they guys got to see the football game   amp  fireplace  amp  bar for us  amp  we had it until    pm all to ourselves  We fed the whole crew that was working  amp  the security guard left nothing to chance  amp  made sure that the barbeques were working and that we had enough utensils etc  The person that wrote the horrible review must have stayed at a different place  I have been to many   star accomodations  amp  I would take this over all of them  Thank you Danny  Lisa  amp  crew for your wonderful hospitality  amp  attention to all the important details that made my reception more than I could have hoped it would be ie Haskins    
N => Nice amenities but not all we expected When checking in   it is very obvious that this resort was originally built as apartments which have been converted to timeshare  The quality of workmanship is very poor  sounds between apartments easily heard   etc  Our first apartment had a broken shower door  just standing in the bathroom  and an extremely uncomfortable sofa bed  We were then moved to an apartment on a busy road which was awful  The next day  we were taken care of and moved to an apartment with closer proximity to the pool which was much nicer but still not of the quality of other similiar resorts  The sofa beds  overall  are inadquate and really not of high enough standard for somebody to sleep on for a week  Other resorts we have stayed in   the sofa bed has been almost as good as the permanent beds  With a larger party   it is important that the sofa beds do not leave the people sleeping on them with back problems  Pro  Very nice landscaping pool  Apartments spacious and clean but not of same quality as other rated resorts  Con  Sound proofing bad  Some staff very good  others very unfriendly  Gym inadequate   poor selection of weights  and just a couple of treadmills bikes  They should have at least one eliptical machine    would be better   They have provided much more space to those selling the timeshares than for those wanting to exercise while on vacation  The worst   which I say to all of these timeshare resorts   is please catch up with the times and provide decent internet services  The tiny  overheated internet room in the main building was constantly full and very uncomfortable to work in  At the very least   they should provide a wireless network for the main building so people can sit comfortably but it wouldn t be that difficult to provide fast internet directly to the rooms  or wireless  even at a cost so people can be with their friends families even if they do need to do some work on vacation  This is something that needs to be addressed by all RCI resorts AND QUICKLY  
N => We Loved it   We had a second honeymoon and decided to go here as neither of us had ever been to vegas  We rented this   bedroom condo and were astonished at how beautiful it was  It was huge  like an apartment  Everything was perfect  Yes  the beds were a little hard  but nothing we couldn t handle  The condo was located about       minutes from the strip  which was perfect for us  Didn t have all that noise from the strip  yet  close enough to be there in minutes at any time  I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a beautiful place to stay that s still close to the strip but not right on it  Excellent  We WILL be staying there again when we go back  
N => It was so beatiful   
N =>  I had a good experience  
N => Cliffs not Peaceful or Plush  
N =>  Get away from it all but not too away   
N => Would Stay Here Again We stayed for a week in jun of      had an ajoining room  got there and the small rooms a c  didnt work  They offered us   rooms that were not connected but because we had children we had to have a connecting room  so they attempted to repair the a c  They did get it to work  but gave us a complimentary week that we used in june of      to stay free  The staff was great  The accomidations are not the most updated but they were clean and comfortable  We were pleased both times we stayed there  We are planning a  rd trip to vegas and will try to stay there again  great location for being off the strip but easy to get to everywhere from here  Pleased with the pool and friendly service as well  
N =>   Club   is in dire need of cleaning paint and guest services  We are riott owners and stayed here on a short stay exchange  This resort looked nothing like the pictures online  We had to check in across the street  which took forever  then drag our bags across to our room because we had no car  The desk in Club   was never staffed  The menu in the room for ordering food to be delivered was so old that when I called  the place was out of business  The suite was small  dark  and smelled  It desperately needed several coats of paint  We didn t even want to use the kitchen  The bedspread was dirty  We called the Club   desk to ask for a different suite  and were told that nothing else was available  interesting  because we saw very few other guests during our stay  The closest restaurant was Denny s  five blocks away  be our standards as riott owners are high  but this place didn t even come close to meeting our expectations  We will not come back  
N =>  Great accomodations for a stay away from the strip  The front desk attendant was nice and very helpful  The rooms were smaller than I had expected  but because the price was so right on  it didn t really matter  Noise was not a problem as long as we kept the window closed   Traffic noise  One thing that I did not like was that they did not clean your room every day  We received fresh towels and more coffee when we asked    but I kinda like the coming back to the room and having your bed made  Kids loved the jacuzzi style tub in the bathroom and the hot tub near the pool  Location was ok    a very short drive to strip    close to popular grocery stores drug stores  fast food  All in all it was a great trip  
N =>  Good enough to stay again Not bad  We drove so we didn t need the shuttle  Close enough to the casinos to drive and park  then walk  Nice to have the kitchen  Wifi was expensive so we went to Krispy Kreme for their free wifi  Rooms were clean and the staff very friendly  
N =>  Middle of the Road   Nothing Special We spent Mother s Day week at this timeshare resort in a   bedroom unit  Unfortunately  the weather was unseasonably hot  upper   s all week   and the A C was locked to not get cooler than    degrees  and while in the main unit  this temperature was mostly acceptable since we weren t in the room during the day  the secondary unit s A C was horrible and barely kept the room livable at night with the door to the main unit closed  There was a dripping sound from the A C  we presume  in the master bedroom The staff was pretty accommodating when we needed special attention The pool was open    hrs  and while we were on the  nd floor poolside  I don t know if I d want to be on the  st floor when the pool was busy  Additionally  there seemed to be a lot of leaves in the pool by evening We didn t make use of the mini golf or other activities We got a good deal on this location  I don t think I d stay there at full price  
N =>   OK But expected more since it was considered a resort and a timeshare exchange Some points I think are important and wish I would have known before I booked the room  The motel was too far to walk from the strip  so make sure you have a car  We asked for a pool side balcony   We got a pool side room but it wasnt a balcony  It was the first floor and it had plants and a large wall dividing it from the pool area  Therefore when you sat down to enjoy the view  all you saw was the wall since it was too high to look over  In addition   the balcony area was way to small  The inside was fine  rooms were large enough  the pool was fine but not what I would consider a resort  It was simply a OK motel  THE MOST INCREDIBLE DISAPOINTMENT WAS THE FACT THAT THEY PROVIDE NO FREE INTERNET SERVICE  WHEN I CALLED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS AVAILABLE THEY SAID   YES WE HAVE INTERENET  HOWEVER THE TRUTH IS  THEY HAVE   MONITOR AVAILABLE IN THE LOBBY THAT YOU MUST PAY FOR TO USE  It was necessary for us to read our email and get updates from our job  so this was extremely irritating to us when we found this out  The resorts that we have stayed in in the past always have a couple computers that can be used by its quests free of charge whenever and however long you wanted to use them as long as noone else was waiting  So if you want or require the internet during your stay  DO NOT STAY HERE For the money I quess it is worth it  But for us  we have a timeshare and we were dissaponted since we compare this motel to other resorts that are much nicer  
N =>   Started  so so  but ended just fine There are two phases and we went to the wrong one to check in  so we had to get back into the car to drive to the other phase located a block away  Check in went fine but walking to the room  in     degrees was a not a positive experience  Nor was going into a   bdrm unit when the AC was not on  My initial reaction was to check out and go to a strip hotel but instead I thought I would try this place out for a night  Thus  we left the room to do some shopping and other fun stuff  Once we came back to the room that evening  the room was cool and I felt a lot better of this place  I further realized that not having the AC on until check in was a good cost cutting measure that saved money for the hotel  In the end   I would stay here again because it had a pool which was open       the room was clean and had a full kitchen  amp  washer  amp  dryer  the   bdrm offered more room for the kids and at a cheaper price than paying for two rooms at a hotel  you could park your car near your room versus walking    minutes to your room from the entrance of a large hotel  
N =>   Incompetent staff When we arrived  they put us in a one bedroom when we had reserved a two bedroom  They were not apologetic nor did they seem to care  We were told to come back the next day for the two bedroom  They STILL didn t have the  BR ready and we had groceries in the car  Again  they didn t care  We wasted a whole day just trying to get checked in  The place was NOT what I expected  It was not well kept and a little too far from the strip  They also waited until the  th day to tell me I needed a parking pass for my car  
N =>  Positively Disgusted This was one of the worst places I ve ever stayed  The front desk was incompetent  There was no maintenance  only excuses  The elevator was inoperable for   days  The jets in the public hot tub did not work properly  E coli report anyone    They had one excuse after another  We were on the top floor and physically challenged to climb   flights of stairs  hip and knees   The  quot resort quot  offered no assistance or even a change of rooms  Actually  the security crew was the most helpful ones there  The room was dirty   Unless you consider one trip through the room resulting in black soles clean   The shuttles were erratic  Most of the drivers were rude  A couple were good and did their jobs   only a couple  There were items in need of repair that we read in reviews months ago that were still not fixed  I m an owner at Tahiti Village and have never been treated this way  We re shocked and appalled  I find it odd that once employees were informed that we were  quot owners quot  with their sister property   attitudes changed  Everyone should be treated equally and not like their ignorant  I will never  ever stay here again  I ll be certain to tell our friends  This is NOT a   star resort  I wouldn t consider it a resort at all  
N => Would nt stay here again Stayed here through a timeshare exchange program and wasn t very satisfied  They first required a     deposit when we first arrived   not a pleasant surprise but was assured that I would get it back in my account the day we left  Then we get to the room which had a foul odor to it  However the room was a very large space  we had a   bedroom which was a one bedroom unit coupled with a studio  The resort was too far away from the strip though  way too far to walk  Although they do have a bus service which we did use one of the days it doesn t run late enough during the week or weekend so unless you have your own car or feel like paying for taxis it isn t that helpful if you plan on staying out late at night  Luckily we drove there so didn t have to rely on this service all too often  As a last note  a week later they still have a      hold on my account  
N =>   Nice place  a little far for walking to anything Lindy at the front desk was awesome   extremely helpfuf  she printed our boarding passes and was great to get anything we needed  The distance for anything is to far to walk and the shuttle only goes every hour  You would need a car  It was a nice place to stay  clean rooms  friendly staff  There is not a bar on site or close by  if you are wanting a drink so you might bring your own and enjoy the pool side with cocktails  As others have said the walls are thin but there is not an extreme amount of noise  
N => A real nice place to stay outside the strip  I just got back yesterday from a   day vacation with my parents and we stayed here  I really liked it  I am in my mid thirties and at first was bummed that we weren t staying in one of the big hotels on the strip  But then I realized this place was only about a mile away  about a    minute drive so it was no big deal  There are lots of stores real close by    Walgreens  Denny s  an Italian Pizza restaurant  two food stores and fast food places  But my favorite part was the pool  It was pretty big and very clean  with a jacuzzi right next to it  We would get up early  go to breakfast and then lay by the pool for a couple hours before we headed out for the night  So I got to relax too and work on my tan  They even give you   pool towels in your room which was cool  The staff was very friendly  the room was on the small size but we only really used it to sleep and shower then we were out and about again  The grounds are clean and maintained all lined with palm trees which I can t seem to get enough of  The have a computer in the main lobby so I was able to print out my boarding pass for the flight home which was very convenient  This was my first trip to Vegas  or to the West Coast for that matter  so I had to get used to sleeping weird hours and the time change  I am from NJ  but who cares  I was in Vegas   But I would recommend Club de Soleil and would stay here again  you won t regret it  I really have no complaints at all  But I think next time when I return I want to stay on the strip   I think I have to at least one time    
N =>   Very Good Exchange We are riott Vacation Club owners and this was the first time we exchanged our lockoff for a one bedroom at the Club de Soleil  We had some trepidations based on the reviews  but were pleasantly surprised  Although we also went to phase   property to check in  only to find out we needed to go to phase    we met an owner  and he said rooms at both properties were just as good  so when we checked in  they put us in a third floor room in Phase    Our check in process went smoothly  and they gave us a choice of rooms  Our one bedroom was nicely appointed and very clean  Although the main room is slightly smaller than a riott villa  it had all the amenities needed for our family of four  There was a balcony overlooking the pool which was nice  There s not much to the grounds  but there s a quiet pool  fitness room and barbecue  The concierage was helpful and didn t push any of their timeshares on us  It is a couple miles from the strip  and there was a shuttle  which we didn t use   as we simply drove to there and stayed in the free parking lots  I would recommend this as an exchange for those folks who want a quieter trip  with easy access to the strip for gambling  shows and food  
N =>  Wonderful comfortable place to stay Pros   Very clean  quiet  amp  updated  Good sized bedrooms  Heated pool  amp  spa  Cute usable balconies  Lots of towels  soaps  amp  lotions  Free shuttles to strip  amp  grocery store  Nice workout roomCons   Confusing    lobby for   locations  Internet     
N =>  Rotten Location S  S  Time Share Robert and Morris were great staff members  Without the shuttle service this would have been a  quot   quot   Rotten location  old time share  they want to call if Vacation Ownership now   Avoid this place if you can  Tahiti Village looks great  sister local  but the price they want is extreme as far as I can see  The resturant Tahiti Joe s food is only slightly better than the terrible service  The bar staff was good but that was it  Do not stay here unless you have no other choice  
N =>  Very Enjoyable Experience I bought a   BR unit on E bay VERY cheaply  My sister and I flew to LV for a vacation to check out the resort and have some fun while my wife took a vacation to FL for  quot some time away quot  from me Checkin was fast and efficient  The unit was ready on time  The   BR unit in the older  Phase I  section was ideal  It was as close as possible to the handicapped parking section  Phase I is on a side street off of Tropicana so it was quiet  We didn t use the pool or tennis courts  but they were attractive and well kept  The personnel  especially maintenance people  were exceptionally helpful  The concierge had pretty good and fairly reliable information  Since I was already an owner  we were not asked to attend a sales presentation  I didn t even mind paying for internet access in the lobby a couple of times The unit was exceptionally clean  well stocked  large BR and bath  I slept on the couch in the LR  and my sister had the kingsized bedroom  She enjoyed the jacuzzi tub  too  I used the fireplace for ambience at night  although it wasn t cold at all  With the glass closed not much heat was generated  We were on the ground floor so we had a nice patio with furniture outside  Lots of palm trees  Upholstered furniture will need upgrading before long We had a rental car  which is really a necessity to see anything but the casinos  and toured around to many interesting and beautiful spots  Lake Mead  Hoover Dam  Mt  Charleston  Valley of Fire  etc  All shopping needs were close by  The valet parking people at all the resort casinos and show places were very helpful to a handicapped person  We went to several shows  I broke even playing cards  but my sister lost badly on the machines    typical Vegas experience Check out was easy and nearly instantaneous shortly before specified check out time  I d love to go back again soon  
N =>   Very nice accomodations clueless staff We booked a two bedroom unit at Club de Soleil II through Interval International  I had no idea what to expect  since Vegas standards can be very different than standards elsewhere  I was not expecting the Luxor The condo was clean  spacious and well appointed  There was no smoke smell or sanitizer smell    just clean  Everything was in good working order  The beds were king sized and very comfortable  The unit was comparable to nicer units in Sheraton timeshare condos  like the one we stayed in in Scottsdale  Since we went in the winter  we could not use the outdoor swimming pool  although it is heated  and we did see a few crazy people in it  The grounds were very nice  considering the small block of land the resort is on  typical Vegas   The photo on the website is very deceiving   it is a small property  not a huge one  I found the location to be great  Not far from the strip  but not on it  Perfect  I don t care for noise and smoke Parking was easy and ample  which is really important when travelling with kids  The housekeeping staff was very accomodating  No complaints there  If the front desk staff were helpful  this WOULD HAVE BEEN a great Las Vegas destination The front desk staff and the concierge were completely  totally clueless and inefficient  The night we checked in  there were four families couples ahead of us  Check in took a very long time since there was only one guy working the desk  Since we drove for two days to get there  all I wanted to do was park and collapse in bed  While waiting  I overheard the maintenance guy make a bigoted comment about Mexicans  I am not Hispanic  but I was offended  I don t care much for bigotry The resort does not offer much for families  I knew Las Vegas was an adult s town  but I thought a five star resort would have something for kids  It didn t  I guess they are used to having everyone go to the Strip for everything The next morning  I waited an equally long time at the concierge desk  The woman there spent forever with another couple  When it was my turn  I told her straight off I was not interested in a timeshare presentation  and then she seemed to want to get rid of me as soon as possible  All of her answers were short  She told us we could get discount tickets at Tahiti condos  two doors down  We went there  and they told us she gave us the wrong information  Then  we were directed to Tahiti village resort  where they did finally help us  The next day  a different woman at the concierge desk told us the owner s night was cancelled after I asked her where it would be  She called someone who told her there was a special Christmas banquet for        instead  The next morning  I asked yet another woman at the concierge desk if we needed to make reservations for the banquet  She told us it was not on Christmas eve  as we had been told  but on Christmas  and the price was         It was clear they were operating on rumor  not fact sheets or brochures Frustrated  I drove to the other sister   resort  Tahiti Village  and asked what was really available to owners that week  After waiting an extremely long time  three guys asked around and finally found out NOTHING was available to owners at all  and yes  there was a pricey buffet instead  There was no special price for owners  so we didn t bother  So  there was nothing for owners  That might not mean much to people who just want a place to stay  but my family actually like the cheezy owner s events when we go on vacation The only time we were given useful information at the front desk was when a night shift desk clerk suggested we go to the Rio buffet  The price she told us was way off  but the buffet was fabulous  We ended up paying more than we expected  but it was a memorable feast There was no free internet anywhere at the resort  They charge     for the week for internet  which is ridiculous for a five star resort  in my opinion  However  Vegas is Vegas  They charge for everything  Even the Starbucks charged to use their internet Overall  I would reccomend the Club de Soleil for a quiet  well  furnished  well appointed condo  if you do not expect to be entertained on site  or be given accurate information by the concierge  I would also suggest going directly to a concierge at a larger property  who has real knowledge of the area  not just a fly by night time share tourgiver  I would say this is a four star property  which is satisfactory for my family  If you are used to five star  or riott quality  I think the desk staff and lack of owner welcoming events will greatly disappoint you Next time  I think I will go back to the Scottsdale Sheraton to escape the snow in winter  That has been our favorite spot so far  the riott in Palm Springs was also great   See my other posts  
N =>  Most Bad Experience Me and my family spend the   most awfull weeks at this   star hotel  This is presented as a   star resort awhich is definetly not  Service is poor  normally there s no one at the reception  nobody knows nothig  we even had a leak in our room and maintenance people wanted us to change room at midnight  they just came and put some towels on top of the carpet which was soaked  we exchanged our property in orlando s Sheraton Vistana Resort  adn the difference is huge  This hotels rooms are small  with old furniture  everything looks old   We don t recommend this hotel and will never come back  
N =>   Not What You Expect      Booked through Interval International because riott s Grand Chateau had no vacancy over Labor Day weekend  We are riott owner s  in Florida  but were only going to be in Vegas for   days  Let me say right away                lock off rooms are tiny          They are not what they appear to be in the pictures online at the hotel website I have written to Club de Soleil    weeks ago  regarding the problems we had with this property  I am waiting one more week to hear from them about some type of refund or how they would like to handle what turned out to be a huge disappoinment  If I do not hear from them shortly        I will be giving a follow up review next week  
N =>  A Good Hotel Choice If Location Isn t Important I would only recommend staying at the Club de Soleil if location is not important to you  Yes  there are hourly shuttles to a couple of Strip hotels  during my stay it was Treasure Island and New York New York   but unless you re willing to pay for a taxi to and from the hotel  I think around          the shuttles can make you a slave to a schedule  I ve stayed on the Strip before and it s nice to just walk out and be in the heart of Vegas and not to have to rush to catch a ride The room was very clean and comfortable  The bed was good and the kitchenette was great  The shower was just awful though  At times  the water was virtually down to a trickle Definitely ensure you get a room facing away from Tropicana Avenue because it s a very busy street  And also try to stay on the  rd floor  
N =>   Very nice minor complaints My parents own a timeshare with Interval Resorts and they requested this property for the week of ober   th  We had both the standard suite and the lock off room and we had requested Club   because others had indicated on this site that it was staffed    hours a day and was about a year younger than Club    Anyhow  we arrived at   p m   ahead of my parents  but since they had our name on the reservation  they let us check in  EARLY  We did not get the thrid floor we had requested  but only because we were early    Ask for the third floor if you are susceptible to noise  You can definitely hear people above you and no matter how quiet I tried to be on the second floor  my footsteps echoed quite a bit   Negatives Location  The drive down Tropicana is a nightmare  especially at rush hour  which seems to be all the time in Vegas  It took us about    minutes to get from the    Fwy to the property  Also  the people that live in that area drive like maniacs  Now  I drive fast  but I was really worried about my parents pulling in and out of that lot  VERY precarious  This place is quite a ways from the Strip  but since we had our kids it really was not a problem for us  The Orleans is a great  nearby choice Amenities  With no restaurant on site  you will have to go out to find food  Noise  We could hear the people above us around bedtime and a crying baby down the hall in the middle of the night  so these rooms are not soundproof by any means  Being on a busy roadway also made it  quot noisy quot  but only if we left the windows or sliding glass door to the patio open  All in all  it was a quiet place  but there was some minor noise from other patrons My BIGGEST complaint was the lack of places to hang towels to dry after use   There were only two hooks on the back of our bathroom doors and that was it  Nowhere to dry wet bathing suits  wet bath towels  or wet pool towels  I reverted to using the clothes dryer  which by the way was so loud it drove me nuts  I think it was broken because it sounded horrible My second biggest complaint would be the fact that there were NO handles on the inside of the shower doors  They were so heavy and with wet hands  trying to open those bad boys was next to impossible  They really should look into handles  Also  my Mom has mobility issues and while the beds are very low to the ground  the leap up into the shower tub was almost impossible for her  Even I struggled to get into  and out of   the shower Also  we had to make up the sofabed each and every night  Minor  but at a hotel you would likely not have to do this CLEANLINESS I am a clean FANATIC  so no place is ever  ever  ever clean enough for me  but I have to say  with the exception of a few surfaces  this place was pretty clean  I brought my own Clorox wipes  that s how bad I am  and I see dirt and  quot stuff quot  on everything  so when I say it was pretty clean  I need to clarify because I pretty much check out a room from top to bottom before I move in  the walls in this place are in desperate need of paint  Lots of smudges on them and also on the granite counters  fridge handles  etc  One  quot stain quot  that bothered me the most was a little brown smudge right next to the toilet paper holder on the wall  Yes  I know what it was  No  I did not call and complain or ask to get it cleaned  I have vowed to become less neurotic about cleaning and this was my cross for the week  But  if I saw that I can only imagine what else was lurking  Ugh  The shower and sinks seemed to be clean and the carpets looked clean  So  the room was pretty clean  but not clean enough  if you know what I mean  I warned you  I am a clean freak Positives The beds were VERY comfortable and the sheets actually stayed on the bed the whole time we were there Extra pool towels  dishes  sample detergents  brand new sponges  etc  all made this a great spot  We made coffee  eggs and toast almost every morning and even baked cookies on our last day  The clean freak in me washed everything by hand first  The towles were nice and soft and the appliances  toaster  coffeemaker  full size fridge  microwave  oven  etc   were all in good shape  except for that clothes dryer We were glad to partake in the use of the pool and jacuzzi  and although a few people said the pool was too cold  I have to disagree  It wasn t warm  by any means  but it was just fine  I would not have wanted a room over the pool and was quite glad ours was about   suites away  I think     to     would be the range I would stay in if on the second floor  The odd   rooms face the pool putting greens in Club   and the evens face the parking lot  But  the pool was virtually always empty  so I guess it depends on the crowd This is a GREAT place if you don t mind the drive to the Strip  We ventured out to the Hoover Dam  Ethel M Chocolates  rip off   bowling at South Point  NY NY  Fremont Street  etc  and this was a great jumping off point  Highly recommended for families or couples wanting to save a ton of money but still get an AMAZING place to stay  We go to Vegas about   times a year and usually stay on the Strip  but with prices climbing and payouts waning  I would definitely stay here again to save some money for the tables    
N =>   Great Rooms Mediocre Features We arrived in Las Vegas at around   am  Check in at the Club wasn t until  pm  They gladly checked our bags for us which was an excellent plus  We were also able to use the shuttle which was great  also  They told us that they would call us when our room was ready  so we took off to explore the strip  Unfortunately  we never received a call so I suppose our room wasn t ready before four  Upon checking in  we were immediately pleased with the room  We stayed in a two bedroom suite  It was very roomy  One side was a lock off bedroom  with a bathroom and a kitchenette  The larger side was a bedroom  bathroom  full kitchen and a living room  which included a fireplace and a balcony  There were five of us  so the living room with a pull out couch really became a third bedroom  The room was immaculately cleaned and we were very happy with it  One of the jetted tubs did not work  which we didn t discover until nearly the last night of the trip  But  that was the only room downfall The hotel had a pool area  it was way too cold to swim  that  fortunately  also had a hot tub  The area was open    hours  which originally we thought was great  However  it turned out to be overrated  The pool area was literally in the middle of a bunch of other suites  They were behind and right next to other suites  One night  after a long day of walking the strip  we decided to go down and enjoy the hot tub  I wouldn t have even mentioned this had it been true  however  about    minutes into our  quot hot tub experience  quot  a security guard came out from the lobby and told us he had received complaints  as in multiple  of noise and if it continued  he would have to ask us to leave  There had been little to no conversation between the four of us at all so we just decided to pack it in  It would have been impossible for us to have been any quieter  I would suggest that  being that there are other patrons staying so close to the area that the sounds of people moving around in a hot tub would disturb them  they should attach hours to the privileges of the pool The only other downfall of the hotel was that  although you re given a paper schedule of shuttle departure times  they aren t always necessarily accurate  I would suggest arriving to the pick up spot about    minutes prior to the listed time  Upon exiting the door of the Riviera  we saw the shuttle leaving     minutes early  and were left to wait another hour for a returning shuttle  We discovered cabs were a little more convenient for the five of us  resulting in about a           fare from most places on the strip  Also  on the weekdays  the last shuttle leaves at   pm  so if you re night owls  you ll also find this inconvenient  The hotel also offers a free trip to Fremont Street on Wednesdays  but if you want to go  make sure you schedule your spots with the front desk early  By Monday morning  all two shuttles were completely booked  The Deuce also runs to Fremont Street and offers a    hour bus pass for     you can catch it at the Riviera but it tends to be stuffed to the brim and  for the most part  uncomfortable Overall  the hotel is really nice  The staff was  mostly  friendly and they gave us a welcome packet that included free passes to nightclubs and show coupons  We were never once pressured into a sales pitch  it is a time share  after all   I will probably never stay at this hotel again  but merely for the reason that I prefer the hustle and bustle of the strip and this was just a bit too far away from the strip for me  The closest casino was The Orleans and it was about a    minute walk  we did it many times   It was nice to have everyone in our group stay together  where else can you book a two bedroom suite for a good price   so I would recommend this for families who enjoy a laid back vacation  
N =>  nice place The club was nice place to stay  service was good  good location but the pools and spa need better daily attention I have stayed in better   star resorts  but this one was not bad  
N =>   Not Bad  We ll be back  Had a nice short stay at the De Soleil  We stayed for four days  Place was quiet  but no room service  Kitchen was a nice extra  Very clean  Good staff  We ll see ya Thanksgiving  
N =>   Nice Place but small We just returned from a week timeshare at ClubDeSoliel in Las Vegas  It was an exchange for a timeshare  It was a nice clean   bedroom exchange but it was very small  It did compare to the riott in configuration of the room and lack of maid service  The staff was friendly and helpful and the bus service was plentiful  I was just very surprised at the size of the rooms  It was off the strip and didn t have a casino attached which was great for us because we had children with us  We rented a car to see everything else around like the Hoover dam and the Red Rocks but it wasn t necessary since they had trips from the hotel  It was a very nice trip and a good palce for us to stay  
N =>   Very enjoyable stay My husband  daughter and I went to Vegas in y to attend a dance competition in which my daughter was competeing  We were able to obtain a one bedroom unit at Club de Soleil through Interval International  I was not sure what to expect  but was very pleasantly surprised after checking in  We were in the section with the registration center  There is a second section about a half a block further down Tropicana and seperated by an apartment complex  Our room was       I think that was in building    It was the second floor  of    and our balcony overlooked the back parking area  That may not sound very wonderful  but we actually liked it because it was quiet   not near Tropicana  and we could see part of the strip lit up at night  I do not like traffic noise and so this worked out well  It was also in the shade all afternoon so that is certainly better in my book when the temperature was over     degrees  The room itself was extremely clean   and I am very fussy about that  It was not lavish  but nicely furnished and comfortable  The kitchen was immaculate  It could have benefited from a few more utencils and pots  but it was adequate  There is a great and clean BBQ  actually    with granite counters around them outside in the courtyard  We enjoyed great steaks one evening The bed was comfortable and we slept well except for some idiot s car alarm went off   mornings in a row  Same car  don t know why it happened The one thing that I want to really comment on was the high level of service that they provided  Whatever I asked for was immediatley attended to  One evening I forgot to ask for extra linens before we went out for the night  I called the front desk at around   PM not thinking it would be possible to get some  but it was no problem  They had the night security guard bring them up to me  I was so astounded  Also  we were not bothered by the concierge about a time share sales pitch  It was offered  I declined and that was that  She was very helpful about providing us other info that we asked for  The pool was not big  but it was well maintained and wonderfully warm  My daughter and I spent hours lounging in the water  The spa was great too  I loved the shade cabanas they had as well as numerous trees around the perimiter that provided much needed shade from the heat and sun  Yes  some of the leaves blew into the pool in the afternoon wind  but an attendant came around to clean them out  Believe me  I would rather have the shade and put up with a few leaves in the pool   The pool was NEVER crowded while we were there  be    people max and many times we were the only ones there  Loved it    Also there are no posted hours  The pool is open      for those of you night owls who might want to take a spa  I am sure you would have it entirely to yourselves We felt that the facility was well maintained  staff friendly and rooms comfortable  We did not use their shuttle as we had a car  but I noticed one frequently out front  We loved that it was quiet  really only heard noise from above a few times and none from next door during the entire week we were there  and away from the strip  We left feeling very relaxed and would definately return again  
N =>  Comfortable but with caution My wife and I stayed in the small side  The room was comfortable and clean  The bed was soft  However  the doors dividing us from the main room made our first   nights difficult  When the guests came in early in the morning  we were awakened by the noise  The guests were not rude or inconsiderate  They had just come in from a night on the town in Vegas  We had to request a move to room without guests in the next room  The doors need to be sealed better  The guests in the other side were not overly loud  but you can hear everything they are saying especially if they stand next to the doors  I have stayed in other places with the dividing door and not had problems with privacy  If you are staying in both sides with family or other guests  treat it like an extra bedroom  However  if you are paying for some privacy you will be disappointed  We felt like our kids were babies again when we tried to keep our voices low all the time so the adjoining guests would not hear our conversations Additionally  we stayed in section   which I thought would have the main lobby  If you need anything you have to go to section   a short walk away  Not a big problem but inconvenient  There was rarely someone in section   that could answer any questions or handle our problems with the dividing doors Note to Ownership  This has the potential to be a really nice place to stay  but spend some money to improve the dividing doors  It is not a difficult fix  but will cost some investment  I would have to think long on returning with the current situation  
N =>   Great for Groups of     I stayed at Club de Soleil in il      for a bachelorette party  There were   of us girls and we had a   bedroom suite plus a pull out couch  which was perfect for our needs  It was great having   bathrooms and the master bathroom was very large  Check in was at  pm  and we arrived around       We lounged at the pool in the meanwhile until our room was finally ready around       Our room had a balcony on the third floor overlooking the pool  The room was very clean and in good shape  except for the screen door to the balcony which was broken when we arrived  I can only think of   complaints     The shower pressure was not very good  which is very frustrating for girls who have a lot of hair to wash     The hot tub was filthy  I never saw anyone clean it while we were there and it was always full of bugs leaves etc  The water was so cloudy you couldn t see your hand more than   inches below the surface  Otherwise  our stay was very nice  They claim it is a   star hotel  which I would have to disagree with  Though it is a great hotel  it is not to the caliber of other   star timeshares I have stayed at  It was overall a very enjoyable stay  
N => Not a bad place to stay My wife  amp  I stayed here because of our time share Interval International  Interval had it listed as a  star type location  however once arriving I noticed that it was awared this in       Just after it was built most likely  A very unique place indeed  I loved the fact that most of the hallways were open to the fresh air  although the carpet in the hallways was pretty worn  Nice pool area   amp  most of the hotel workers were very friendly  We stayed in a lock off unit  which was probably a mistake  If available I would recommend the entire unit  We did read that on a previous review that the wall were thin  which is very true  this is why I recommend the entire unit   amp  not just the lock off The shuttles to the strip were great  even though we did rent a car  We took the shuttle to the strip if at all possible  becuase of the traffic  The one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that as soon as we were complete checking in  we were subjected to the timeshare pitch  We were basicly signed up for the presentation even though we told them we already owned  Of course the NO OBLIGATION came up we chose that route  Overall not a bad place  but don t let the Interval International book convince you that it is  stars  Again I would not mind staying here again as long as we had the entire unit  amp  not just the lock off  However  If we do return to vegas we may try for the Polo towers or something right on the strip  
N =>  Beautiful My Husband  amp  I have just returned from a week at Club de Soleil in Las Vegas   We had such a wonderful stay here   The staff were great   they were all so very friendly and helpful We stayed in a   bedroom and it was huge   it had a full kitchen   livingroom with a fireplace and sliding doors that went out to our Balcony that overlooked the pool   washer and dryer   it also had   bathrooms which included spa baths                  so very relaxing indeed    They have a shuttle that leaves on the hour to go to the strip and Orleans as well   The stops on the strip are at Treasure Island and New York   New York   One of the shuttle drivers  quot  Clyde  quot  was wonderful  He was so funny and told us stories   he was always so helpful in helping us get to where we wanted to go   a great guy  The shuttle also leaves at  am each day to go to Albertsons Grocery Store   My Husband  amp  I found Club de Soleil to be a great place to relax   it was just a few minutes from the strip so it was very convenient as well   We were there a full week and no one bothered us about taking a tour or about purchasing a timeshare   so that was really great   I would highly recommend the Club De Soleil timeshare to anyone   Its Wonderful   
N =>  Worst place any side of the STRIP This place is a disaster  First of all  we had   rooms booked and all parties came from different places  so we  the final party  arrived last at around  pm  THey told us our bathtub was broken and would be fixed in   hours  We waited and waited but they never called us  We decided to go to the strip while they worked on this problem  We stop at the front desk and when the front desk lady called the maintenance man on the walkie talkie  he doesn t even know what room she is talking about  So  she promises us it will be ready in  more hours  We say fine and go out  We come back at        thinking they would have had plenty of time to fix the room by now  and wouldn t you know it  they gave the room away  Many excuses later  they put us in the bottom floor of a smoky room  We get awoken in the middle of the night to moans and groans of someone nasty above us and needless to say  ask for a room on the  rd floor  They say they have none so we wind up in the loudest room possible  There was a family of elephants above us and John Holmes was next door in a room only separated by a locked hollow door  This went on for a week  It was crap and even worse  it smelled like whatever your neighbor was cooking any time the stove went on  The heater would bellow smoke from other rooms and the phone even rang with a customer on the other line asking for me to connect them to reception STAY AWAY  THIS PLACE IS NOT ONLY A DUMP  ITS RUN BY PEOPLE WHO COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOU  
N =>   happy days My wife and i have recently returned from a month long trip to the states  and the last leg of this trip was spent in the Club De Soleil  Some of the other reviews we had read prior to leaving the UK had made us somewhat anxious  but we needn t have worried as this turned out to be one of the best places we have ever stayed  The apartments were furnished to a very high standard and the cleaning was spot on  The staff couldn t do enough for us and as for the the warning about the dreaded timeshare salesmen we never saw one in our ten day visit  Although the pool area was fairly small  we always seemed to get a good spot to catch some sun  We would not hesitate to return to the Club De Soleil  and would highly recommend it to anyone who has had enough of staying in busy hotels along the strip  PS  dont be tempted to book a studio apartment  its small and the kitchen is non existent  go for the   bed apartment instead  
N =>  Corporate fixed their mistake I wrote the review belong  quot worst stay in Vegas  quot  Some of what I said still stands    their shuttle was a problem  and many of the staff we spoke with were not helpful  However  I wrote a detailed letter to their corporate office explaining the terrible time we had  and the problems we experienced  We got a nice apology  a refund of some of our money and a complimentary stay  So I just wanted to say that someone did listen  and cared enough to try to make right with an unhappy customer  
N =>  No problems from our perspective Just returned from   weeks in Vegas  Had a  BR unit at the Club de Soleil  Was concerned going in based on the wide variance in the reviews I had read  Only negative to report   the down channel button on one of the   TV remotes was defective  Mentioned it to maintenance while they were replacing the VCR with a DVD player   brought a replacement remote within    minutes  Hard to call that a negative Check in  although after   PM  was smooth and quick  Asked if it would be possible for us to occupy the same unit for both weeks to avoid having to pack and move  Answer was that that probably was OK   and this happened without a hitch We used the kitchen facilities and washer dryer extensively  All worked well  Housekeeping willingly supplied additional dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent Noise    there was none  The property was quiet to a fault Time share pitches    was not approached even once in   weeks Parking   ample covered spaces   very valuable considering the Vegas sun  Can t conceive of not having a rental car in Vegas   there are so many things to do   many of which are miles from the Strip  Oh  don t plan to make a left turn out of the property   except for Sunday morning  traffic on Tropicana is completely uncooperative Check out  at  AM   barely took    seconds General assessment   certainly not a riott  but more than adequate for our purposes   and far better than I was expecting given some of the prior postings  
N =>  A Perfect Las Vegs Get Away My husband wanted to vacation in Las Vegas but I wanted some peace and quiet  Club de Soleil was the answer  Check in and check out could not have been easier  We checked out at      AM  All we had to do was call the front desk to let them know we were checking out and also asked them to call us a cab which was there in    minutes  Our stay was quiet and the convenience of the shuttles made getting to and from the grocery store and the strip easy  Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to accomodate us  The fireplace wasn t working when we checked in but first thing the next morning someone arrived to fix it  The room was clean and even included maid service half way through the week  The narrated trip to Red Rock Canyon cost us       each    We have been to many different resorts and this one was the most accomodating and had the most to offer for a peaceful Las Vegas vacation  
N =>  not up to expectations We were told that wireless internet connection was availabe  Hauled our computer      miles to find out it wasn t availabe  Bigest problem was the cheap construction of the rooms  Normal conversation could be heard from the adjacent rooms as though the walls did not exist  Made sleeping difficult  It was    degrees outside and we had to run the airconditioner just to keep from hearing the people and their TV next door  We had reservations for another stay later this summer but will be cancelling them  Not a happy camper  
N =>  Wonderful Resort please disregard the naysayers below A friend and I just returned from an amazing vacation in Vegas  staying in Club de Soleil timeshare we purchased off Ebay  The resort was gorgeous  we stayed in Club     the   bedroom units   and I couldn t have been more pleased  All the comforts of home and then some  The shuttle system was excellent  and NEVER was the driver not on time  I don t know about driver s falling asleep at the wheel  but you definitely have to be on time   or they ll leave with out you Another great thing was that the staff was not at all interested in us because they knew we were not there to buy a time share  That way  we were not constantly harrassed to purchase a time share as many other people were  However  since we were not there to buy a time share  the staff was very unfriendly towards us  The location of Club de Soleil was great for us  There is a bar called  quot Magoos quot  right next door and they are open    hours and also have table top video poker  We met some very friend locals there that made a phone call and got us on the guest list to the House of Blues Foundation Room   Mandalay Bay   which I also highly recomend  if not only for the view   the club was sick    hour pool and hot tub was also key  Only negative  if you re looking to meet people at the club   it s mostly married couples and elderly  But you can always meet people on the strip  bring them back and impress oh and word of the wise  if you want to get to  quot the RIO quot  or  quot the Palms quot   take the Soleil shuttle to  quot the Orleans quot  and the Orleans shuttle will take you to those two casinos Soliel shuttle goes to New York New York  the Orleans  Mirage  and the Riviera That s all from me  AMAZING PLACE   Vegas and Soliel  
N =>  Nothing to Brag About A group of friends and myself just returned from Club de Soleil in Las Vegas and were dissappointed with the place  We had a   bedroom unit with the door connecting the rooms  We were scheduled to have our rooms from Friday to the following Friday  They had asked us to call to let them know when we would be arriving  We called in advance to let them know that our flight landed early Saturday morning and we would be there shortly after that  When we arrived Saturday morning  they said that check in time was     pm and we should return then  We had just driven   hours to the airport and flown all night to be told to come back in   hours  Needless to say  I was not impressed and told them that that was unacceptable since our reservation was actually for the day before  It took some time but they finally managed to find a room to put us into  but it was only the small half to the   bedroom  We were told that the large side wasn t finished being cleaned yet  but it would be done by     pm and we would have access to it then  It was closer to     pm before we were able to get into it  The second irritation we had the first day there involved the internet  We needed to rent a car  but the rates available through Club de Soleil were more that if we had booked at the airport  So we discovered that if you reserve online first and go pick up the car after  you get a deeply discounted rate  We needed to book on the internet  They have internet access in their lobby that is a dollar per    minutes  We tried to reserve repeatedly  but the computer kept freezing  The    minute countdown didn t  however  So time ran out  and we put a second dollar in  We continued to try to navigate the reservation to no avail  Finally  we asked for some help  They offered no help except to tell us that the computer didn t work  They did give us our money back  We explained that we needed to use the internet for all of   minutes  but they wouldn t let us use theirs    they suggested we walk down the road to their sister resort  the Tahiti to use their  pay  internet  We really enjoyed having the free shuttle to the strip  It is supposed to leave on the hour  It actually left anytime between   minutes to the hour  the day we missed it  to    minutes after the hour  the day the driver was sleeping in the driver s seat   The location isn t too far off the strip  but far enough that you need the shuttle or a car rental  It is on Tropicana  which is a busy  noisy road  Please note if you are cabbing    our cab driver from the airport took the long way around to drop us off resulting in a     cab ride as opposed to the     cab ride back to the airport  If you cab  tell the driver to stay OFF the highway  it is unecessary The rooms themselves are nice  The beds are quite comfortable  They have nice pool towels but small  scratchy bathroom towels  The pool was open    hours which was great We were not bothered about timeshares as most people that submitted a review were  but when my boyfriend was cornered and they found out he wasn t married  they lost all interest in him and us  I would definetly NOT stay here again  Too many hassles on a holiday for me  
N =>  Very disappointed  We traded our beautiful timeshare that we have in Colorado    bedrooms   baths  for a   bedroom   bath basic  ugly unit here  We were so disappointed  first they gave us a unit overlooking the dumpster and carport  Also  it was supposed to be a non smoking unit   it stunk with smoke   set in on drapes  etc  We asked to be switched to another unit and the clerk said we would have to wait until tomorrow  We asked to speak to a manager and she was able to find another unit for us on the  rd floor   slightly better view and it didn t smell However  the only good thing we could find out this Club was their excellent shuttle system  Otherwise it is very basic  thin worn out towels  linens  etc  Also  everytime you pass the front desk  during the day  you are asked if you went to your timeshare presentation  when are you going  etc  We didn t go to Vegas to go to presentations    We finally decided that we were not really enjoying Las Vegas by being away from The Strip  We checked out early and went to the new Wynn Las Vegas and finally had a beautiful room with a fantastic view   lush towels  amenities in the bathroom  etc   what a treat and wonderful end to our vacation  I would never return to Club de Soleil again  
N => Great accommodation We have recently got back to the UK and I felt I must write a review to say what a terrific time my wife and I had at Club de Soleil      We couldnt have asked for more from our   bedroom apartment  it was clean  quiet and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay  The pool was small and we were surprised there was no bar  but this turned out to be no problem at all  The staff were friendly and helpful  and the free hourly shuttle to the strip was marvelous  We had a chance to compare our timeshare appartment with a nights stay at Circus Circus to complete our holiday  All we can say  is that it made us appreciate our Timeshare even more  as the hotel was extremely busy  noisy and the pool was overflowing with no space to swim Thank you Club de Solail for making our fist trip to Las Vegas a fantastic memorable experience  
N => Bring earplugs We stayed here because there were no other timeshares available  We had to trade down from a   bedroom to a studio even though they had larger rooms when we got there  I asked not to get the room adjacent the office  They chuckled  Well  the room we were asigned was located next to a couple that enjoyed watching TV all day  amp  night  get a life    So the next day we were moved next to an empty room      until a guy moved in who was on the phone all day starting at  am  Drowned him out with our TV As we headed to our first room after check in an old guy started with the sales pitch  He wanted to know if we were seeing any shows while in town  I said we had our tickets and were tired and wanted to move in  He then turns to my wife and asks her the same question in a manner which I thought was rude  From then on we just ignored him whenever he tried to talk to us  Worked great  
N => Very Nice After reading the mixed reviews  we decided to take a chance and  quot trade quot  with Club de Soleil  Upon arrival  we decided to  quot tour quot  the property alone and determine which rooms in the various locations would be acceptable to us  When we got to the front desk  we told the clerk which rooms where we did NOT want to stay  i e  near the sales office  and were given a key for a room on the fourth floor to inspect before checking in  We were delighted with our room and the east facing location  Tropicana Avenue is a very busy street  but we did not hear any traffic from our room We were up early each day and on our way to various activities  so we never saw any of the sales staff or heard any of the noise coming from the sales area  Only once did they leave a message on our telephone asking us to attend a  quot reception quot   but when we told them we were not interested in purchasing another time share  they never bothered us again The maid service came to clean our room once  as expected and did a wonderful job  We found out our jetted tub was leaking on the neighbor below us  maintenance came in and fixed it immediately We rented a car  so transportation to casinos  restaurants and shopping wasn t an issue  Comfortable place to stay  
N =>  Top Notch Club De Soleil is a great place to stay if you wish to avoid the over rated Hotel madness on the LV Strip  The Club s staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs  The common areas were appealing and the grounds well kept  I had a rental car to get around town so I am not at liberty to judge the LV Strip shuttle service they offer  What I can say is the well maintained buses were always moving  
N => Our second home  
N =>  Just as good the second time around  
N => Great place to stay especially if you dont like staying ON the strip  
N => Comfort Inn great place to stay My daughter and I stayed at a Comfort Inn in Vegas instead of at one of the casino hotels  It was one of the best choices we made  They had in room refridges  extra shampoo  continental breakfast  shuttle to and from the airport  plus to the casino s downtown  Rooms were very clean and sunny   no pun intended   This hotel was so much better then the Borgata in Atlanic City N J  AND they offered free in room internet    Borgata you had to pay for that too  
N =>   You can do a lot better   I ve got to knock this place down several notches  First  the front desk guys were rude and seemed to just wish we would go away upon checking in  Not just passively rude  extrovertedly rude and unprofessional  even by Comfort Inn standards  yes   The hotel is in a noisy  crummy spot  I could hear tons of loud cars and shouting from my first floor  outside corridor  room near Paradise Rd  I know it s Vegas  but the door to my room was very thin  As a solo girl traveler  I didn t feel that safe there  Room cleanliness was not great  They only had wired internet  Breakfast is bare bones and packed with people  I was really disappointed with this place since the other reviews on here made it sound fine  Right when you walk into the horribly outdated lobby  you ll know   if you make the mistake of thinking you can t afford anything else in Vegas  On the contrary  I later used Priceline com  easy to use  to get a much much nicer room on the strip for less money than I paid to stay at the Comfort Inn  For even     you should be able to get a good room on the strip  if that s what you re looking for  You will probably enjoy that much  much more than this crummy Comfort Inn  
N =>  il      Stay We wanted a room for one day as our plane was leaving that evening    am   All we were looking for was a reasonably priced room  around       that was a decent location and also included a pool  We hit the jackpot here with the location  across from the Hard Rock  and there was a shuttle to bring you to the Strip  specific two places  and the airport  The rooms were fine and included a kitchenette  The pool was smaller than appeared online  but was fine although not heated  There were a few restaurants close by to walk to However  the shuttle is not consistent  reminds me of the Mexico trips  to the Strip  And  even though the site and the staff will tell you the shuttle goes to    pm  that s not the case  They informed us to be at the hotel by       for the airport shuttle  We arrived at       and the shuttle was already gone  One of the clerks  Robert  was rude and said you know how it goes  Would I stay here again  Yes  I would  Would I deal with Robert again  ABSOLUTELY NOT  
N =>   Could have been better After getting very bad directions I was finally able to find the hotel  I was surprised by the location  Very conveniently located across from UNLV and the Hard Rock Cafe  The pictures make it look really nice  but the rooms were a bit run down  They could use some updating  The beds could have been more comfortable  Very used rooms  They seemed to be pretty clean though  Very quiet Stayed   night and that was enough  The breakfast was basic but enough was available  The room was small  so it got a bit over crowded and people were tripping on each other to get at the food My son left his short and shirt  We called after leaving and had the hold it at the desk  We picked them up on our return  which surprise me that they actually found them  That was nice  
N =>   Budget alternative to Hard Rock Stayed at this hotel for a Hard Rock Hotel vacation on a budget  For   nights we paid under       One     night a the Hard Rock was going for      This was the perfect situation for us  It is right across from the Hard Rock Hotel Casino  We just went across the street     We had tickets for Bill Mahr at the Joint in the Hard Rock  We also did the Hard Rock pool for Sunday Rehab  It was very convenient   even though we weren t guests in that hotel The Comfort Inn room was just fine  It was not plush by any means  but it was clean and we felt safe  The airport noise was not an issue because the air conditioner noise drowned it out  It was great to have a room in Vegas with an in room coffee maker and refrigerator  
N =>   Not Highly Recommended Although this hotel is not too far from the strip  Las Vegas Boulevard  and McCarren Airport  you can generally get a comparable or better room on the strip for the same money  The room was a little outdated and worn  The staff was not bad  but could have been a little friendlier  We did not feel completely safe in the parking lot  either  as the area is somewhat seedy  there is a low rent strip club next door   We were just looking for something close to the airport for one night  after traveling elsewhere  but I probably would not stay here again unless I got a good bargain  There are a couple of nice things  though  like the Hard Rock Casino being just across the street and the free shuttle service to the strip  
N =>   What a let down We went back to the Comfort Inn having stayed last year  This year we were very very disapointed  We stayed for    days   never again  The Room carpets were filthy our feet were black after walking on them with no shoes  The pool was a aboslute disgrace  I complained to the manager and shamed him into inspecting the pool with me  this was a waste of time as nothing was done  they advertised a heated pool and it was absolutley freezing  the staff argued with me telling me it was not cold   I was the fool in the water  I would advise any one thinking of staying longer than a few days to look else where  I complained to the head office who replied to me basicley telling me tough its a franchise and there was not much they could do  Well I know what I can do   not go there ever again  
N =>   Liked it Liked it Neat and clean with a courteous but efficient staff that had me checked into the hotel in two minutes  I was attending a show at the Thomas  amp  Mack Center  to which I could walk to  and miss all the traffic  Close to everything  however maybe to close to the airport  but so is many other downtown hotels at three times the price  Enjoyed my stay  and liked the refrigerator and microwave in the room  
N =>   Not Bad   We stayed at the Comfort Inn during our stay at Vegas  It wasn t as bad as I expected  It is off strip  so we had to rely on the shuttle to take us to the strip  or take a cab  The hotel itself was clean and pretty well maintained  It is next to a strip club  but it wasn t that bad  My only complaint was the shuttle service  It took forever and the door on the van was broke  Hopefully they have it fixed by now  
N => Wear your socks  This motel was okay if your in a pinch or get a really good deal on the room  The exterior is freshly painted and clean looking  seemed to be in a nice  safe part of town  except for the exotic dancer place next door  but hey maybe your into that   Anyways  I stayed   nights and it seemed like an okay place until you look at your socks the next morning  They were filthy from the dirty carpet  It really grossed us out  Other than that it was okay  The breakfast room was really small and full of people so we passed on our free breakfast  The bathroom was clean  We payed about     bucks to stay there which was too much for this motel for another     bucks you could have stayed at a much nicer hotel and not have ruined your socks    
N =>  Okay   best part was limo This place is three blocks off the strip  Easy walk to Hard Rock  Limo available virtually any time you want it for free ride to the strip  ent pool  Has restaurant but I wouldn t eat there  Did have one okay breakfast  Hotel was very  very empty  Of course  was there in y when it was over     degrees every day  
N => Small breakfast room Stayed at Comfort Inn and had a wonderful stay  Room was clean  comfortable  Had a mini kitchenette  iron  hair dryer  Took shuttle to the strip  When I called for a return shuttle from the MGM it was prompt in getting to us           only about a    minute wait  Staff was friendly at check in and check out  Only real problem with this Inn is the continental breakfast  Only had seating for    people in a small room  Far too small a room for such a large Inn  Continental breakfast had too little choices  Just a couple cold cereals  instant oatmeal  package danish  english muffins and bagels  One toaster and a long wait to get to the toaster if you want to toast your bagel or english muffin  Close to airport and rental car companies  Close to the strip  
N =>  The rotten apple in the Comfort Inn basket Let me start by saying we truly are not picky people  But I was extremely disappointed in this hotel  especially being a Comfort Inn  be we just hit the clerk on an off night  maybe the hotel was full  I don t know  but our room was pitiful  All things being relative  this hotel was too expensive for such sub standard accomodations and service The hotel has a LOT of rooms  but ours was right by the road and the noise level was ridiculous  Friday night   The room was run down  poorly cleaned and smelled musty  I would have gone back and asked for another room  but it was very late when our flight got in  we were beat and we were flying out the next morning  so I let it go  Really the only redeeming factors were the king size bed  microwave and fridge  Since there is no restaurant on the premise we ended up walking down the block to the drug store and bought refrigerated sandwiches for supper   Of course  had to walk past the strip joint next door to the hotel  which blasts music and a  quot play by play quot  commentary over a loudspeaker outdoors   Even the free breakfast was a disappointment  It was located in one of the regular size hotel rooms  so it was crowded and had very few items to choose from  Every employee we encountered had a  quot so what quot  attitude  Even my laid back  get along with everyone husband noticed They did offer a free shuttle to and from the airport  but the van was in such poor condition  I was a little hesitant to ride in it In all honesty I must say I booked this hotel by mistake  We spent a week in Vegas two years ago and stayed at the AmeriSuites just down the street  It was a wonderful hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there  I had forgotten it was AmeriSuites and thought that s where I was booking us again  I really  truly wished I had  Before this experience  I would ve hands down recommend Comfort Inn hotels to anyone   in fact  that s our first choice in hotels  I guess there s an exception to everything  because I wouldn t recommend this Comfort Inn to anyone  even if it were free  
N => enjoyable stay we enjoyed our stay at this hotel  it was clean and comfortable  The pool was small but was never crowded  Although breakfast was provided it did run out of food and this was not replenished  so on our last day there was none  The free shuttle to the airport and strip was good but the last one home from the strip was too early and we had to walk   minutes back several times before we worked out a bus route  
N =>  Loved It But Was Charged Twice    The place was wonderful   clean clean clean  You could hear planes landing all night and day but you get used to it   it s worth it for the price  The only horrible thing is that they charged my credit card after I already paid cash so now I am left with NO MONEY in my checking account until  quot in four or five days we can refund your money Mam quot   This occurred after I asked to make sure that this would not happen when they wanted my card to secure the room  Why can t hotels get this right      
N =>  Bad Experience  
N =>  A nice place close to the action  
N =>  Mostly OK But      
N =>  A pleasant surprise  
N =>  Nice hotel away from the hustle and bustle Stayed here for   nights at the weekend in il      to escape the very high strip downtown casino hotel rates This hotel is fairly new so the fixtures and fittings all look good  The room was clean and tidy and check in staff were pleasant  Not located in a particularly scenic area  but the area felt safe The breakfast was the usual toast  bagels  muffins  fruit  cereal  coffee  juice etc  which would have been fine if we could have found somewhere to sit to eat it  There was a school sports team staying whilst we were there and they took over every table and chair in the lobby area to eat breakfast  and even trying to get to the breakfast counter to choose something to eat was quite daunting with teenagers standing in front of all the food  Anyway  I persevered and took everything back to my room to eat I would recommend this hotel for someone not wanting to pay the high weekend prices of the strip downtown hotels  we paid     a night  which given the amenities and the cleanliness of the hotel was probably about right  
N =>   Better than it Sounds Looks After reading reviews and checking prices we ended up booking the  Cortez for our last night in Vegas for a chance to hang around Freemont  We were cautious when we got there but were told we were upgraded to a non smoking room  as we read to request  and ended up with an awesome room Our room was up a flight of stairs just off the main casino floor   which was reminicent of the rooms above a  saloon  with ladies leaning over the railing  The room we were given was abosolutely enormous compared to the other places we stayed  There was a giant King bed  large tv and large L shaped couch  The bathroom was a little small but I wasn t sleeping in there so that was of little importance If your not necessarily looking to gamble at the hotel but to check out Freemont Street  El Cortez is in a great area with free parking and a good deal if you can get an non smoking room  
N =>   Give El Cortez a Break  This was the second time I stayed at El Cortez  The name  in Spanish  means  quot the courteous one quot   or  quot the courteous man quot   I felt it lived up to that moniker  The staff was beyond lovely  They actually recognized my mom and me from the year before  Not by name  but perhaps by the fact that we re a travelling mother daughter act  It does cater to an elderly crowd  However  I m in my    s and find that I ll take courtesy wherever I can get it  Also  you cannot possibly find better rates for a clean place to stay in Vegas  I loved being able to walk to the Fremont Street Experience  We cam home in the middle of the night  and felt quite safe I won money at El Cortez  too  In the neighborhood of      with only     to start  I give it a thumbs up  definitely  
N =>   Not the place for us Myself  my sister and neice had booked to stay here from  th ember  we had read most of the reviews which all seemed favourable  so we took the chance I have to be honest and say first impressions where not good  old and tatty came to mind  When we got to our room we were very concerned we had booked a pavillion room  This is over the car park  and it is like a      s massionette badly lit  the window looked out onto the walkway between rooms and the glass had wire imbedded into it  the room was also very small  even by british standards  and as   women we felt very vunrable and unsafe as this hotel is downtown and miles from the strip  We booked into circus circus that same night and left  When we went to check out  this was only one hour after checking in  not one question was asked as to why we where booking out  which i felt was very odd  Don t get me wrong i am not slagging the hotel or the staff off  I just felt that there were no reviews from the UK on the site  and maybe this is just not what we want from our visit to Vegas  
N =>   Best Overlooked Bargain on The Strip We went to Vegas for the Halloween Ball  Fetish  amp  Fantasy Ball       We waited to book our room till one week before the event We used trip advisor to find reviews on the bargain hotels offered We saw other reviews giving it     ratings  We were unsure  We drove from Phoenix to the hotel  It is conveniently located off the freeway  Free valet parking from friendly staff  Easy to check in at a small desk  The tower rooms are nice  When we walked in we were really impressed  The room was nice  clean  absolutely no odor   non smoking   We had two double size beds that were really comfortable  The view was down the strip  We were with in walking distance of the Freemont Street  This was a great deal  
N =>   No frills Vegas No Frills Vegas Run  My husband and I in our mid fourties needed to make a weekend run to Vegas for some business and wanted to find a cheap clean place to stay  It was Barret Jackson weekend and rates were high so  based on reviews we read here we tried the El Cortez   At under    dollars a night I wasn t expecting much   Arrived late just before midnight but room was clean and ready  The lady at check in  the bell man and valet were all very friendly  To our surpise we were given a coupon for two free nights in ember Our Tower  rd floor room was larger than most casino rooms we have stayed in  The bed was a little firm but the sheets were crisp and clean  Bathroom was old but clean  no view but  hey its vegas we justed wanted a clean place to sleep  The only issue we had was at      am we had a little old lady outside our door trying to use her key to get into our room  she was lost   My husband yelled through the door and she left  You can hear some hallway noise in the room if the tv is off  I am a sound sleeper so this wasn t an issue for me  I would say the room is equal to a holiday inn or comfort inn  If you want glitz and glamor this isn t the place  All of the staff we encounterd were great  Loved the Bartenders as long as you are playing the drinks were flowing  We had dinner at Roberta Steak House  it was very good and about       for two without drinks  The casino wasn t our friend this trip as far as winning but we arent high rollers  It was fun  If you are on a budget this is a great place to stay and the rates are reasonable  I have stayed a lot of the cool vegas places such as Golden Nugget  Excalibur  Luxor  TI  Rio and the Palms you can t compare this hotel to those  However  if I need a cheap rate this will be my first look  
N =>   Nothing Special This is my  th time in Vegas    st time on Freemont Street  After looking at numerous reviews we decided to stay at the El Cortez The staff was so unenthusiastic  Housekeeping was the worst I have ever seen   possibly understaffed  Food was ok  I will have to say we felt very safe   as far as the area  We would not go back 
N =>  New Favorite My mother and I share holidays in Las Vegas  she lives in Florida and I am overseas   We have been staying at Sahara recently  but wanted to try a Fremont hotel  I had been to El Cortez in      and remember what a run down place this was  but also knew the hotel was remodelled  We were thrilled with our selection  The remodelling was total and comprehensive to a very high standard  The spirit of the hotel was fantastic We were greeted at check in with a long list of coupons and offers  We liked the food so much that we took all of our meals in the hotel  even after the coupons ran out  One of the staff tipped us off for newspaper coupon to dinner at Roberta s  Every meal was delicious  The room was very nice and clean    better than comparable at Sahara  The only suggestion we would offer is that the water pressure is low at certain times and showering could be slow or cold  
N =>  WOW      More than expected      WOW     First off this place is GREAT      They allowed us to check in early and gave us a free upgrade to a tower room  The tower rooms were spacious with   queen beds and the seating alcove  The non smoking rooms smelled fresh with out even a hint of cigarette odor  A fridge was delivered free of charge just by asking for it  Our meal at Roberta s was the best of the trip  the     off coupon made it an even better deal      For my Guy s trip this was ideal as the Fremont St  experence was easily within walking distance  This place was so good that I would be willing to bring my wife next time  and she is definetly a tougher critic  I feel that these rooms were even better than the room we stayed in at the Monte Carlo in ch     
N =>  Never Again    Un American Hotel Policies   I have stayed at El Cortez before  with no problems whatsoever   and gave them a favorable review at the time  BUT my stay last week will be my last First  the good things  the room was clean again  the staff were courteous  the bellstaff and valets were particularly helpful when my shuttle back to the airport failed to show up  having booked me for  quot a m  quot  instead of  quot p m  quot  pick up The bad things  There was not enough water pressure in the shower to wash shampoo out of my hair   all week  despite having reported it on Monday  The icemaker was out for the last   days of my stay   despite the malfunction being reported promptly and temperatures each day being over     degrees  I had to go to the casino bar to request ice  Most of the electrical outlets in the room were shorted out  and I required one for a CPAP machine nightly The WORST thing  and the reason why I will not return  I do not drive  so my passport is my primary  and only government issued  form of identification  Although I was registered with no incident on my prior stay  this time I had to deal with   people before the hotel would honor my reservation because the hotel has a policy of NOT ACCEPTING A U S  PASSPORT OR MILITARY ID for identification purposes  But  my hotel slot club player s card was accepted to permit me to register   Something s wrong with this picture There are people staying here from countries all around the world   who  obviously  do NOT have U S  state issued photo identification   and their passports are accepted but a U S  Passport or MILITARY ID is NOT     Additionally  we re being told to  quot green up quot  our way of living  but we have to have a driver s license to stay at this hotel  I don t think so In my opinion  El Cortez s policy of refusing to accept a U S  Passport of Military ID is unpatriotic  un American  biased  discriminatory  and just plain assinine  I ll spend my money at locations where the American Military and our Country are respected more than a company slot card of foreign passport  
N =>   LOVED THE EL CORTEZ We stayed at the El Cortez from e   thru     We had a tower room  upon check in I had asked for a corner room but they had none available  We requested a roll away bed because my daughter had a slight mishap and sparined her ankle  so the bed was free of charge  they also provided a wheelchair   but in the casino and cafe only  We were in room      very clean   beds  a sofa  we needed a fridge   that was brought up right away  the Bathroom   a little small for   women   but adaquate   The TV was not a flat screen  but it was big  there was a desk also  which we used for a vanity table  The Air was EXTREMELY COLD  but after walking in the sun  it was refreshing to come into the room  The only complaint we had was on check out day  there was very little HOT water     other than that  our stay was excellent  The ElCortez Staff was professional and friendly  everyone was courteous and asked us if everything was fine  My sister was given a free enrty for the slot tournament and she ended up winning         We played on the Roulette tables for a long time and we even learned how to play craps there and we won  It was great  We did eat at Kitty s cafe  the portions were huge and we used a coupon from the fun book  We also drank at the bar in the back by Kitty s  the Batender was from Brooklyn      He made my sister a drink for her Birthday  and he was very amusing and friendly  we sat there for at least an hour Overall  We will back to the El Cortez   the location and the price and just the overall freindliness of the staff is remarkable  
N =>  Great service great value My husband  amp  I booked a week s stay at the El Cortez  just a block from the Fremont Street experience  I was skeptical about staying in downtown Vegas  but I can honestly say I had no reason for doubts  From the bell service as soon as we arrived  through our last day s checkout  we were treated like old friends  amp  valued customers  even though this was our first stay there  My husband even got to play poker with the owner  The casino smells fresh  amp  is breathable when you walk in  despite the smokers   something unique  in my experience  We had a jacuzzi suite  which would have gone for much more on the Strip   but you have to call the hotel to get one  They ve been reserved in the past for high rollers  amp  pit bosses  It was a great value at      for a weeknight  They ve just recently been made available to the public  amp  I m so glad we booked one   Everything about this smaller hotel  amp  casino was clean  friendly  value oriented  the players  club is defeinitely worth joining   amp  focused on customer service  This will definitely be our place from now on  
N =>   El Cortez Is Not Bad We went to Vegas last week and stayed at the MGM   but I also booked a room at the El Cortez for     one night free the next for a  quot Vintage Room quot  because I figured if we wanted to hang out downtown   a     room for   nights was cheaper than a DUI driving back to the strip  We arrived early and they had a room ready for us  Check in was quick  Hotel room was nothing fancy  but very clean  View was of a wall   but not a big deal to us  Cleaning lady  quot cleaned up quot  got rid of some things we had left laying out from other casino s such as playing cards from the Four Queens  etc  which I found kind of strange  but oh well   no harm done  Roberta s was a GREAT place to eat  especially with the     off coupon I had  and I loved the casino there  Walk felt very safe from Freemont experience as long as you stayed on the same side of the street as the El Cortez  Saw   security guards on that side  Other side had some people begging for money  etc  
N =>   Big rooms however cigarette smoke was very strong  A pretty cheap place to stay  Paid US    excluding tax  The rooms were big  Towels were clean  However  the rooms  even the non smoking ones  smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke  I changed   rooms and the smell was still there  In the end  I gave up and just slept there for one night  Probably the smoke came from the central air con  but I am not sure  Another thing was that  in order to go from the parking garage to the rooms  you had to pass through the casino  Seems like that is quite common with hotels with casinos in Vegas  This hotel has no free wifi but has free parking  
N =>   Would stay again  Thanks to all the other reviews we weren t alarmed by the neighborhood We felt safe walking the two blocks to Fremont Street at all hours of the day or night This was a complete different Las Vegas trip  as we are used to the hotels on the strip  The El Cortez was perfectly fine for our needs  Check in was fast  The tower room on the  rd floor was huge and perfectly clean  The bed was great  No view of the strip from this room however The casino was pretty lucky You must try the Top Gun slot machine by the elevators  It is fun to play and we cashed out big three times in about    minutes  practically paid for our trip  
N =>   Got Our Money s Worth My husband and I just returned from a   night stay at this hotel  It is located just a very short walk from the Fremont Experience area  and was easy to find from the freeway A previous review I had read was accurate regarding the check in process  We had booked our stay a month in advance thru Expedia however the clerk could not seem to locate our pre paid reservation  He asked us to step aside while his manager looked into this  All in all it took    minutes to get this straightened out  clerk was apparently mis typing our name into his computer   and the rest of the stay was just fine The hotel and our room were clean and seemed to be well kept  There was not a mini fridge in the room as I had hoped  so we just used our small ice chest  An ice machine was conveniently just down the hall from our room  If staying in the tower  I would reccomend requesting an odd numbered room  as these are the ones that face the strip and offer a great night time view The valet area was swamped and there was a short wait for our vehicle  When going out to the strip the valet called a cab for us which showed up almost immediately  We enjoyed the more intimate feel of this hotel  as opposed to the enormous grounds of the newer hotels on the strip  And this was well worth the money We will definately return  
N =>   Three days at the ElCo We stayed at the El Cortez         returned yesterday  Three of us traveling together were given a corner room on the  th floor  it was enormous and the beds were quite comfortable  Although it s a  non smoking  room  the smell of smoke in and around the room is overwhelming  both  old  smoke smell from the carpets  hallways  etc   as well as fresh smoke that seemed to come in through the ventilation system  Checkin was fine  the bellman  William  was super helpful  Food was OK  actually Careful Kitty s is pretty good  The buffet  both the breakfast and the Chinese buffet later were fine  not outstanding  but fine Housekeeping left quite a bit to be desired  however  All that was done each day was to make the beds and change towels  no straightening up was done by staff  In fact  a dress I d left on my bed was wadded up and left on the nightstand  I found that odd  and tipped accordingly the next day Slots were loose  I won lost several hundred over the course of a day  Remember to cash out when you re ahead  They do have    single deck blackjack  which is where I spent most of my gaming time  Did OK  so nothing to complain about Definitely a locals place  the only thing I found disturbing was a couple who were trying to take turns gambling with a young child standing just barely off the gaming floor  Security told them several times that they needed to take the child off the floor  but they got rather hostile and belligerent In all  it s an Ok place to stay  provided you have modest expectations  
N =>   Good room stinky lobby We booked this hotel via travelworm com for     nt for two nights on         We got a two queen bed Tower Room above the garage  The room is big  the beds and sheets are clean  but the bathroom is small  It s a smoking room  but we felt comfortable and didn t sense any bad smell  we re not smoking persons   It s located in LV downtown  two blocks from Fremont Experience  and about      minute drive to the strip  They also have free parking lots  but no free internet  So far  everything is good as we spent most the times out of town and just needed a place to sleep  However  the lobby casino area is very stinky with smoke  It s so stinky that we didn t even care to use their free     gambling coupon as we had to run into the lift every time we had to pass this area  Fortunately  we rent a car and could access the lift from parking lot Overall  it s good value hotel for budget minded travelers  If you need an up scale hotel  it may not suit you  
N =>   Would stay again After reading some of the negatve reviews on the El  my husband and I were a little hesitant to stay here  but didn t have a choice as this was one of those free trips  Having said that  I was pleasantly surprised  When we arrived  the gentleman checking us in asked if we were smokers  and we told him no  He said that he had upgraded us to a king non smoking room at no additional charge  We stayed in what I would call the old part of the hotel  The room was clean  and I have a thing about that  and well supplied  the bag of goodies that others have referred to  other than the fact that there was no hair dryer  I had checked the hotel out online though and knew to bring my own  so no problem there  The front desk workers were very nice as was most of the staff I dealt with  We received our  quot fun book quot  of coupons after check in  It contained things from a complimentary drink to       slot play and       table play  The room was good size with a sitting area  The bathroom was just a tad small  but doable  The water was hot   The best part though was the bed  The mattress and pillows were great  I have a thing about that too   I slept great  The first day we ordered room service for breakfast  The food was good  However  they did not provide any salt and I find that to be a necessity  We did not receive any comps as others have talked about for the dinner at the casino  so after looking at Roberta s prices  we opted to eat at Fritzgeralds  a short walk from the hotel   They have some great specials  but watch for the times   We took other s advice from this website and used the Duece bus to get to the strip    they are nice  clean  double decker buses and a great deal at       per person for a    hour pass  Never had a problem walking to and from the bus or the Freemont Street Experience  I recommend seeing this   Okay  you ve heard the good  now the other side of the coin  I really only had two complaints  As others have stated  even our non smoking room was a little smoky  but not unbearable  Two  when I used my complimentary drink coupon  I asked for a Crown and Coke  The bartender told me that he couldn t do that for free as Crown was top shelf and asked if I would settle for a Jack and Coke  Didn t quite think that was right  But all in all  I would do it again  
N =>   Tower Room   Huge  We were rush and had to pick El Cortez coz it s farther from the stripe  it was around the thanksgiving and we paid      a night  we had the Tower Room and   queen beds  this is the biggest room i ever stayed in with this rate it is a old hotel  the lobby stinks badly  would be better if you are a smoking person   we had to run to the elevator so we dont have to stay in the lobby for   more sec  once you went up  air is good  Surrounding area is not pretty at all but we just need a room and bed to stay  i like the bathroom  the beds were nice  heater is HOT  i like the old classical style of the room  during my stay  they offer   free nights in dec when you stay   nights in   was a great deal  we got the coupon but didn t have time to return  
N =>  Will never return I stayed at the El Cortez for two nights  I booked online through travelworm com  I paid extra to be in a Tower Room as the reviews said it was newer and slightly larger room  When I got to my room it didn t appear to be correct but I know the pictures online aren t always correct  It wasn t until the next day that I found out that they stuck me in a pavillion room instead of the tower room The pavillion rooms are located outside  The walls are fairly thin  At one point during the night we could hear a man and woman arguing about how much she was supposed to get paid  We tried the cafe downstairs the service was horrible  It took an hour just to have breakfast and    to    mins of that was waiting for our order to come out  And besides that later that day I got sick from what had to have been the eggs I had ordered If I wanted this kind of experience I would have stayed at the Motel   next door  The only good thing I can say is that the room appeared to be clean but who knows  
N =>   SeedyScaryCraphole of a place  be this was cool back in the day but not anymore  The rooms are falling apart  I saw an elderly man get beat up literally outside of the main entrance  I am not that picky of a person but safety is everything to me and I appreciate clean rooms which you will not find here  This is a seedy hotel in the questionable part of Las Vegas  
N =>  More than I expected My daughter and I stayed here from ober        I had booked a pavillion room  When we arrived I found we had been upgraded to a tower room  The view from our room on the seventh floor was of the mountains soaring in the distance  We ate at two of the restaurants and the food was great  The Chinese buffet was exceptional and the staff treated us like royality The servings in Miss Kitty s were more than we could eat  The staff   from the desk clerk to the bell man to the security guards were polite and helpful  I can t say enough good thing about El Cortez  We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Las Vegas  It was refreshing to stay in this area away from the noise and all the too bright lights on the strip  Plenty of shopping and eating places within walking distance Way to go El Cortez  
N =>   I got a really really good deal    I have stayed in Las Vegas many many times  and I like to stay at the Lady Luck hotel downtown  Unfortuntaly that is now closed so I had to pick some place else  I choose the El Cortez because I found a mistake on the internet  I stayed at the El Cortez from e   th   y  th       and my entire stay was only         We had a vintage room   only one flight of stairs  not bad  The room was very clean   but small only one queen bed  The bathroom was fine  but no vanity  Water pressure was a little weak   but it did the job  The first night the shower door fell off the track  I told the front desk the next morning and it was fixed right away  the pillows were a little thin asked for extra no problem  asked for an extra blanket the room was a little chilly  No problem getting the blanket  They must pump air freshner into the casino because it always smelled like colone  if your senative to that you might want to stay elsewhere  The walk to the Fremont Street Experience was never any trouble  always felt safe even late at night  The breakfast buffet was a little skimpy but the price was right       If you use the       meal coupon in the fun book it was a steal  All in all it was a nice stay  and as I said I got a really good deal  I was not expecting much for what I paid  I was very pleased with what I received  On their web site they show you pictures of the rooms and casino   and they look the same including the bed spread  I would stay here again  
N =>   El Cortez Awesome Price Great Hotel  We booked this hotel  expecting a no frills  budget hotel  We paid for a pavillion room above the parking garage  The room was very clean  and the sheets and pillow cases changed everyday  The room itself showed a bit of age  but we expected that because it is an older hotel  Also  the bathroom was fairly small  and had no hair dryer   but we read reviews before coming  so we brought our own hairdryer  We were very happy with the hotel  even though they were undergoing construction  and felt that it is above average for the price they we paid  The area of town is not that great  and we were warned by the taxi driver to not venture past our hotel at night  and to mainly stay by freemont street  which was about   blocks away   However  we did feel safe walking around even at night  There were cameras and a security guard outside the hotel at all times After arriving back home  I realized that if I had paid big money for a hotel on the strip  I would have been disappointed  We were only in the room long enough to sleep and shower  The rest of the time we were out sightseeing and experiencing Vegas  If we were to return to Vegas  I would not hesitate to book this hotel again  
N =>   Good room at a great rate Stayed two nights in a Tower Room  The room was very large  but its bathroom was a bit on the smallish side  The room showed a bit of age  but everything was very clean and a great place to get a quiet nights sleep  Check in was quick and friendly  The price is right because you don t have to help pay for volcanoes  pirate shows  or giant fountains  The Fremont Street Experience and numerous other casinos are just a couple blocks away  
N =>   Not for more than one night The hotel is old and has no insulation to block out road noise or the construction noise going on around the El Cortez  We booked from the El Cortez website where they could have posted the construction occcuring but they did not  The purchase of ear plugs helped some but not enough  We stayed for    nights and was exhausted by the time we checked out  Management did not appear interested in whether we were comfortable  We will not stay there again nor will we recommend it to others  
N =>   Clean room not so safe neighborhood We just got back from the El Cortez   our first time staying here and first time staying downtown  The hotel is going through some renovations   the sports book was fantastic  The front desk staff was nice   I had read some posts about them not being friendly or knowledgeable  but we didn t experience that  The room was nice   very clean and comfortable  We requested a non smoking king room and that was what we received  However  the area surrounding the El was fairly undesirable  It was a two block walk to the Fremont Experience and the first block was pretty shady  Just remember   this hotel is downtown  We live in Detroit  so we re used to a shady downtown  but I was somewhat surprised by this in Vegas  I never felt unsafe  but I wouldn t walk alone  even during the day  Also  a few of the dealers at El could barely count  It was okay for short periods  but we did the majority of our gambling elsewhere  The price of the room was fantastic  so if we wanted a cheap trip  we would stay here again  I think I would have rated this higher if I realized how different downtown was from the strip  If we were staying downtown  I would recommend the El   save some money on the room  cause in Vegas there are definitely more fun ways to spend that  
N =>  What an experience We booked this hotel because we wanted something cheap and closed to the airport  within    minute drive   We were using the room to catch     hours sleep before our flight left the next morning We arrived from Hawaii at midnight and got to the hotel shortly after that  to be told that there computer systems had been down all day and they had manually check in and check out guests and that needed to set aside and wait a while before they could determine if they had any rooms available for us  My hushand threw a fit and told the girl we needed a room to catch a few hours sleep before we checked out the next morning at  am  Finally  they gave us a room key  It was      by then   Needless to say I got   hours sleep that night  Room itself was just okay  THEY DO NOT HAVE A HAIR DRYER ON THE WALL   so you ll need to call housekeeping and they bring a regular one up to your room  Bathroom is very  very small compared to other hotel rooms  Bed was comfortable  or was a little out of date but that really didn t concern us too much  
N =>  Hated it The El Cortez was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  One bad experience after another  I stayed there for two days  When we got in the elevator to a pavillion room I knew there was a problem right away  When you get off the dirty elevator you are staring at a dirty window overlooking a dirty roof  This was only the beginning  the air conditioning sucked  not to mention the toilet  We saw people getting arrested and were woken up by a fighting couple in the next room  They also put a hold on my credit card even though I paid cash for the room  The staff was rude  when we saw a bell boy and we were tiredly carryng our luggage he did not even offer to take it  I will never stay there again  It was heaven to get out of there  Lori Canyon Country  CA 
N => Absolutely Horrible Experience My wife  who has never been to Vegas  booked us in the El Cortez thinking it was  quot on the strip quot   It isn t  It is in seedy downtown Las Vegas   an area where you might not feel comfortable walking after dark  Although my wife called ahead the morning we were to arrive confirming her request for a nonsmoker room  they did not save one for us  We were given a  quot vintage quot  room  code word for a room that has not been updated since        At five AM the fire alarm went off for    minutes  The announcement said that evacuation was unnecessary  but they allowed the alarm to continue anyways  The next morning  we checked out  abandoning our already paid next night  This was the most horrible experience we have had at ANY hotel ANYWHERE in the world  Too bad Trip Advisor does not allow a  quot zero quot  rating  
N =>  Great place  but    We just got back from spending a week in Vegas at el Cortez  We spent six days in the tower room which was in excellent condition  The tower room was spacious and very clean definatly worth the extra money  Our room looked over the Valet parking which was ok cause we could watch over our car  We did hear some sirens but if you party right in Vegas when you are in your room you can sleep through anything  Housekeeping came really early so make sure to hang your sign on the door if you want to sleep past  am  We also spent   days in a pavillion room wich was much smaller and literally above the parking garage  There were a lot of cameras and A security Guy who had a severe limp  I still felt safe though with all the cameras  The only downfall of the hotel was the staff  The check in staff was short and rude not what you want to encounter after spending    hours in a car to get there  Plus plan a good half hour to    min to check in only one staff person to a huge line  The cocktail waitress that we dealt with was even ruder   My husband was in the process of changing machines  we had been there for an hour and it was the first waitress to come around  when the waitress came around he asked for a coke and she refused to bring it because the game ticket that he had in his hand was still not in the machine  I had a       check out and they deactivated our keys at noon  so I had to wait    min for them to activate the key and then    min to check out once we able to get the baggage  The staff lady then chewed me out cause It was      before I reached the front of the line to check out  The building is in great condition  the area is secure  but the staff needs to learn to be more curteous  but then again how much time do you spend with the staff when you are in Vegas  
N =>  Old Vegas Charm I made my reservation at the El Cortez well in advance of my trip to Vegas il        Family and friends all had antidotes about the El Cortez and the downtown area  I found all thier concerns to be unfounded  We reserved a Jacuzzi suite and it was very impressive  Clean  comfortable  and no detail was left to chance  The desk staff  especially George  were all so kind and attentive to our every need  The valets were also equaly impressive  One afternoon we were to meet family across town  When I asked for directions  the valet was aware of rush hour traffic on the freeway  and was kind enough to provide me simple and very helpful directions to our meeting place  We only ate in Kittys once but found the food very good and the prices reasonable  From the hostest  to bus and wait staff  they all exibited a friendly attitude and willingness to serve  We made a couple of trips to the gift shop and found the merchandize of good quality and value  It was nice not to feel like they were trying to gouge you  As for the gaming areas  the slots were not as loose as we had hoped and the hostesses did not offer drinks very often  In fact we did not have a single drink served to us by a cocktail hostess  The casio was smoky at times but no more so than many of the other casinos we visited  All in all  the El Cortez was a great bargain and we would not hesitate to stay there again  For those looking for the old Vegas charm  the El Cortez has it  
N =>  El Cortez The front desk is Rude and the note efficient at all They don t acccomadate any request even though it was already listed on the online reservation  The tower room we booked online was not given to us even though we paid for one  we got ripped off the bath tubs were scary looking and the shower heads so low  it was hard to take a shower if you were tall the beds were on the soft side the rooms and hall ways had horrible smells the only good thing was the very friendly maid the walls were thin  you can hear things easily  even when the room above you has the shower head on Don t stay unless you are dirt poor and have no place to sleep  
N => Excellent value I had read the negative reviews and must admit I was worried about staying at this hotel   We were there in ust         However  to my suprise  it was excellant  I have stayed at Mirage  MGM  Harrahs  etc  and they were also nice but way  way overpriced  I come to Vegas to gamble not stay in my room  Yes  the casino was a bit smokey  but bearable  I am not a smoker but I still gambled quite a bit at the El  The food was good and the rooms were clean  The bathroom was small but clean  Also  you didn t have to walk a mile to get to your room when you got off the elevator   that s nice after all the walking that you do while in town  The crowd was a little older than the strip crowd  However  this was not an issue for us  I agree that this is not the place to stay if this is your first trip to Vegas  but I believe this is by far the best value in Vegas for seasoned Vegas vacationers  By the way  we plan to be in town again next week  staying at the El Cortez  
N => Greatly Surprised   We were under a budget for this trip to vegas  We read reaviews and after many others who have already been to vegas warning us about  quot downtown quot  I am glad we booked this hotel  The staff was a bit rude and slow at times  but you pay what you get for  The room was VERY large in the tower  compared to what I ve stayed in at other budget hotels   The rooms did not reek of smoke we stayed in a smoking room  our friends did smoke next door  The bathrooms were a bit weird and the showers could use some attention  the shower heads sprayed weird  All in all  the    bucks a night was well worth it compared to the hundereds to stay on the strip  As for safety  I personally felt safer downtown in Fremont than on the strip  We saw plenty of officers and bike cops downtown  When we were on the strip it seemed like every few inches we were being harrassed by the  quot strippers direct to you quot  people  I would highly recommend this hotel to any budget traveler  
N => Pretty decent for the price    I booked this room through Travelworm and got it for     night during the SEMA car show in Vegas when all of the prices at all other hotels went WAY up  I was happy to find something reasonable during that time  Surprisingly  the room was tastefully decorated  we got a room in the old  vintage section   My only complaints was that there was a fan right outside of our window that was REALLY loud and that there was never hot water in the shower  lukewarm at best   There was always parking in the garage and the food at the coffee shop was really good  we got      certificates at check in  which made the breakfast really cheap   Also  the DO NOT DISTURB sign didn t seem to work that well in that they knocked twice to see if we wanted our room cleaned  even though the sign was up  It s in kind of a sketchy neighborhood  I was asked for money and if I wanted to buy drugs more than once  This really doesn t bother me that much  but I could see how it could some people  I didn t gamble at all at the hotel  just used it as a place to sleep and drove to do other things  I m not sure if I d necessarily stay there again  but it was okay  
N => Have not stayed here and now I never will     After reserving a room here and unfortunately having to have cancelled it  my checking account was charged one nights stay in error  Apparently there was a mixup between Hotel kingdom and the hotel and each is blaming the other for it  Subsequently  I am out that nights stay and bank fees  I have attempted several times to resolve this with their accounting department to no avail  I have not received phone calls back from upper management after a first call which led to no resolution It is obvious that they have no interest in fixing their mistakes or in taking care of customers  nor does Hotel Kingdom  I have attempted to contact both businesses to resolve this I sincerely hope that no one else has a similar experience  I would recommend blocking any charges in the event you have to cancel your reservation so that your situation does not end up like mine  costing you time  money and a poor experience  
N =>  Hotel El Cortez Great Place to Stay This was our first trip to Vegas  and we were looking for a nice and reasonable place to stay  The El Cortez is off the Fremont Street Experience  but the walk was not bad  The hotel is located in a diversed part of town  but we did not have any trouble at all and were not afraid to walk back to the hotel at night  The room was small but very well decorated and clean and confortable no problem with nose  But would stay in the main building next time  The food was good and staff was pleasant  Gambling was good and we only seemed to win or break even at the El Cortez The staff were great  the valets were extremly friend and helpful  We would recommend this hotel to any one that would like to go to Vegas and not have to pay a arm or leg for a confortable and pleasant hote  
N =>  pleasantly surprised We stayed here on the Friday and Sat night of our trip when the rooms on the strip were more than we were wanting to pay  We went in with low expectations and they were exceeded the rooms are basic but clean  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful we were pleasently surprised the only complaints we had was the water in the shower was tempermental going from icy to scalding without touching it  The service at careful kittys was poor also the busgirl got our tip as she did most of our serving  Metting the owner of the casino was excing to me his hidey ho how ya doin made my day  
N => LIKED IT  We got a cheap price       pp flight hotel   nights  from cleveland   The rooms were very impressive  They were clean and updated  the furniture was very nice  we had stayed before at the Golden Nugget  which is very nie  and the Four Queens  which we did not enjoy at all   The El Cortez rooms were as nice as our Golden nugget room  The casino itself was sort of dingy  but we wanted    blackjack tables  and defiantely found them  The food in the hotel was decent  yet pricey for las vegas  We felt secure at the hotel  We defiantely would stay there again  As for the loose slots  we did not experience that  but others seemed to  
N =>  Surprised   No Shocked    My wife and I have gambled at the EC for many years  The casino is old and smokey but very friendly  We never really considered staying there because we thought the rooms would also be very old and smokey  Well we got an offer in the mail for three free night in ember and decided to check it out  I assured my wife that if the room was a dump we would leave immediately  We specifically asked for a Tower room and were assured that we would get one  not one of the  quot old quot  rooms   When we checked in we were given room     in the Tower  We went up to the room a bit apprehensive  We got off on the  th floor to find new carpeting in the hallway and everything very clean  We opened the door to our room and were shocked  The room was clean as a whistle with new carpeting  drapes and furnishings  It was much nicer than we thought it would be  The bathroom is a bit small but the room was good size  We were very pleased with our room  I cannot attest to the old rooms  but the tower rooms  while not the Bellagio  are better than the rooms at the Plaza  the Vegas Club and the Lady Luck  We would definately stay at the EC again The only problem we found with the room is that the hot water is VERY hot  Be careful in turning it on  
N =>  love the el cortez spent last  yrs  at this resort   we go theretwice a year  Great food great prices  but most of all great machines   great tower rooms  fiendly a homelike atmosphere  when we go to vegas we go to play and they give you nice comp  if you want to sightsee then you go to the strip but if you want good machines  fiendly local atmospere  and a good time gambling   go to the el cortez we love it  
N =>  Clean Family Run Hotel Casino Overall a clean hotel to stay in with security  a ride to the airport  Even a coupon to come back for a free nights stay  Was quiet and rooms where a little outdated but really clean  They took pride in that  Cable was not so hot  But a c worked fine  One of the older casino  but none the less great in what it had to offer for the price  Would stay there again  Could use internet service  
N =>  Our First Experience at the El Cortez My husband and I were researching in the downtown area around Fremont for a review article We went to the El Cortez upstairs where I went into the ladies room My husband stayed about    feet away at a bank of slot machines On my machine was a coke and my purse He was sitting at the next machine guarding my things A male waiter came over told him to remove my purse from off of the slot so my husband reached over to move the purse but not before the employee grabbed for it also My drink spilled all over my husband I returned just as all this happened My husband was upset so we went downstairs and he sat at a blackjack table A heavy set pit boss denied him from ordering a drink and called Security on him We left Not going back there  
N =>  Great Slots I thought the El Cortez was a nice hotel casino for the price  The rooms were clean enough and it wasn t very crowded  It took longer than expected to check in but after a long flight I might have beeneager to get to bed    We arrived at      am  We plan on going back to Vegas and we ll alwaysconsider the El Cortez  
N =>  much better than expected I wanted a room with a jacuzzi   afer our new york new york plans fell through   no money  we had to find somewhere we could afford  first off the room was        a night for a suite we expected a small room but some where we could celebrate alone  well we were blown away  the room was gigantic and very beautifully decorated  it could easily be compared to the higher priced strip hotels  beleive me i have been there  but it was quit and pleasant  and close to the fremont street expierence   we will be staying there again   
N => Better than expected  I must say that after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor I was expecting to check into a different hotel after one night at the El Cortez  but I was impressed with the room and it was actually an okay place to stay  The room was clean  a bit sparse  but for the price well worth it  I was a bit concerned about the security warning regarding walking to the parking lot  but the valet service took care of that problem  No problem walking down to the main area of Fremont for gambling  and as for gambling at the El Cortez it was okay  The clientel was mainly from the senior circuit but other than that it was a positive experience with the affordable table rates  Overall a thumbs up experience   
N =>  Was just fine We enjoyed our stay  room was comfortable  food was fine  staff was great  Will stay there again  
N =>  Poor customer service Hotel desk persons not very helpful  very young and inexperienced  reminded me of a fast food restuerant  Failed to inform me that I needed to leave a        deposit or open credit card for phone calls  Informing me of this policy at checkin would have saved me a trip to the front dest when I tried to make a local call  Desk clerk didn t even tell me how to get to room from parking garage  Too many good deals to be had in Las Vegas to be wasting your time on this place  
N =>  Worst Hotel ever   You get what you pay for  I wanted to stay here because of the history behind the hotel  Got a good deal on the room also  From the minute I walked into the hotel  it was terrible  There was not a single security person anywhere  the desk clerk was rude and couldn t even tell us how to get to our room  Had to ask several employees where our room was  Not a single person had a clue  The room was big  but the beds were box springs  The hotel was very unsafe  again  NO SECURITY seen anywhere    Had to call   seperate cab companies to pick us up to take us to the airport  Not a single one would come becuase of the neighborhood etc  Got lucky and had a cab drop some one off  had to beg them to take us to the airport  Would not reccomend to anyone to stay  Spend the extra money and stay on the srip  
N =>  Cancer Capitol From the time I walked into El Cortez I thought I was going to get lung cancer because of all the smoke  I was in there for about   minutes to check in and I came out smelling like an ash tray  The room was nice  but the cigarette smoke was a major problem  If you have any kind of respiratory problems or care about about your health  stay away from EL CORTEZ aka THE SMOKE OUT   
N => Pleasant vacationing  NOT   
N =>   Ne cherchez pas plus loin  
N => Embassy Suites The staff was very friendly and helpful  The breakfast was one of the best I ve had at a hotel  I did not get to attend the evening reception because I was working  but from what I saw it looked friendly and inviting  I will stay here next time I travel to Vegas  
N =>   Super trip It was a lot of fun  we visited every hotel and every casino  We went to the Cirque du Soleil Show  O which was a very amazing experience  I totally recommend it to everyone who visits Las Vegas  
N =>   Don t expect   star and you won t be disappointed I generally stay here when visiting Vegas It is a no gambling property   no clanking of slots Breakfast includedOpen bar  quot Free quot  included during happy hourThe property is older and honestly not very attractive but the pricing reflects this The fitness center is the minimum necessaryThe pool is OK but not fancyThe money you will save staying here will more than cover the cost of cab fare to wherever you want to go  
N =>   Very nice great breakfast  Breakfast   made to order  amp  hotService   greatNot a slot machine to be seen in the hotel   nice Near convention ctr but not so near to the strip  amp  casino s 
N =>   Peaceful in Vegas This Embassy Suites hotel was a peaceful and very pleasant refuge from the craziness that is Vegas  We re not big Vegas fans  which is why we chose a non gaming hotel  This Embassy Suites is very nicely decorated and kept  The pool was clean and in a very attractive setting  Happy hour was okay although they don t provide many drink choices for kids and they are not allowed to order for themselves  Breakfast was very good  nice selection  The location was a bit far from the strip however the hotel does have a shuttle service and we recomend you use it  The front desk advised us not to walk to the strip but we didn t listen  It was a big mistake  it was so hot and not a great area to be walking in  Our teenagers enjoyed having Hard Rock cafe across the street  College was not in session while we were there so I have no insight as to what effect that would have on your stay  All said we enjoyed this hotel very much and it was probably the best thing about our Vegas trip  
N =>  Great For My Needs But some issues We are a frequest Hilton  Embassy Suites  guest and knew what to expect  We were excited because we wanted a room near the strip but off the strip and we rented one of the rooms on the top floor with the huge balcony  Upon checking in half the funature was no on the balcony  We did like still having another balcony off the bedroom also  was very small couldn t sit on it   The huge one was great for entertainment once they replaced the furnature  they took it from the  th floor balcony  They didn t clean our room one day and insisted we had the DND sign on the door  the funny thing is we never had one  we kept asking for one too   So they brought it put it on the door and someone stole it after the mades did their cleaning  ok if they insist  and I m sorry would of been nicer   One other huge problem was the connecting door to the room next door although it had a deadlock was able to be pushed open  My    year old went into the room herself and some man was trying to get in  Turned out he just moved into the room next door and was trying to see what he door was  The issue I had with them is they tried to say he couldn t get in due to the deadlock  but we could see him he could stick his hand in  NOT GOOD   FIX IT    We enjoyed out stay but until they fix that majo issue with the door we will nto return  
N =>   Can t believe it s Hilton Family I fully agree with some of the comments that staff are rude in this hotel  the receptionist with name tag of Ashley is horrible  I have never met any hotel staff with such manner  I really don t understand why she is so bad to customer when we just arrived and wanted to check in  It s not just impolite or inexperience  she seems to hate doing her job and show bad face to us  We visited many hotels every year and this is absolutely the worst I ve ever come across in the past twenty years  
N =>  Goodclean hotel  WE stayed at this hotel in ember for   nights for our wedding Good clean rooms   did move on the first night due to being too near to atrium bar  but this was not a problem Great breakfast free internet with free printers especially helpful to print off boarding passes When we stayed it was extremely busy but we just got up a little earlier to avoid the lines As stated before   mins from shuttle station and five mins by taxi to a huge shopping mall which is off strip so cheaper Had no problems getting around either walking or by taxi The big strip hotels are huge fancy but a little impersonal but this one is great value for money and only a little out of the way  
N =>   Very comfortable After deciding to brave Las Vegas at Thanksgiving with kids  we used all our Hilton Hotel points to stay at Embasy Suites for four nights  I honestly have nothing bad to say about this hotel  It s off strip  non smoking  and quiet  except for the kids running around at breakfast   The hotel offers a free buffet breakfast  which was pretty good  hot  and with a lot of variety  There was a huge line the day after Thanksgiving  but I think everone wanted to get out to go shopping  The pool was clean and fun  just with a bit too much chlorine  The beds were comfortable  the staff was friendly  and the room was clean  I loved the bath soap  too  We were about   mile from the strip  but there were still a few casinos within walking distance  in case the gambling bug strikes  Also  the LV Monorail is just a   minute walk  and it s a great  safe and clean way to get to the strip if you don t have a car  There was always a cab sitting outside the hotel  too  If you re going to visit Las Vegas  this a great choice for an off strip hotel  The only glitch we experienced was that my mom stayed with the four of us  and has a bad back  We had asked for a rollaway for the room instead of her using the pull out couch   and I called a few times during the week prior to our arrival to confirm it  When we arrived at   pm  there was no rollaway and we were informed that it is Embassy Suites policy not to allow rollaways in rooms with two beds and a pull out couch  due to space and fire hazard issues  I am okay with all of that  but just wish I had known before arriving    
N =>   Wonderful Stay We chose this hotel to be off strip since we were traveling with teens to the Nascar race  Our suite with   double beds and a sofa bed was more spacious than we expected and worked wonderfully for the family to spread out a bit  The breakfast was among the best we ve had at any Embassy Suites and the evening manager s reception included such things as chili cheese fries and nachos in addition to the standard snack mix  Even though the hotel was sold out for the five nights of our stay  we never encountered any problem with parking availability for our rental car  The location was great for us  If we wanted to do something on the strip  it was a   minute drive  but it was nice to be away from the hubbub  The business center with it s two computers was great for checking email and checking in for our flights  
N =>  Beware  Nice hotel but you may be stuck there My husband  amp  I stayed here for a convention at the Sands Convention Ctr                The suites are very nice   spacious  clean  with comfy beds  good sized fridge    TV s  Free Breakfast is quite good    yummy omlets  Free cocktails from      to      can be a zoo  but the bartender pours well and is a good guy  Staff was pleasant  although it took some nagging to check in early    they didn t seem to be jumping through any hoops to get me a room earlier than  pm check in time  Our problem is getting out of the hotel  Monorail is over   loooooong blocks away  and it drops you off way in the back of only a few hotels  Walking to the Sands conv  center is a loooong     mile  Trying to get a cab to pick us up on Friday nite proved impossible  We ended up eating in the hotel restaurant    not by choice  but it was actually pretty good  Other guests reported similar frustrations getting to the Strip  Missed dinner reservation due to lack of cabs  I love to walk and am in pretty good shape  but Vegas demands a lot of walking anyway  and my feet got tired enough from walking the strip  Fashion Show Mall  etc  Cabs at other times of the day are available  There seemed to be a lot of families with kids there for gymnastics or cheerleadingtournaments    a fine hotel if you are not going to do stuff on the strip  or are staying mid week  
N =>  Surprised I was a little leary coming to this hotel after some of the reviews I read  and honestly only picked this place because I wanted my Hilton Honor Points  When I pulled up to the hotel  I was even more leary     the exterior is quite  quot    s quot  and I was afraid the interior would be as well  I was pleasantly surprised to see the place has been completely remodeled  New furniture  carpet  and granite countertops to boot  My room was a spacious two room suite with a kitchenette  The other benefit was they have their own parking lot  so I didn t have to walk three blocks or valet park to get to the hotel  Free drinks at the evening reception were a plus as well  This great place to stay if you don t mind being a little ways off the strip  
N => Best non casino hotel This hotel cannot be beat   Near the action right next to convention center  but not too near We just got home  E Suites was a relief being off the strip  Things are much quieter  We had a mondo view from our room and huge balcony with chaise loungers and a patio table and chairs facing the monorail and golf course  This hotel sits behind Wynn   We slept like babies in the comfy king sized bed   I have stayed at many Embassy Suites  this one is tops The breakfast and manager s afternoon  free drinks snacks  was great  We loved it and it was nice not to be so guarded there unlike the strip with kids   Room was awesome down to the granite countertops sink tops  However  no free shuttle to strip  The only thing missing was jets in the tub   A  
N => If you want a great deal in a non casino hotel   this is it  We traveled with our son to Las Vegas for a week  Embassy Suites Convention Center was the perfect location   no noisy casino   great cook to order breakfast  our son was thrilled and he s picky eater   and a manager s reception that is a great way to begin an evening  The staff was very helpful  our room was great   no problems  We took the monorail to the strip   right down the street   that can get a little expensive for   people   but I m glad we did it  We had dinner there also  amp  that was very good  The pool and whirlpool were just right for us   not a lot of kids   indoor pool for when it was a little windy out  We had a taxi to the airport inside of   minutes   it was great  I highly recommend Embassy Suites Hotel Las Vegas Convention Center  Definitely would stay here again  
N =>  Ok      View was awesome great big balcony staying on the  rd top floor Close to the strip and easy to get cabs  Terrific breakfast included However our door kept not locking they did attempt to fix it twice but still felt uneasy  Also if you dont mind air conditioner noise being similiar to when you are on a plane then this place is not for you  Had to get earplugs because of it  
N =>  Disappointing Second time we have stayed  second time we have had problems  The air conditioners were non functioning which resulted in all air circulation being down Thursday thru Sunday  We were never apprised of the problem during check in  had to confront the issue with management after a very stuffy night  Relocating to another hotel was not an option as it was the opening weekend for the National Rodeo and hotels were packed  While management reduced the bill by one night for the inconvience  a hotel of this caliber should have a policy of alerting patrons of problems prior to check in  Am a regular guest at Embassy Suites but will avoid this one in the future  
N =>  Nice Place off the Strip This is great place to stay if you want to be close to but not on the Strip  I agree with the other reviewers that you need to have a rental car  or be willing to walk to the monorail stop  which is very close by  I also had a problem getting hot water  It seems to take a long time for the water to change from tepid to hot  On my second day  I started the water while I shaved  and the water was hot when I was ready to shower Staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is good  The fitness room was okay  but would be full with     people It is very easy to get to this hotel from the airport even during rush hour  
N =>  we will be back We got to las vegas and had a reservation elsewhere but the room didnt get reserved like it was supposed to have been this was when the american idol auditions were on and vegas was SOLD OUT luckily enough we called the embassy hotel and got a suite which we gratefully accepted and are we glad we did the hotel we were booked at was a one star  going cheap this trip lol When we go to the embassy the room was beautiful clean and comfy  We had a problem with the toilet and the desk people were on it in a heartbeat they were lovely to deal with  The monorail is a five minute walk away and we used it  next time we ll be renting scooters and just scootering back and forth  We have always stayed on the strip but we loved it here and will will definatly be back  
N =>  Good week at E S  We chose to stay at E S  since we were going to be in Vegas for a week and prefer a little more room  The rooms were clean  decorated nicely  had comfortable beds and fluffy towels  The cooked to order breakfast is a nice plus  Area was kept very clean  there were enough tables  food was attractive and well prepared  I would have liked a little more variety day to day  but there were really plenty of choices  This hotel has high speed internet access in the rooms and we were given the option of purchasing access for the week at a reduced rate  Nice  The business center was having some technical difficulties  but the staff at the desk was glad to help  and in fact faxed some things for me  Gloria was especially helpful  There was a problem with the door to our room  The desk clerk seemed to think it was operator error  but maintainence was called and a very nice man was able to fix the problem  batteries in the reader   We had a room facing the front which had very nice views of the Strip and mountains  For business  this is a very good choice  
N =>  Great place but too much trouble to get to the Strip We just returned from a   night stay here  It was a nice hotel  good sized rooms  and yes  a GREAT breakfast  complete with a friendly singing chef  However  if your intention is to come here and  quot run over quot  to the Strip  think again  We had tickets to a show at   and spent an hour trying to get a taxi from this hotel  The front desk was very unresponsive  shrugging and saying that this is how it  quot always is quot   particularly on a Friday or Saturday night  They said they d call a taxi  but none came  The only ones we did see were dropping off people coming in from the airport  A group of us ended up in front of the hotel  competing for the rare cab that did show up  It was awkward having people vie for a taxi   We were here first we have tickets my aunt is waiting for us  blah  blah  blah  We ended up walking to the monorail  but it is not what you want to do when you are all dressed up and don t want to arrive all sweaty  The scene was repeated again on Saturday night  We finally went next door to the Best Western and THEIR staff got us a taxi  Next time  we will spend the extra money and stay on the Strip  The monorail is too far to walk at night  particularly in heels and if you are a woman  but is a good option if you don t mind walking a bit  This hotel needs to partner with their hotel neighbors and get a shuttle  We almost missed our plane today trying to get a taxi  It didn t work for us at all  which is a shame because everything else about the hotel was perfect  
N =>  Great rooms Bad Service Stayed at the Embassy Suites for a long weekend  We liked the hotel but found the services to be disappointing at best  Rooms were left unmade until   or   pm when we d left the room before     am  Was told by Guest Services that they were fully booked and would get to us after they finished the rooms that were empty    Huh      Unfortunate as the bedding was very nice  Wouldn t stay here again       
N =>  Nice choice off strip Just returned from four nights at the Embassy Suites  Convention Center  Room was quiet  clean  comfortable and spacious  Our room had a small balcony so I was able to get some fresh air  I always find that hotel rooms can be rather stale so I like to be able to open a window or slider  If you like fresh air ask for a balcony room as the others had windows that didn t open  Breakfast was fine  typical of this type of hotel  The free managers  cocktail hour was nice  Staff was helpful with directions and maps  This hotel is a little too far to walk to the Strip  We had a car and drove to one of the big casino hotels  parked our car and walked portions of the Strip  Unfortunately the monorail  which is just down the street  was not operational yet  This was our first stay at an Embassy Suites and we would definately consider staying at another one  
N =>   Nice non gaming respite  We enjoyed the restful nature of this non gaming hotel  It was only a couple of blocks from the strip but after a day of running arround is was a pleasure to return each afternoon to the quiet mesmorizing fountain atruim and our very clean  quiet  non smoking room  It was our first visit to Las Vegas so we had much to see and do  My husband attended a conference at the Riveria  which he was able to walked to each morning  My   year old loved our view of the strip as the lights came up each evening  The cooked to order breakfast was more that adequate each morning  it featured quick and healthy choices for all  My only complaint  I had to request more towels each day  there were   of us in the suite for   nights and only   sets of towels  and Sunday  our room was not cleaned until we had already returned from the day s activities  about   pm  The pool was small but not crowded and great for burning off extra  quot kid quot  energy from the long drive  
N => Not bad   but not the Ritz either  Overall  this was a decent hotel  The lobby is nicely done with an open atrium style  The cooked to order breakfast was ok  not dog food  but not gourmet either   We requested a room with a view of  quot the strip quot  and we got that  We also requested a non smoking room   but it smelled quite a bit of cigarette smoke  But the room was nicely furnished and decorated  The bathroom was essentially spotless  While a rare incident  I must tell you that the fire alarm went off at  AM  the hotel was crawling with kids competing in some baseball tournament  We suspect one or more of them are responsible for the alarm going off   Being an atrium style hotel   quot group psychology quot  set in  meaning that people walked out into the walkways on each floor and watched everyone on all the other floors standing around  No staff bothered to tell people to get out  stay put  or anything for that matter  They wouldn t even answer the front desk phone  where they were standing   we had a clear view of them from our room   People waited over       minutes before an announcement was made that it was a false alarm  Had it been a real fire  the results could have been tragic   But it was equally foolish for people to stand around their rooms when the fire alarm was going off also   Again  a rare incident  I would imagine   but not one that brings about a  quot warm  fuzzy feeling quot  on the part of how staff are viewed  
N => Excellent value This was the first time we have stayed in Embassy Suites accommodation but it won t be the last  The rooms were spacious and clean  General facilities were very good though the pool is a little on the small side  Complimentary breakfast is excellent  Staff very courteous and helpful  Location may not suit all   its off strip but only about a   min walk to the monorail if you chose not to use the complimentary shuttle  If you want to keep away from the hustle  amp  bustle of the Strip  consider this place  
N => Close to the convention center  
N =>  Very good choice  
N =>   super Alternative zu den Strip Hotels  
N =>   Pretty Pretty Good  Having stayed at the  other  Embassy Suites   years ago  I decided to stay at this one based on the pool as my family was coming on this business trip  My kids loved the pool  and I did find the staff at checkin  throughout the stay  and at departure to be more than accomodating  Although always a request  the van driver was our own persoanl limousine driver  Of course  i would tip the driver as much as a cab cost  but there was no wait and he picked up right on schedule at the convention center  As stated  this is always a request and not a guarantee of service The suite were standard compared to other Embassy Suites  Cooked to order breakfast service was surprisingly fast  fastest at Lake Buena Vista  FL Embassy Suites   but the back area seemed a little shallow compared to other ES  Dink service depended upon the night   long waits on Fri and Sat  and faster service on other nights Downside is this hotel is a long walk off the strip  but less than the other ES in Vegas  One side of the hotel does have planes passing  but this did not bother my family  it may for others  Whenever I go back to Vegas 
N =>   great place to stay We had a great service and enjoyed our stay  the front desk men were very helpful and gave us good advice on places to eat  Our non smoking room smelled like smoke and they sent someone right up to deodorize it  Breakfast was fantastic one of the best omlettes I ve ever had    the cooks are funny and work very hard so even though its complimentary we tipped them every morning  Our shuttle driver at night was also great  We had a great experience and are staying there again when we go out in afew weeks  Walking distance to Unlv and they have a shuttle to bring you to the airport and to the strip  The shuttle does end at      pm and it doesn t run to the airport between         I think so check  but all in all it was a nice quiet place to stay  The swans were an added bonus for the kids  
N =>   Desk staff could use some lessons on improving service We checked in around mid night  The hotel was very quiet  clean and I noticed they ve done alot of upgrades to the room which was very nice  However  it doesn t matter how nice your hotel is when the service is non existant  We arrived in Las Vegas from an International flight so needless to say  we d been traveling all day  Upon checking into the hotel we asked if there was some where on property that we could purchse milk for our infant who needed a bottle  Mind you  we didn t ask for free milk  we simply asked if there was a way we could purchase milk  You wouldn t think this would be a problem since this is a full service hotel and they have a gift shop  The security guard at the desk said he would look but immediately followed that up with  quot There is a CVS down the street quot   Needless to say  no one tried to get milk for a screaming infant as a matter of fact they had the audicity to tell us they did try but we watched from the balcany as the desk clerk and security guy continued their conversation  When I went to the desk again they told me I would have to go to CVS and resumed their conversation as though I had imposed  I ve received better service from Super    
N =>   BED BUGS YUCK I work for a major sports television agency  the big one and our travel office booked here  First night they overbooked the hotel so sent us down to a nicer embassy but told us because our contract was there we had to come back  Upon return then next day  we had to wait until  p m  to check in  The Latino girl who was the manager checked us in  and was as caring as a wet blanket  She seemed to be frustrated about something  We proceeded to the room which had a odd odor  me and my colleague were running late so time to call in and complain  When we returned  later to the hotel  the young lady behind the desk  a little over weight  was chatting with some guy very cozy like  I hope it was not a guest or a personal friend  Any on to the BED BUGS  i took a shower  water took forever to heat up  and got ready to dive into bed and as i pull back covers  i notice dirty sheets and something moving  Called down to desk and phone just rang  upon me coming downstairs i notice same guy being cozy with desk clerk  I ask for another room and explain why and young girl tells me she is sold out  She only had a smoking room  i took that and checked out of that place first thing in the a m   BEWARE FELLOW TRVLRS  HORRIBLE PLACE  STAFF AND CRITTERS 
N =>  Good but Not a   Value Choice For Vegas I stayed here out of team comradarie  others wanted to accumulate Hilton points  and usually stay off the strip but at another hotel  The Orleans   The breakfast was really good and the manager s reception was better than most Embassy s I ve stayed at recently  this place had cheese queso and fresh chips rather than year old pretzels   The location in combination with on going road work make it a pain to get to from  but it s nice to be able to walk across the street to the Hard Rock  The Hofbreau House is also within easy walking distance  and that place is an interesting meal and entertainment combination  once   maybe more if you really like accordian music  If you re staying off the Strip  I expect to be able to get a plethora of channel selections on my tv   not here  Found it ironic that for a supposed  quot family friendly quot  hotel in Vegas  the Disney Channel got  quot no signal quot  when you stepped across it Really nothing bad to say about the place  but when you can easily get a really nice room in Vegas for around     a night  paying       for a standard Embassy Suites just isn t a great value  
N =>  Excellent value off strip hotel Pros  Very nice hotel  curteous staff  clean and nice room  Complimentary beverages  including some alcoholic   beer     pm     pm Complimentary cook to order breakfast  including pancake French toast omlette hash brown   more  Yum    Pull out sofa bed    Flatscreen TVs  Coi and Geese make your kids happy  Free wifiCons  Off strip  can t walk to strip  it s pretty far  but it s right behind Hard Rock hotel if you really want to gamble with walking distance  Some airplanes noise which can be heard  not too loud though fortunately they don t fly at night  so you will still get a good night of sleep  Small   double beds  You can t really fit   persons in a bed comfortably  
N =>  Perfect stay at Embassy Suites   Booked Embassy Suites through Hilton Honors as a free night After waying up the other Hilton options to use up our points  we decided as it was our first night in Las Vegas following a long flight  it would do the job we needed ie somewhere nice to sleep Turned out it was so much better than just that Firstly  we were able to self park directly outside the lobby  and were unpacking within minutes  very efficient  The room was exactly as we requested  a high floor  non smoking  room with strip view  Perfect   The complimentary beverages and snacks served in Coconuts Lounge     pm       pm were appreciated  The complimentary breakfast is fully cooked to order every morning in the atrium  a lovely setting We were delighted to see all the fish  and the Royal Swans  also in the atrium  they are named Elvis and Priscilla The food in the Three Palms Cafe was also very good  as was the service We were wondering if we would find Swenson Street easily  in fact  it is just around the block from Hard Rock  so no problem at all  Very happy with our choice to stay at Embassy Suites  spotlessly clean  and everything we wanted  Will definitely stay again  even if we have to pay     
N =>  Great Location Sweet Breakfast We had to use up some miles  so we decided to stay in this hotel based on some reviews  The location wasn t far from the strip  but it s probably too far to walk   unless you just really like walking  we did try it once  They offer a shuttle  but the times aren t terribly convenient  It runs every hour  but it starts late enough and stops early enough that you just don t get enough use out of it  and you ll want to take a cab most times  The times you may make use of it are when you come back to the room mid day and want to go back to the strip for a show or something You will be able to take advantage of the included breakfast and the manager s reception  but what you can t do are gamble at the hotel  have to go to a casino for that   and though they have a pool  there isn t really much to see while you do it   you re out in the middle of the parking lot  So if you want to sunbathe  you might want to pick another joint Other than that  the hotel works fine as a base of operations  It s just not the most scenic place in the city  
N =>   Not Expecting Airplane Roaring Overhead ProFriendly front desk personnelThe breakfast cooks were awesome and very entertaining ConHousekeeping needs a little work  took some dirty towels and tub mat  but didn t leave replacements  and need to pay attention to some of the small things that customers should not have to worry about  like running out of toilet paper  Front desk proudly mentioned the  quot heated quot  pool with a waterfall  We happend to hit a Vegas cold spell  but the pool was not heated  All the patrons around the pool complained about the ice cold water temperature Hotel web site described  quot up scale hotel completed a multi million dollar renovation in      quot   this place does NOT look like it s been renovated in the past two years and really does not look up scale Big NegativeAbsolutely NO mention warning of airplane noise  I realize that they re designated as the Embassy Suites Las Vegas  quot Airport quot   but I ve had stays at hotels at the actual airport or connected property  but did not have this problem  Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport  Hilton Boston Logan Airport   If you re in a room facing Swenson  then prepare for noise and the room rattling  You re right below the flight line of the airplanes  I recommend requesting a room on the Paradise road side to minimize the noise  Location is not the fault of the hotel staff  but I did request a quiet room and the person checking us in did make it a point that he was assigning us to a quiet room  I m shocked that they would put us in this room  
N =>   Fantastic Service We recieved great service at this hotel   We traveled from the Grand Canyon back to Las Vegas to fly home We were allowed to check in early and the front desk could not have been more accomodating   The room was neat and clean with   TV s   a plus if you are traveling with children   there was a pool  and no casino  We ate at the hotel and the staff was friendly and went out of their way to help us   Great price for great service    
N =>   fantastic stay We stayed here from  nd to  th of march and had a wonderful time friendly helpful staff clean comfortable room  as we have found from all embassy suites that we have stayed in  Would definitely stay here if we come back to vegas 
N =>   great value  excellent value because of the  quot happy hour quot  which I enjoyed immensely and the breakfast buffet   rooms were large and clean  not to mention well stocked    I would recommend this hotel to the value conscious traveler   Plus  it was less smoky than most Vegas hotels  
N =>   Enjoyed our stay We stayed for almost a week  part business  amp  the rest pleasure  Hotel staff was very accomodating with every request  Shuttle was usually available to take us where we wanted to go  Breakfast was a perfect selection of fresh food  Pool area was enjoyable  the waterfall was very relaxing and towels were plentiful Peaceful to come back to the hotel at night since it was away from the hustle  amp  bustle of the Strip  The Hard Rock Hotel  amp  Casino is just a walk across the street if so desired  Overall we enjoyed our stay  
N =>   Good value at the Embassy We were going to Vegas to celebrate a  quot big quot  birthday and were going to stay in a strip hotel  However  after considering all things  we opted for the Embassy Suites and made the right decision  We based our decision on the following     We like to be able to park our car and not walk through a casino to our room     We are big breakfast eaters and like to return to our room following breakfast  The breakfast at the ES offered anything a restaurant would and it was so convenient They even had Starbucks coffee    My husband likes to work out and the gym workout rooms at the big casino hotels charge a per diem of           while the ES gym was nicely equipped and free    The social hour was a nice  quot extra quot   although we weren t always there at that time  The staff was very nice and friendly and the location couldn t be beat  I was a little worried when we first checked in because the ES was right in the flight path for most of the airlines  However  surprisingly  you weren t all that aware of it once in your room  We would definitely stay here again     
N =>  Bed Bugs Are In This Hotel    BED BUGS   DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL  I WOKE UP WITH LITERALLY    BED BUG BITES ON ME  I WAS IN ROOM     I DEMANDED MY ROOM BE COMPEDThe front desk reps acted like it was no big deal  I went to a skin doctor when I came back home and she confirmed they were bed bug bites             
N =>  Great Accomodations but Unbelievably Great Staff When I booked my vacation   Embassy Suites was     in Vegas on Tripadvisor  it is now     and I can DEFINITELY see why  Other hotels can have all the amenities they want  at this property  the staff are unlike any others I have every came across  and I work in the business Greeted when we walked in with a smile  William  Front Desk Supervisor  was incredibly helpful not only with getting us checked in promptly  but with our questions of the nearest casino  shuttle services  the resort ammenities  He was a dream employee  I kid you not  and Embassy Suites should be thankful they have someone like him Next was our room  located on the  th floor  newly renovated from what William told us   This room had everything we needed and a very nice layout  Two large flat screen TV s  microwave  kitchen sink  refrigerator  if we were staying longer than we were    nights  we could have made our breakfasts   but wait   they were free We didn t take advantage of the complimentary hot breakfast the first day  however the second we did  And like I read on another review  these guys wowed us  Although there was a line up  it went fast  and the chefs    of them  were very quick and extremely accommodating to all requests I noticed in the line Managers Hour was for a few hours in the evening and included some appetizers  as well as free drinks  What a treat  A great way to start the evening off in my opinion  which is what we did both nights we were there  Finally  I have to mention the staff again  They REALLY do make a difference in your stay  Ralph  the hotel Ambassador  never left the lobby floor when people were around  and you could see him constantly speaking to guests and I can tell you that he spoke to us on many occasions just to make sure all was going ok and to make small talk  an incredible  incredible way to make someone feel welcome and at home  The shuttle drivers were also incredible helpful  What I thought were set schedules to and from the strip and airport  became  where do you want to go   and  I can pick you up after   as we took advantage of their wonderful services  I tipped as much as a cab would have taken I m sure  but in my opinion  these guys were worth it Overall  I must say  it was one of the most memorable stays I ve every had  And I would recommend and re recommend this property as a choice place to stay in Vegas  even if it is a few minutes off the strip  
N =>   Just your average hotel     In another city  a smaller one   this hotel would probably receive a better rating from me  This hotel just cannot compare to magnificant hotels in Vegas  The room was just your standard room  but no pay per view  The rooms do have microwaves  refrigerators  and free wifi  Although newly remodeled  it was still just okay  The shuttle  although free  was not that reliable  In fact  we called from the strip to get a ride back and the person could not tell me where to meet the shuttle  The breakfast and manager s reception are a huge plus  The concrete around the pool is extremely slippery  So if you have kids  use caution  The elevators are  really  slow  Walking distance to a variety of restaurants  Overall it was just your average hotel  nothing wrong   nothing extremely exciting  I stayed at this hotel for a class  otherwise I would have been on the strip  
N =>   Fantastic  For our first trip to Vegas  the Embassy Suites on Swenson was wonderful  The hotel was quiet and very clean  The free made to order breakfast was great  I do recommend getting in line early  though     But it must be said that every last patron was served even if the hours of operation had been surpassed  The manager  Gina  was superb  She helped us with directions and all the staff were friendly and more than willing to be of service  Their shuttle to the Strip does end early       pm  but it s not far if you need to take a cab  The hotel is within safe walking distance to the Hard Rock Cafe and Casino  a must visit   We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and often comment that when we go back  we d stay at the Embassy Suites again  
N =>   Great hotel for being off strip We stayed at the Embassy Suites on Swenson     thru       Check in was easy  we arrived at      am  and although our room wasn t ready  they checked our bags and we wandered over to the Hard Rock  Came back in a couple hours and our room was ready  The room was great  nice sized suite  very clean and comfy The breakfast was awesome  great way to start your day in Vegas  They have a shuttle running every hour to the strip  The only bad thing about that is that the last pick up of the night from the strip is      pm  so we had to take a taxi back in the evenings  But the taxi was only about     so not bad  They also have another shuttle that runs to the airport  Very convenient Overall  I d recommend staying here if you don t mind being off the strip  
N =>   Great stay   AWESOME breakfast My wife and I loved this hotel  Though we were only there for   days  it was a great experience  First  although check in wasn t until   pm  when we pulled in at    am  there was no problem checking us in early  We then went to the pool  while it was still warm  The pool was very clean and because of the time of day  it was relatively quiet  There were also several smaller spas surrounding the pool  some semi secluded  some open  The rooms were very nice and clean  The best was the breakfast  There was made to order omellettes  pancakes  french toast  hashbrowns  plus all the regular continental breakfast stuff  It was soooo wonderful  I still fondly remember it and tell everyone about it when I discuss our trip  All in all  a great trip  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  This trip we didn t take our kids  but I would definitely considering staying here with them next time  
N =>  Great start of the Honeymoon After a long flight we arrived about   hours later than planned in Vegas to start our honeymoon  I was greeted with my last name by the clerk when I entered the lobby  they had a suite on the  th floor with  quot strip view quot  reserved for us  the view was actually really good  Mandalay Bay  Luxor  Hard Rock blocked of a bit but you could se the top of Paris  Bally s  Wynn  the Platinum  and of course Terribles The suite was nicely decorated and newly renovated  nice flat screen TV s in both living room and bedroom  nice sofa and one of the best hotel beds we ever slept in  The fridge was big plus for us  always nice to have cold beverages of choice within in reach  The bathroom was a bit on the small side but served it purpose well Location was very good  The Strip just minutes away with a car  cab fare about      tip  Lot of shops and store at yland Parkway also just minutes away  close to the airport The pool was nicer than expected  towels provided  lot of chairs  Breakfast was really good  omelettes made to order  cereal  bread and fresh fruit  Manager s reception at   pm was pretty nice  free beer  wine and drinks but a bit rowdy        yrs old Americans taking advantage of free beer  wine and booze  lol  Only bad thing to remark was that our room was close to the elevator  but that s all to complain about  Will I stay here again  YES  if I ever go back to Vegas  
N =>   Great accomadations My husband and I stayed here on for our first trip to Veags  The hotel offers a free shuttle service every hour to the Planet Hollywood hotel on the strip and will take you to the airport when you checkout  However  they do not pick you up from the airport when you arrive  Rooms were cozy and clean  Breakfeast was very good  and free  Staff was friendly and was willing to answer questions  We would stay here again  
N => Oasis  We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel  We were four people and we would all stay here again  The atmoshphere was friendly and relaxing Hard to believe you get a complimentary cocktail hour and full serve breakfast   and the cooks at breakfast were so nice This is a hotel that says  quot Hello  we are very glad to have your business  quot  I also appreciated an email from them asking us how our stay was be we were just lucky  but we never heard an airplane in our rooms  Nice pool too We actually enjoyed our stay here and felt much more welcomed here than at the end of our vacation when we stayed at the Bellagio  
N => Embassy Suites was Awesome           We stayed here   nights  and we were very impressed with this hotel   We didnt hear a single plane during our stay  so the airport being nearby didnt matter  The staff was always friendly and went out of the way if you needed anything   As always the breakfast was awesome   The kitchen staff was humerous and paid attention to detail  We stay at Embassy Suites on a regular basis   and this one met our every expectation   We highly reccomend this location if you want to be close to the Vegas action  but stay where its quiet at the end of your day  We will return to this location on our next stay in Vegas  
N =>  Nice stay The complimetary happy hour  amp  made to order breakfast was wonderful  A bigger variety of food offered than I expected for breakfast    Lovely atrium     It was fun to look at the swans  Elvis  amp  Priscilla  Friendly staff minus one person      Nice rooms    Quiet place    My only area of improvement to the hotel would be for the shuttle to the strip to run a little longer than the       pm cut off  But you can always take a cab back to the hotel      Be weary of the cab drivers     Some of them will try to get over  amp  take the long way to keep that meter running  
N =>  nd time here and all was wonderful  We did four nights here in      and it worked out wonderfully  so we decided to stay here again for our shorter visit in ember  We arrived early because we had to be out of the Rio by        but we had no problems checking in early  and our room was exactly as requested   high floor  near an elevator  king bed  The staff is very helpful  even when we couldn t find the high speed internet connection that was right under the desk  The managers reception is a lot of fun  and the bartender  Day  remembered us from our last visit  over   months ago  The free breakfast can t be beat  and is better than a lot of the buffets we have been to  They offer a free shuttle to the strip  so you almost could get away without having a car  All in all  I highly reccomend the Embassy on Swenson  We will be back again  
N => Close to everything and staff was wonderful  We stayed during Christmas week  As luck would have it  the Cal Band was also staying during that time to participate in a bowl game  My wife and I were worried a bit about the potential of young folks being wild and crazy all night  Our worries were for naught and it turned out to be a great stay We liked the fact that we were close enough to everything  but still had a restaurant if we decided to just hang out  The interior is nice  and the swans that inhabit the pond are delightful The only challenge that I had was that I couldn t get the internet on my laptop to work during this trip  To the staff s credit  they did make every effort though to get it right and offered to change rooms to one that would  We decided we didn t need access to the net and went about the business of getting married and seeing a few shows I would come back here for a second visit if I were in Vegas  
N =>  Good hotel

N =>  What A Great Place To Stay   
N =>  Suite place to stay   
N => A Good Place T Stay  
N =>   Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in  I recently stayed at the hotel the Emerald Suites on South Las Vegas Blvd for   days due to a conference I was attending  Let me say this as politely as I can    the place was a dump  I am not opposed to staying at   or even   star hotels  but this one is one of the worst places I have ever stayed in my life  More than anything it was the hotel staff and the management that caused all the problems  Let me first tell you that I had several problems with my room and I called down to the front desk SEVERAL times to ask for help  to no avail  FINALLY  I sent an email to the office stating what I felt were the issues in the room  Let me share those with you     First of all with   floors I expected there to be an elevator  I have had knee surgery and have a difficult time climbing stairs  Much to my surprise  not only is there no elevator  but my room is on the  rd floor  I was supposed to stay for   days  and I had more luggage than the usual overnight bag  It took me   trips up and down stairs to bring all of my items to my room  You need to put that on your website that there is NO ELEVATOR      I walked into the room and the musty smell was overwhelming       There is a huge hole in the door frame where it looks like a lock or sliding chain was ripped off the wall      They promised on their site Free High Speed Internet Access in the rooms  but mine NEVER worked  It wasn t my computer because the conference where I was attending in another hotel worked there just fine      Where the cables for the tv should be was a huge hole with wires and cables protruding and that is where I was supposed to plug into the internet access  which did not work       The remote in the bedroom did not work for   days  I kept calling the front desk and no one came to fix it  It was on the  th day that a Security office came and just swapped remotes with a new one that worked  I can t believe it took   days for that to happen      The tub did not drain and I stood in water up to my ankles every morning while trying to shower      The bedspreads are NO LESS than    years old and smell old and musty       Both beds in the room had broken frames and or box springs  The one I had been sleeping on  the better of the two  was uncomfortable and painful       The third day into my stay I came back to the hotel after a long day of conferences only to walk up the   flights of stairs to find out that my key no longer worked  I had to walk all the way to the front desk  carrying my computer and briefcase  I didn t DARE leave it by my door  to get them to reprogram my key       I had to call twice as two lights have burned out during my stay       The bathroom light didn t even have a cover and the light bulb is just hanging down by a wire       I had been woken up no less than   nights in a row by the people in a neighbooring room have been having knock down brawls and screaming matches When I sent my list of issues to the Manager  she called me  quot a miserable human being whom no one could obviously please quot   When I asked her why the things in the room were even like that before someone checked in she said   quot you have to expect wear and tear in the rooms quot  Here is my recommendation    if you want a cheap hotel  stay at Circus Circus  At least you will have clean sheets and the lights and internet will work  If you want to stay in a dump    by all means    Stay at the Emerald Suites Hotel  
N =>   Excellent Hotel A Great place to stay My stay at Emerald suites in Las Vegas was wonderful The rooms were clean and comfortable  the staff was great I plan to stay there every time I visit Las Vegas  I will refer this hotel to my friends  
N =>   hotel review we only spent one night in this hotel but we were pleasantly surprised at all the great amenities   including the mini kitchen and hospitality given to us Our short stay had us planning another trip to this hotel before we left  OC 
N =>   Pet Friendly this was a great hotel if you have pets  however  they do try to charge you a    dollar pet fee   we were able to get it waived  but otherwise it probably wouldnt have been worth staying  there is a nice middle courtyard with grass  dirt and pebbles which is very dog friendly  lots of other residents had dogs as well  otherwise  good service  decent place  especially for the price we paid  
N =>   CLEAN QUIET CONVENIANT We truly love this hotel  It is very clean  The rooms are suites so you have a whole kitchen to work with  Right across the street from the Orleans Casino  which made it a lot easier for us  The hotel is located about       miles away from all the action on the strip  we liked this because you are not to close but not too far either  The staff was very pleasent  and helpful  We will be back soon  
N =>   Excellent Choice We Made We went to Las Vegas for a weekend during the Labor Day Weekend       Prior to selecting this hotel  I went through an extensive list of hotels  Other hotels were too expensive for my budget and the reviews on most were horrible Emerald Suites did not disappoint  The staff was extremely pleasant and eager to assist  The room was extremely nice  i e  clean  spacious  kitchen area  i e    We truly look forward to staying there again in the future  Thank you  
N =>  Good Stay Close to Strip  Minimarts etc  Suite Kitchen  free internet  online services menu  flatscreen TV plus one in bedroom  Clean rooms and helpful staff  I visit my Dad retired in LV  coming from DC  both my wife and I and other relatives have had good experiences staying here  No slots to wade through  Have seen the bad reviews but don t guess we ve been lucky so far with this place  
N =>   Don t stay here       WELL   It was the worst stay i have ever had at any hotel  First we were booked for a two room sutie and when we arrvied was told that their was none  so  then they put us in a handicap room   Then to top the stay off we had bought a feather down to sleep on the nasty beds and guess what  when we returned it was gone    plz this is real  dont stay here                                     
N =>   More than just a bargain or your dollar I was looking for a good nights rest after lots of airport delay s etc and found Emerald suites to be everything I had hoped for and some  I wanted a clean comfortable room and Emerald Suites provided a little extra  next time I hope to stay longer Emerald Suites South Las Vegas  
N =>    star hotel We stayed here for an event with my daughter  The sales director and the check in people were very good to work with  The weekend staff not so much though it is across the street from the Orleans Casino so food was convenient  I was concerned about the location and the security The units appeared to be converted apartments and had an odd access to them  There were no elevators  so beware if you are handicapped We stayed in a   bedroom suite and the couch was pretty old and beat up  our bed worked fine  but others in our party were not so lucky  Our refrigerator worked as did our stove  but there was not cookware  The place could use some remodel work  but it was comfortable and the price was fine For our purposes it was an adequate place to stay  If I was in the room a lot  would probably not want to be there  But its Vegas and you are not there a lot anyways  so for an inexpensive place its not bad  Right now the casinos are offerering some amazing deals and would probably go that route  
N =>   Loved my stay at the Emerald Suites Loved my stay at this hotel  I would recommend this hotel to anyone making a trip to Las Vegas  It was very clean and the staff was very friendly  
N =>   last minute travel Room was nice  check in easy  however kitchen not a full kitchen  no dish towels  no hot pads  no large frying pans  no liquid dish soap  no paper towels  now tell me if this is a complete kitchen  If you are not ready for maid service they will not come back  so need to get your towels from them when they are there  Would not stay here again  would not recommend to anyone  Spoke to manager when i returned home  said they do not supply paper towels or dish soap  explain i can stay at a   star hotel with a kitchen and get the soap and paper towels  told her would not ever stay there again  she said will discuss with owners  Mind you this is a extended stay hotel  however you need to buy your own cleaning stuff  Also as a private owner of a spa in my home  I always check the chlorine level of any commerical pool and spa  Found that the spa did not have chlorine in it  the pool was fine  we told the front desk  said there was nothing they could do  This is a health hazard with no chlroine in spa  would not use the spa  was very disappointed  
N =>   Absolute B S   Looking for a quick stay in Las Vegas due to a summer cash shortage  we finally settled on Emerald Suites  Upon reaching the check in counter  I knew I was in for trouble  The incompetent lady at the front didn t say a word to us and handed us our keys  Upon opening the door  I was disappointed  Dirty green carpet clashed with filthy beige walls  The scent of cigarette butts mingled with horrible motel quality A C  There were large blood stains near and in the bedroom entrance and a cruddy  non working refrigerator  I was annoyed by the junky old television set  so we had to drive to my grandmother s house in Henderson to borrow one of their televisions  Acquiring the TV  we came back  and were still angry because of the shoddy  roach motel quality and the missing blinds   not to mention the bums and hoods who stomped on the stairs  ruining our sleep  Speaking of the beds the quality of ours was one grade up from a prison cot  with rough sheets    and bedbugs were abundant I believe we stayed here for two days    on the final day  I was thankful to check out and get back to my beloved Strip  We visited our favorite landmarks  shrugging off the filth Emerald Suites had left on us  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone  
N =>   Reasonable price for the weekend We flew out of L A  for a family wedding and decided not to shell out      a night to stay on the strip  This place was a great alternative  It was about   minutes from the strip  The suite was very comfortable  I had a great nights  sleep on their bed  The room came equipped with a plasma tv and was more than we expected  I would definitely go back  We stood there two nights and paid less than what one night on the strip would have cost  My only suggestion to the staff is to update the check out time on the back of the front door  The room says check out time is    pm but check out time is really    am and they make sure to correct you when you check out  
N =>  This place needs a good remodel My sister and I reserved a   bedroom suite  The furniture was in very bad shape  It looked as if someone had taken an axe to the top of the dresser  There were holes in the doors and the bedspread looked as if it were the original from    years ago  Very shabby  The bathroom area was also in need of repair  We went to the front desk and they offered us another room  which was just as bad  We were given a credit  but we had to find another place to stay  
N =>   I am supposed to fix your toilet for     night  We stayed at this hotel over New Year s eve  It was a last minute trip  and the only place available for less than     night  It was     for a suite that we shared between   people  I understand that it s NY eve in Vegas  all places are booked  so they charge an arm and a leg  Price is not an issue  What is an issue is that    minutes after we checked in   pm  the toilet overflowed  I did emergency handling of the situation by shutting off the water to the toilet and called the front desk to send some one over to clean up the mess  etc  The front desk guy told me to come down to the lobby  get a plunger and some towels  To add insult to injury  I was supposed to bring the plunger back immediately when i was done  I asked them if he was serious  to which he said the same thing again  So here I am  paying     night and having to fix the toilet myself  The only consolation I had was leaving a pile of wet paper towels as evenly spread around the carpet as I could get them  Never staying in this hell hole again  
N =>  Disappointing My wife and I have travelled extensively and were extremely disappointed with what we discovered on our arrival  The first thing was that the hotel was not on the strip  The information contained on the website   both the site I booked the accomodation and the hotel site indicate that hotel is on the strip  I quote in the section titled  quot What to Expect quot  it states the hotel is on the strip  I did notice in another section that it says south of the strip  Howeverwhen the taxi from the airport turned away from the strip we knew we were not going to be near the strip After booking in and going to our room   a non smoking room we found that the room smelt of smoke  This seems to be a common complaint with this hotel We went on to discover that there is no kettle to boil water for those who drink tea  no wine glasses for those who like to drink wine and and no ice cube tray in the freezer for those who prefer ice with their drinks We have never arrived in a hotel that does not provide any written information about the hotel  it s services  nearby services etc  I was amazed as this was our first visit to America and we were a little lacking in local information When my wife decided to do some washing in the laundry we found that there was no vending machine for laundry powder when she asked in reception she was told that there was laundry powder in the laundry She tried the shop next to the hotel and they did not have any  She eventually bought some from another guest On our first night in town we decided to go into the strip  The management told us that buses pas the hotel every    minutes  the first bus came about    minutes later and instead of taking us to the strip dropped us at the bus terminal and told us to catch another bus to the strip The next night we decided to catch a taxi to the strip  The hotel rang a taxi for us and due to the fact that we were south of the strip we were told it would be about    minutes The next day we were going on a tour departing at  am from the strip and when we asked the hotel to book a taxi for the next morning and were told taxi s do not take bookings  This concerned us due to our experience getting to the strip earlier that night and the fact that we had to be at the airport the following day at  am  Interestingly the website says that they have a shuttle service to the airport  Another non existent service from the hotel Considering that service is the key to a successful business the Emerald Suites have a lot to learn about providing information and services to their customers The only positive that I can give this hotel is that the rooms do come up t  expectations   except for the non smoking policy All we can say is that they need to lift their game and provide service and accurate information for their guests Dissappointed Aussies 
N =>  never again WE spent one night at the start of our vacation  Room smelled of smoke so bad it was hard to fall asleep  We had booked two rooms and asked for non smoking  We were given third floor rooms and had to drag the luggage up the stairs  Another man in the lobby was promissed a handicapped room and was told all that was available was the third floor  The place was budget at best  TV had no cable  When called they said they would bring one  they never did  We were just disappointed all round  Would NEVER stay here again  
N => Worst motel I ve ever stayed at Quite possibly the worst motel I ve ever stayed at With few exceptions  horrible staff  Manager was utterly apathetic about problems our conference attendees faced Examples of some of our problems Shuttle was supposed to pick us up at McCarran Airport  Insisted they had missed us  even though we had been waiting for    minutes from the pick up point  Called agiain  shuttle finally arrived  after an hour of waiting  and we were taken to the wrong hotel  No signs on the shuttle denoting which location they are going to  and the driver actually asked us if we wanted to go back to the airport Reservations had our check in dates wrong  even though we had confirmations with the correct date Facility has no elevators  so if you need handicap access  you better hope for a first floor unit All rooms  regardless of smoking or non designation  reeked of cigarette smoke  Furniture  linen and general state of rooms was extremely shabby  People are obviously using this place as an extended residence  as there is laundry hanging over the walkway fences  I could clearly see into my room through the one inch gap between the vertical blinds and the window sill I gouged my thigh on a mattress spring because they re too cheap to have decent bedding or replace the mattresses The walls are so thin  you can clearly hear the conversations  amoung other noises  in every room around you The shuttles are supposed to take you anywhere you want to go in Vegas  but in reality  most of the drivers hassle you if you ask to go anywhere other than Mandalay Bay or the airport  They are also supposed to pick you up       and instead will leave you stranded on the strip If you expect to have a meeting room where you need a network connectivity  make sure it s hooked up first  we discovered the Cat   cabling was acutally hanging in mid air on the other side of the wall of our room Don t expect to have rooms you reserved for meetings or appointments available either  the hotel sold ours right out from under us  leaving us looking like idiots in front of our interview candidates I cannot stress enough how you should definitely not stay at this motel  The staff is unhelpful  uninformed  and apathetic  
N => Very Cozy  I stayed at this hotel during the CES convention  I found the lobby to be quite nice and the clerk that was assisting me was very helpful and friendly  The landscaping was nice and it was quiet  I liked the location because it was close to the strip  but it was far enough away that I didn t get caught in all of the traffic  My room was cozy and relaxing  I love the kitchen and the full sized refrigerator  I was actually able to buy food and keep it in there  I was very happy to find that it came with pots and dishes so that I could cook and not have to eat junk food the whole time I was there  It was quiet and peaceful and I would definitely stay there again when I come back next year Rob  Joppa yland 
N =>  Wonderful alternative to the strip We stayed at here from     to       The rate was very good concidering we were there in Las Vegas for the CES convention  Almost all the other hotels were booked  So we decided to stay here  I am so glad that we did  It was like having a home away from home  The people here are very friendly  amp  are really conciderate  The nieghborhood was nice also  I felt safe walking around after dark  There is a    hour gas station  next door   amp  a    food mart a block away  The room was VERY clean  The bed was comfortable  All the appliances were in great working order  amp  clean  We are definately going to be making a return stay here this coming         They also had a shuttle bus that would get you to the beginning of the strip  So if you don t rent a car you can still get to the strip without the high prices of a taxi  
N =>  Cheap and Dirty Pros  Fairly close to strip  cheap  kitchenette was pretty nice Cons  Could feel springs pushing up through mattress  sheets didn t go to foot or head of bed   quot non smoking quot  room smelled like smoke  not surprising  since there were cigarette burns on the furniture  counter tops and carpet   couch was a joke  blood on the vertical blinds  no curtains   squeeky floors  generally dirty If I could do it over  I d pay another     or more per night to get a cleaner place  
N =>   average              been to better              been to worse The price was reasonable for the accomodations of a two bed room suite  The hotel was a little old  It smelled like smoke  Unfortuantely there was not wireless internet  but the hotel does provide the wire if you want to take advantage of the free internet option in the living room  There was no tvs in the bedrooms  only one in the living room  There was no elevators  which is bad for ppl like me who have a tendency to overpack  I guess the walss were thin  because I could heard all kinds of noises day and night  Great anmenities in the kitchen  full size refigerator  stove  microwave  toaster  dishwasher  dishes            It was in a nice area  with lots of eating places nearby  Not that long of a drive from the strip  The hotel was ok  It all depends on your personal taste  I like fancy hotels  but I would consider this hotel again for my next trip to Vegas  
N =>   Airline cancellation nightmare turned into a pleasant stay at the Emerald Suites Cameron AA initially overbooked and then had mechanical problems  The entire flight was cancelled  so everyone had to be rebooked and put up until the next available flights  They were so overbooked that they couldn t get me out for two days  I was extremely frustrated    On top of that they selected a hotel that I believed would be far below my standards  During my stay in Vegas  I stayed at the LUXOR  which was horrible due to an incident allowed by management at their club  quot Cathouse quot   Afterwards we were ready to leave Vegas immediately    Much to my surprise  the staff at the Emerald Suites  made the airline and LUXOR nightmare bearable  Since the airline couldn t get me out for two days  management upgraded me to a suite which was very nice and comfortable  The staff was extremely accommodating and it showed in the tips left for them  I would have expected to receive this type of treatment from the LUXOR  not a small hotel like the Emerald Suites  I felt it necessary to not only show my appreciation to them  but also to express my satisfaction to the general manager  They definitely have my vote for exceptional customer service    
N =>   very comfortable We stay at Emerald Suites when visiting our son in Las Vegas We find the location and room setup meets our needs perfectly Easy access to freeway and surface streets makes travel to all attractions very easy  
N =>  Value  Value    Value    Wonderful sweet suite hotel with excellent staff  facilities and location  It was great not to fight the crowds at the major hotels   especially when we received even better quality accomodations  The pool was great as were the rooms  They were spacious and clean  It was really nice to have kitchen facilities available to keep a cold drink and snackies in the fridge as well as inroom coffee to wake us up  Security was visible but not intrusive and we appreciated the courtesy and helpfulness of the whole staff  We would stay there again in a heartbeat    
N =>   So So Stay at the Emerald Suites Date  t       The hotel was not quite what we were expecting  but it was okay for the price  However  the lighting in the rooms could be better and it would be helpful if the lamps were plugged into wall sockets that are activated by the light switches The air conditioning unit made a thumping noise in the plumbing whenever we tried to cool the room down  It sounded like someone was playing bongo drums in the bathroom  The spa was warm  but the jets did not work so it was like sitting in a warm bath  The bath towels were well worn  which is not terrible  However  it would have been nice to have more than two bath towels since most women use more than one a day  one for wrapping their hair after showering   Also  there were no  pool  towels  so we had to ask the maids for extra towels or use the ones intended for the shower The main doors into the buildings could use devices to stop them slamming at all hours of the night  It was very disconcerting to hear the loud banging all night long The room had internet  but we had no idea how to use it  The front desk staff could not even tell us HOW to access the internet  so we had to find a wi fi spot every day to log on Oh   and on our last night  a guest ripped the fire extinguisher box completely off the wall and left it lying on the floor  When I reported it to the front desk upon check out  she seemed pretty unconcerned  It could just be that she was young  but I would have sent someone out right away to see if any other damage was done Paying for the full stay in advance was a little disconcerting  too  It makes it difficult to shorten the stay and find other lodging The location was good  If they can fix some of the issues above  we would consider staying there again  If those problems aren t rectified  we would probably choose to spend a little more to get a working spa and a little more quiet  
N =>    We love to stay here again  Great for family  I had booked two rooms in  quot Tropicana quot  for   days  Stay was very uncomfortable rooms being too far from main lobby and smoking   then we moved to emerald suites in Cameron    bed room suite  We      plus one infant family members had a very pleasant stay in emerald suites for   nights   We had nothing but regretting for staying in TropicanaWe loved everything in this suites  rooms appeared brand new or very recently renovated  We felt as if we are the first people to stay there  as they were so clean   Kitchen is too good  we made best use of it  Free internet  LAN   and local calls    above all the price we paid was very less  Many TV channels including travel channel  In brief  this was much better than the condo we now live in Cayman islands  At least we are paying double the money for last three years  It takes only   minutes to be in  quot STRIP quot         bus pass valid for    hours  with great connectivity and frequency    As our flight got delayed   we overstayed for   hours for free     And free airport coach    all these things were not included in our pricy Tropicana roomsI strongly recommend to stay here   NOT ON THE STRIP in a big crowd 
N =>  Gangster rap blasting at check in desk   Worst night staff in the history of all the hotels I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world  Cocaine was still on the kitchen counter in my room  Broken air  Key would not open my door the next morning  Worst hotel on the planet  No elevator etc        
N =>  Average Room was adequate and reasonably priced  My kids loved the pool  However this hotel is hardly on the strip  it is   miles from any of the main hotels  Don t count on a shuttle taking you to the strip either  The shuttle from this hotel runs every   hours  but it s first come first serve  The shuttle is a old    passenger van and none of the seatbelts worked  When the driver dropped us off at Mandalay Bay  he said just come back to this spot this is were we always drop off and pick up  My kids and I showed up there at      to be picked up and around      I gave the hotel a call and they connected me to the driver  The driver informed me that they had a airport run and would not be there for about another    minutes  She then asked me where I was  I told her I was at Mandalay Bay where the other driver dropped us off at  she then asked me to find out where that was and call her back  Needless to say I was not very happy  Also  they only issue you one key to the room  my husband left to go to the Nascar races and I stayed behind to go to the strip with the kids  The hotel informed us that we could leave the key at the front desk and whoever got back first could retrieve the key from them  I came back later that day to find that they had checked us out of our room by mistake which was prepaid for in full  I had to recheck in  The whole experience with this hotel was not a positive one  
N =>  Uncomfortable Experience We stayed at Emerald Suites Cameron location         there were   of us all together  We wanted a double room  The other hotel rates were quite expensive that week due to Nascar week  We chose this location because it was just across the street from the Orleans Casino where we absolutely love to eat and gamble  We figured we really wouldn t be spending too much time in the room just needed a  quot clean room quot  to sleep and shower  Upon checkin the lady at the front desk immediately gave us attitude I have no idea why  but the hotel manager heard the way she was speaking to us and took care of our checkin she was nice  When we walked into the room  it was stuffy and the sofa seemed to be very dirty and the linens were outdated  We just decided not to sit on the couch  My brother wanted to take a shower right away and found pubic hairs all over the towels  Gross   Called front desk   times and even attempted to go pick up towels ourself then the maintenance gentlleman dropped them off after an hour and a half time spand We cut our stay there shorter than originally booked for because   out of   of us developed a rash on our legs and after one long night we were sleeping late and the cleaning crew was banging rudely on the door  kicking us out at  am while the room was still paid for a few more days  Once that was situated we just didn t want to deal with it anymore  I would never stay there again  Either book the trip for a cheaper week or spend the extra money for a better hotel  We got less than what we payed for  Pictures of towels didnt come out good but I have other photos of the room  
N =>   Good Value for the price We booked a   bedroom suite during Vegas s busiest week  CES Show   The staff was a little busy but that was to be expected  The room is certainly not luxurious by any standard  but it was clean and functional  Not in the best neighborhood either  but close enough to where we needed to be  and for about     of what we would have paid to stay on the strip during this busy time  The are no elevators  but for our short stay that was not a big deal  Heating system was a little iffy  but overall a very good value  
N =>   Rude Staff Emerald Suite management should train their staff how to treat their customers appropriately  My recent experience ruined what would have been a good long week end stay in Las Vegas  Rooms run out of hot water  keys not working hours before your official check out time and no check out extension allowed even for an hour  The staff who managed my complaint was very rude and even threatened to call the police  She wouldn t even give her name even if their comment complain sheet requires that  She was rude enough to send her customer out just because they were dissatisfied with the service  We paid almost       for   rooms for   days     not cheap for hotel with very lousy service  The savings is not worth the ordeal me and my family went through Thank you for sending in your review  The community appreciates your feedback  
N => Emerald Suites Not So Sweet When we got to Vegas we went directly to an information desk to get help in transportation to the hotel The desk informed us that they had a limo and called the hotel to have the limo pick us up After an hour  we called again and the manager said the driver would be there in about five minutes After another hour  we called again  same story Finally  we saw a limo with the name written on the side so we ran to catch a ride and it was for another Emerald Suite  The driver said he would take us anyway We got no apologies from the management The hotel has no elevators  so we had to drag our luggage up two flights  Our windows looked out onto the side of another building  The carpet was an old brown shag that was worn and nasty looking The kitchen was clean It was located across the street from  quot The Orleans quot  which was pretty nice  but otherwise the location wasn t that great  
N =>   An average experience It was an okay hotel  The staff forgot to give me a wake up call  as I requested for Friday morning  My room  though clean  was on the third floor  That would be fine but  there were no elevators in the building  Thankfully  it was across from the Orleans hotel and casino  
N =>   WORST HOTEL EVER   In my    years of life  I ve never encountered such an establishment that was so non service in a service industry  Rooms were bare minimum  amp  their  quot Jewel of The Suite Life quot   should be removed from their site  Bugs in bed  security does every thing including housekeeping after  pm  Should be shut down by OSHA  
N =>  Absolutely Horrible  BAD BAD BAD Stayed at the one on Trop and Valley View and it has been a nightmare Train shakes building  screaming kids  prostitution  drug deals  internet NEVER works  and the phone didnt even have a cord   Room was dirty  and didnt even come with a remote to the TV They advertise free food  but you have to take a coupon to the Gold Spike downtown   NASTY BAD BAD BAD  
N =>   WORST EXPERIENCE EVER      i booked this hotel a week prior to arriving  it seemed like a good deal  me and my friend are celebrating our birthdays  we arrived late friday to see that the entire lower level is under remodeling  which was disturbing caused they mentioned nothing of this  we went out via the shuttle service  the shuttle driver conned us into beliving he was giving us free V I P  passes into Tangerine  We gave him a really good tip  come to find out there were promoters all over the strip and casino handing theese passes out for free    Saturday we were woke up at   am by pounding hammers from the remodeling below  we woke up rather early and got ready to spend the day downtown fremont street  the water went out in the morning so we couldnt take showers  they gave us no warning or apology  we came back from fremont street to discover fans scattered about in our room beacuse it had flooded after we left  we called the manager and went to speak with her  she accused us of leaving the water on intentionally and told us how we could be liable for thousands in repairs  that ruined our saturday night needless to say which turned out to be our birthdays  they moved us into seperate rooms which was the only proper thing they did all weekend  the room they moved us into showed signs of an electrical fire in one of the outlets  i have pic of all of this i will be uploading ASAPso far they charged me     on my credit card which is UNAUTHORIZED  as of now there being investigated by my bank for fraudulant charges  
N =>   Would come back here   Stayed here for   weeks  although off Strip it was just what we needed   cheaper  more space in the rooms  a little quieter but with proximity to Orleans Hotel   amp     hour shuttle to  amp  from the Tropicana  Very pleased with stay here  can t understand some of the negative reviews   we had no problems   rooms were very clean  cleaning staff were thorough  amp  very friendly   some Reception staff could be a little slow but tried to be helpful  Shuttle guys were great especially Anthony  amp  Dave  We would come back  amp  recommend it to other people  Only criticism  the couch in our room was a little battered   other than that we had a great stay 
N =>   Not worth the money you save  I stayed at the Emerald Suites for   nights and the service got worse every day  One day we did not get maid service at all  and if we did get maid service they never left enough towels and they did not vacuum  The hotel advertises free wireless Internet  which they do not have  The pool was dirty  dead bugs  hair  and a film on top of the water   The shuttle service to the Strip is nice but we usually has to wait at least a half an hour for the shuttle to arrive  when they told us it would only be a couple minutes   I would not stay here again  Pay a little more and stay on the Strip  it would be well worth it  
N =>   Good Value I would not hesitate to recommend this property  Clean  large rooms  Full size range and oven  full size refrigerator  This isn t a fancy strip hotel  but you are not paying      for a weekend night either  A couple of irritants   to use the internet in the lobby you must buy a card      for    minutes   outrageous   But they did print out boarding passes for free  They asked for driver s licenses for all adult occupants   give me a break   if I wanted to bring a hooker in  I sure wouldn t tell them at registration  
N =>   enjoyable stay Previous reviews have mentioned proximity to the railtrack  whilst agreeing that it does run very close to the back of this property  we never found the noise offensive and besides the trains were not that frequent  The suites were very pleasent  well equiped and cleaned daily by very efficient and friendly staff  on arrival we found little crockery  mentioned this to housekeeping an immediately received a full set   The pool and spa were also well kept and were very welcome after a hot day on the strip  Location to the strip was as stated    mile  a    minutes stroll or   minutes by bus  CAT      very good value   We had read that the area around the suites was frequented by undesirables  this we thought a little unfair  sure there were a few people who were down on their luck  but you will find that in any city in the world  we never felt intimidated nor were given reason to be  All in all we had a really great two weeks stay at Emerald Suites Tropicana  Thanks to the hard working staff  We have no hesitation in recommending this establishment John  amp  Sharon CalvertonNottinghamshireEngland 
N =>   NEVER did we get housekeeping      My Husband  amp  I booked a room for   nights at this hotel  Never once did we receive any type of Housekeeping  We had to take our trash out to the dumpster daily  Only   Towels and washclothes were in our room when we arrived  On the  rd day I asked for fresh towels from a maid outside our door  We washed the used towels in the laundry room that same morning  We asked for trash bags and was told they would bring them  When we returned later that afternoon they had put a fresh trash bag in  BUT OMG they took our   towels we had asked for    I was furious to say the least    Towels and washclothes for   days  And we paid to wash the ones we had when we arrived  EXCUSE ME    Hot Tub closed due to heat being out on it  Pool was ICE COLD  No Ice Machine on property working  On the  th day I went to the front desk and was told we should have gotten maid service at least   time during the stay  And they wanted to come clean the room then  EXCUSEEEEE Me after   days thats all you offer us  NEVER  NEVER stay at this hotel     There is NO EXCUSE Whatsoever they should have treated us like they did  
N =>   Beware No Elevator  American West put up at this ROACH INFESTED DUMP after a missed connection  we hated it  No bellboy  no luggage cart  and if you can believe    NO ELEVATOR  We had to drag   bags up   flights of stairs  The suite had   queen bed and no sleeper sofa  We had to dodge roaches on our way to our room  
N =>  Worst hotel in Las Vegas This hotel is the absolute worst place to stay in Las Vegas  There was BLOOD on EVERY pillow  blood on the sheets in BOTH BEDS  Used Q Tips under the bed  the fridge ran all night  the toilet ran and leaked  the train went by the room every HOUR  The beds were not FULL SIZE  they were two twin beds pushed together and extremly uncomfortable  The blinds were missing and crooked  people could see in our room as they walked by  Electric sockets did not work  the hotel staff informed us that soap and dishwashing soap was not a  quot GIft quot  and they instructed us to go buy our own and leave the rest for the next guests  The couch has springs sticking through it  THE HOTEL STAFF WERE EXTREMLY RUDE     At first they blamed this on us        They moved us to another room at   pm and got mad at us for going back one last time to check for everything  The manager offered us     off per night making the room     before taxes  the person behind us in line was offered     a night incuding taxes  I wouldnt stay at this hotel again if it was free  PLEASE SEE PICTURES                                
N =>  Most Definately The Worst Place Ever  I had read all the previous reviews prior to booking our room and thought that maybe some of the reviews were just a little exaggerated    I was so wrong  Let me get to the point     at about  a m   yes one o clock in the morning  our second night  another guest had a key to our room  Good thing my husband was still awake watching t v   the guy appologized and when my husband looked out the window  he sees   luggages there  So my husband calls the front desk and speaks to one of the rude front desk workers and the guy says  quot we have no record of you being registered in that room  you need to come down to the front desk and show us your reciept  quot  My husband woke me up and told me what happened so of course that just infuriates me and I call the front desk up and I said a few choice words to him and when I went down to the office I showed they guy two pieces of paper  the only papers ever given to us when we checked in and the confirmation paper I got online showing that the room was prepaid  and he said he needed MORE PROOF that we were suppose to be there  by this time another guy comes out and says  quot Your not suppose to even be in that room    you are in the wrong room  you were suppose to be in      quot  he says it in a tone that I was an idiot for going in to the wrong room  so i said if that s so  how was it that the KEY was able to open      if it was the wrong room  The guy tried to appologize and that s when the first guy inturrupted and told him  quot No quot  and looks at me and says  quot you can speak to the manager about this in the morning quot  like I was the one in trouble  Apparently this type of incident has happened a couple of times before and the Manager even admits it  We had booked the room for   adults and   children  When we had first walked into the room  I thought     quot you ve got to be kidding me quot   It just didn t  quot feel quot  clean  The toilet looked old and the bathroom counter top looked like it had caked on dust in the corner  The kitchenette was a big joke  One of the burners  front left  did not work  It was not  quot stocked quot  like advertised  It had ONE dinner plate  two salad plates and two small bowls  three juice cups and two cups that were a bit larger but you can t tell unless you put them next to each other  A coffee maker with a packet of coffee  BUT no cream  sugar or coffee cups    doesn t make any sense  Three forks and three teaspons  One    inch pan and a   quart pot  Empty salt and pepper shackers  Please don t ever stay at the hotel  Other I did not like about this hotel  no elevator  the air conditioner was about at loud as the train  we had asked for more towels  there was only one bath towel  two hand towels and one washcloth  and the security guard brought it up to us and said  quot here  this is all you can have because we are limited on supplies quot If you need to find a place suite to stay at that has a well stocked kitchenette  friendly staff and clean rooms  stay at the Fairfield Grand Desert  It is well worth your money  we paid      night Fri Sun   br  ba suite  and the only reason we didn t stay there was because they were all booked up for the days we needed  
N =>  Dont ever stay at this hotel     This hotel was the worst hotel ever  I felt dirty the moment I walked into the lobby  It was even worse when I got into the room  I didn t even want to sleep in the bed because it felt so gross  To top it off they gave another guest our room key  and in the middle of the night we had someone walk into our rm while we were sleeping  I am only glad that we only had it reserved for one night  
N =>   Rude and Uncompromising Their website is deceptive and all but makes invisible a scroll down bar which tells you at the very bottom of a long scroll  that reservations must be cancelled    hours in advance which is far from the industry norm  It also does not illustrate this point on the email confirmation they send you  I tried to cancel inside the    hr  window  and was told no way  they were charging my card  I could understand if this was the Bellagio  but a small corporation like this should do everything in it s power to generate good will and a happy customer base  
N => Worst hotel ever rude staff  
N =>  Not that bad   LOL    
N =>  Pretty Good  
N =>  Not that Bad    
N => Beautiful accommodation   just a long way to go to explore I had read mixed reviews about Encore before deciding to stay there  I had wanted somewhere that was beyond words   modern  with spectacular views  central location  ie not too much walking   amp  was prepared to spend just that little bit more to get it  I was only partially happy with my chosen location The staff on check in were friendly  We did agreed to go with a room  quot upgrade quot   amp  were not disappointed with the views or our room  The rooms were large  amp  luxurious    amp  the most comfy beds   The only real downside was the location  The hotel was a long way from anywhere  amp  was not a central strip location  they were rebuilding the outside of the hotel when we were travelling  amp  was noisy through the night  as we were up high it was fairly faint  amp  didnt disturb us too much  However  it made going into  amp  out of the hotel a bit of a mission  House keeping didnt replenish the supplies of showergel etc once used  
N => Niiiice From the moment I arrived to the moment I left  it was great  Atmosphere   check  friendly service   check  nice casino   check  Was here with a group of   and the sole reason was to indulge in a little too much alcohol  gambling and of course entertainment  The rooms were WOW  spacious suite  beds uber comfortable  great views  bathrooms were also large  even though I only spent a few hours here over the   days  it was a welcoming thought to be going back to the room  Bargain price for what you get plus a     resort credit  All the staff were great  in particular Rula in the lobby lounge  she endured our drunken babbles but was always courteous and she knew when we were running low  even though she was busy  The security staff here is also great  Definately come back 
N => Very Disappointed After staying at the Wynn last year I was very excited at the prospect of staying at Enocore  after reading all the hype on web site  We got to our  suite  which was nothing special and felt slightly crampt compared to the Wynn standard resort room we had last year  In Wynn we received a nightly turndown service which was a nice touch but this was by request only here  also there was construction work  replacing the entrance to the casino  which I have to say ruined the stay  the work was    hours a day drilling and banging   im not been over dramatic here either  we would of appreciated been contacted prior to our arrival to have had the option of moving hotels This been said the room was well appointed  nice toiletries and a large comfy bed  We ate in the hotel which we found quite reasonable for the extremely good quality food and ambiance  also helped by a big win on the BJ tables straight after to more than cover the costs   I wouldn t return here again and would advise anyone looking at making a booking at the resort to stay at Wynn 
N =>   Pass on this Hotel We had   nights and   days at Encore Hotel but it won t be a hotel we stay at again  Upon checking in the computer crashes  we have to wait for almost    minutes to get a key that wasn t a universal key only to go to the room and find the room to be extremely hot  Put AC on at    and found it wasn t helping  big note on this hotel is there is no A C vents in the bathroom too  Who wants to shower in a hot bathroom then attempt to dry your hair  Got a fan didn t help  Was told there were no other rooms to move to  Had to call the repair man for the wine bar as the brain element was exposed  guess no one checks these things when they refill the bar  its pretty obvious  duh  We finally went back to the registration to get the universal key only to listen to the guest next to us get offered a upgraded room on a higher floor   gee thought that wasn t available   Of course I had to complain then to the night manager who got us moved to a higher floor at what   pm at night   at least once you got off the elevator you can tell the floor was much cooler so the new room had AC that actually worked  Still no cooling in the bathroom but it was better  The spa staff on Saturday and Sunday were extremely rude   Once you checked in and got a locker you got hassled at the gym because you were suppose to get a pass to use the facility but the rude employees at the spa said you didn t need one  Now ask yourself if the staff at the gym said we needed it why would the spa staff say we didn t   The spa its self was fine but the prep area to get dressed and put makeup and dry your hair was terrible  poor lighting and not enough cleaned brushes to use  In fact you didn t know what was clean   I advise bring your own hair brush  The pool area in spots had a definite smell of the sewer and wasn t pleasant   Finding a waitress was a difficult by the pool too   They had plenty of guests around the pool area that they could have had more staff to accomodate   I saw guests ask for things and then were never brought them too   Restaurants were good with the exception of Switch  staff didn t seem to know to change glasses when they are pouring a different bottle of wine  and with a corkage of     a bottle that should not happen   We weren t impressed with the food at Switch either   There are so many hotels on the strip that you should try first before you stay at this hotel   I did send in all my comments to the hotel via email and all I got back was sorry   We will spend our money elsewhere next time   
N =>   ALL guests should be treated equally  Upon returning to the hotel after a great comedy show  our taxi  as well as the twenty      or so surrounding us  were unable to enter the otherwise regular entrance exit thoroughfare due to Wynn employees placing pilons  amp  guarding same  in such driveway  All exiting taxi patrons were forced to be dropped off in the middle of an otherwise busy traffic lane  Then  our party of four     was admonished by  quot Steve quot  in security for attempting to utilize a  quot private entrance quot   although we had used same repeatedly prior thereto  for over twenty four      hrs  w  the blessings of other Wynn employees 
N =>   Beautiful hotel wonderful stay but housekeeping could be better We arrived on Sunday lunchtime for our   night stay and waited about    minutes to check in  Once we were sorted  the check in clerk called the bell desk for us to have our bags delivered to the room  We waited no more than    minutes for them to arrive and the bell hop was very pleasant  helpful and grateful for the tip we gave him  We got the room for a fantastic rate of      per night The room itself was lovely with a view of the north Strip  Circus Circus  Stratosphere  Riviera  to the left and the Wynn golf course and the convention centre to the right The drapes and lights were all centrally controlled from a little pad beside the bed which my husband enjoyed tinkering with  The safe inside the wardrobe was easy to set and free to use but it was a little bit small so there was no room for my husband to keep his binoculars  It was fine for storing the passports and tickets though The communal areas were all immaculately kept and the red theme was beautiful throughout  The casino wasn t busy and there was never any problem getting on my favourite slot machine  Cocktail service was pretty good in the casino and the waitresses outfits are the most beautiful in Vegas  black and backless with tiny crystals  Although we didn t spend any time by the pool this trip we did check out the pool area and it was absolutely gorgeous  We had to show our room key to gain access and were immediately offered towels which we declined  We strolled around the pool and it was very peaceful  The gardens were immaculate If I was to find fault with the hotel room I would say that housekeeping let it down The black couch was quite dusty and it had a dubious white stain  There was a sticky cup stain on the desk which stayed there for the duration of our stay  The glasses that we used in the room were only washed up once in three days  When housekeeping came to do the room they just made the bed and folded replaced the towels  The amenities that we used were not replaced and they didn t tidy or spruce up the room  although they never forgot to put the card advertising the Encore shops  restaurants and spa services on the bed   Although it was a little bit disappointing for a   star hotel it certainly wasn t bad enough to make me complain to the front desk or spoil my Encore experience in any way  Had I been staying for longer than   nights then I may have placed a call to housekeeping but it just didn t seem worth it for the short period of time we were staying  
N =>   Awesome Place to Stay Checked into the Encore because I prefer to stay at newer hotels because of my allergies  Was picked up at airport by one of the Wynn Rolls Royces  the driver was super friendly and then driven to the tower suites private entrance  Check in was very quick and easy  and the suite was amazing  Spacious  had that new smell  bed was super comfortable and the suite even had a private massage table room  Food and room service was fantastic and my casino host made sure anything I needed   happened  
N =>   Mind less Staff How about for starters I was getting married in Vegas and was suppose to be upgraded to a larger suite with a centurion upgrade The Mgr told me to wait a day because they were booked and then they will have something available I did I waited until  PM the next day unchecked in my current room only to be upgraded to a handicap room on a much lower floor  no view  that they assured me was a beautiful parlor suite It looked like a room from my worst nightmare at         I declined the room and checked into original suite The suite could not accomodate both my clothes and my soon to be wife s clothes for   days To make up for us wasting a day they sent chocolate which I sent back Give me a break I expected them to take off the   day room stay that we did not use and they then offered me a        bottle of champagne Told them where to put it I called before my arrival to see if they had a computer center to go online for my business They assured me they did but when I arrived they told me it was closed They had no computers anywhere to use except a Kiosk in the Wynn hotel When my wife was waiting for me at the kiosk computer  security came over to my wife and told her not to stand where she was in case someone wanted to use the phone I told him what he needed to hear as well DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL  PS try        for a pot of coffee  room Service When I get      I like to enjoy it  
N =>  Poor attempt to be a   star We arrived at the Wynn Encore already dazzled by the Las Vegas Strip in full flow We were then greeted by an amazing foyer and fantastic staff on our check in the problems started when we went to find a bite to eat How disappointed i became when faced with a bill for     for   cheeseburgers   coke  amp  a beer for the wife Vegas i agree but it is cheaper in Dubai     our fun did not end there we went on to pay     for a beer and a Malibu  amp  coke its obviously not imported as its only about    for both in Florida By the by  not to be put off we carried on our Vegas experience by not eating in the Encore again it was only when we came to check out at   pm five days later we were forced to feel the totally unacceptable customer service of a so called   star hotel we were getting a transfer to the airport at      pm and were offered to chance to get changed into our traveling clothes in the lavatories or pay     each to use the pool   no transfer rooms or late checkout available and not   of the reception staff gave a monkeys a far cry from when we checked in   All in all a basic rule is if you want as   star hotel do not stay in the Encore as you will be very disappointed There are many hotels on the strip that do not claim to be   star that offer and give a more personable service weather you are a residence high roller or not as we found out  
N =>  Encore should be renamed The Rudest Place to Stay in Las Vegas I had expected a beautiful room with great service from a   star hotel but I was sorely disappointed  I should have known something was up when I called to confirm my reservation the day before our arrival and was told   quot Oh  you re a  marketing  reservation quot   Um  yes  I m an invited guest   little did I know that meant I was on trial by this hotel  While the room was very nice and I was always addressed by name  I kept getting the uneasy feeling I was being watched  judged by everything I did  didn t do   even by my choice of breakfast  The everyday staff was very friendly   valet  bellman  housekeeper  It is true about the glaring omission of a fan in the water closet or even in the large bathroom itself  Beautiful TV but  gosh  no HBO or Showtime  Even Motel   has HBO  Bad enough I had to pay         day for a tiny fridge   I didn t dare try the internet service of         day  which is free in every other hotel I ve stayed When the time came to check out I needed an extra hour  something I have asked for on a few occasions and always been granted  the Venetian  my favorite hotel  offered   hours    The female voice at the front desk asked me to wait on the phone  so after    minutes she returned to the line   sorry   quot marketing quot  said no  I couldn t have the extra hour and sternly asked   quot You will leave on time  correct  quot  I knew what had happened  I didn t play and lose enough money in their casino  being tracked and graded by my casino card  I m not rich  good enough for their hotel  I purposely checked out at the front desk instead of by phone so as to tell them that I vacated the room    minutes late because the bellman was late  The girl behind the counter seemed nice enough until I mentioned I had wanted an extra hour   she replied   quot Well  you should have paid a higher rate quot   Hmm  rude enough to say and especially ridiculous  considering I didn t choose my rate  MARKETING chose it I did call the hotel when I returned home  spoke with a very nice woman in keting and a gracious hotel manager  however  my partner and I felt so insulted with this hotel experience we won t be staying or gambling at Encore or Wynn again  I m sure the next time we go back to Las Vegas  we go     times a year  our stay at The Venetian will be wonderful as usual  
N =>   Absolutely Beautiful We just got back from our trip to Las Vegas  amp  staying at the Encore was definitely a high light of the trip  The hotel is first class all the way  The staff is very friendly  very helpful  amp  goes above  amp  beyond to make your trip perfect  We were offered to upgrade out suite for     night  amp  very glad we did  We got the panoramic suite  which gives a better view  We were actually facing downtown  amp  didn t get to see too many hotels but the view was still wonderful The room is amazing  there s a control next to the bed to close open the curtain  turn the lights on off in the room  amp  even to turn a privacy request so the maids won t bother you  No sign on the door at the Encore  the control activates a  privacy quot  light next to the door  The bathroom is equally as luxurious  There s a tub    separate sinks  amp  a see through shower  Everything is high end  You might get soaps  amp  towels at all hotels but none of them will match what the Encore offers The only downside to the room  amp  was very surprising to me  amp  my husband was the fact that you could hear the people talking in the next room  As well as every time they came in at   or   in the morning we could hear their radio  Very surprised with the Encore quality that the walls would be so thin  
N =>   Enjoyed the Encore We enjoyed our trip to the Encore In e  The rate was right       per night  the room was very spacious and clean  As other posters have mentioned you have to ask for turndown service  The restaurant deals were great  We loved the Taste of Wynn menus that were available  The pool looked nice but it was so hot that we opted not to lay out by the pool  The spa was beautiful and the workout area was more than adequate but we opted not to partake  We felt it was not a wise use of our funds as there is no co ed area to enjoy after a workout  The walking on the strip more than made up for no workout  On area where we had complaints was in the lobby bar  The service was spotty and slow and our cocktail waitress made numerous mistakes with our orders  Drink service on the floor was OK one night and slow the next night  
N =>   Exceeded Expectations My wife and I stayed at the Encore ober  th through the  th  and I must say that it exceeded our expectations  We had stayed at the Wynn on our last trip  so we pretty much knew what to expect  I had read all of the reviews  so I was expecting a lot of negative things mixed in with the gorgeous surroundings  But it never occurred  The       coffee we read about was not correct  it was        The terrible noise from the club was nonexistent  and two of our nights there were club nights  and we stayed on the dreaded side of the hotel we were warned not to stay on    th floor   I am sure that some travelers have had bad experiences  but ours was fantastic  and we would definitely stay again  We knew where it was located on the strip  but that was not a problem as we always rent a car so that we can travel to other parts of Las Vegas while there  I highly recommend the Encore  
N =>   stunning hotel  top draw A   star property      and value for moneycoming from south africa   you are not going to las Vegas every six months  so we went for the best  amazing service from check in to check out  we stayed   nightsspotless rooms  we had a room on   th floor with a stunning view over the stripshop online at the offical website fro best prices and book in advance 
N =>   Encore Exceeds Expectations  My wife and I travel to Vegas with two other couples in late tember  We had decided to book at Encore several months earlier and we could not have made a better choice    Star from top to bottom and from what I could tell  the nicest overall hotel in Vegas now  Food  drink  casino  pools were all fantastic  I bit of a walk if you like to walk the Strip  but well worth the money and we will be back for sure  
N =>   Fabulous    Hotel little far from the strip action but that s part of the class  Stayed at Encore for   nights    have stayed at Wynn and thought we would try out the new sister property After an ultra early arrival we hoped to check in early in the morning  This was not happening  though we did agree to an upgraded room for nominal charge that was vacant and would be available earlier than  pm  Still wondering if we were suckered on that but room was ready at noon and staff called our cell phone to advise us Room   fantastic  bathroom   fantastic  view   fantastic  We heard virtually no neighbouring guests aside from the occasional toilet flushing  King sized bed was heavenly  Towels and toiletries all awesome Encore has all the bells  amp  whistles  However it is not cheap so one should not expect such  Little disappointed that we paid for such lavish accomodations but so much was also additional    business centre was not free for guests  mini bar ammenities were extremely expensive  in room safe was additional charge  But we are by no means complaining Location is a bit far and it takes a bit of a hike to even get out to the strip via Wynn  Casino though was quiet likely due to this and had excellent drink service while on casino floor Dining options are plentiful and excellent  including many restaurants over at Wynn  A great trip    will stay again at a Wynn property  
N =>   Encore a good choice for first trip to Las Vegas I recently returned from my first trip to Las Vegas  where I stayed at the Encore at Wynn  The hotel is absolutely beautiful  with a whimsical butterfly motif set on red backdrop  The staff was absolutely wonderful  from the dealers to the floor people to the waitresses  They all remembered who we were and what we were drinking  The rooms were large and lavish  with a gigantic tub and separate shower  I enjoyed soaking in the bath while watching the flat screen tv in the bathroom  My one complaint was the loss of water we encountered for about a   hour period  Upon returning to the hotel one evening  we discovered the water was not working  We were not alerted by the staff  but discovered the problem ourselves when we tried to turn on the faucet  There was no water until   the next morning  We were given no compensation for this severe inconvenience  Otherwise  we had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this hotel  
N =>  Beautiful Rooms We went to LV for a   th birthday party  Stayed   nights  which I thought would be plenty until we got there  Hadn t been to LV in    years  amp  didn t know how really luxurious the Encore would be   I would have happily stayed several more days  The rooms are huge and beautifully done  We had a king resort suite  Bathrooms were great   even a small flat screen in there  The lobbies and gambling areas are gorgeous  Wish we would have had more time just to wander around  
N =>  Beautiful hotel with amazing rooms  My husband and I stayed here for my   th Birthday celebration  We were impressed by the hotel s decor  ambiance and cleanliness throughout  We did like many others have trouble getting our room  which wasn t ready until after   p m   but the manager was very nice and gave us a room with an amazing view to make up for it  Our room was also not clean  but they did take care of this as well by sending in a detailing crew  We were happy after that was taken care of and loved staying at this hotel  which seemed to be out of the hustle and bustle of the strip  We would return  
N =>  Go with your gut  I was looking for a great place to stay during my   th birthday trip with my girlfriends  I have heard varying reviews from people on TA stating it was not a hotel for younger people  the ambiance of the hotel was very stuffy  sometimes you can hear the music from the nightclub etc  I am HAPPY I stayed there because the ENCORE was a FABULOUS place to stay  Two girls from my group SCREAMED loudly upon entering their rooms  We had a room on the   th floor with a view of the strip and the pools  We heard no noise from the parties etc  The staff was nice  the rooms were exceptionally clean  the pools were clean unlike the ones at MGM that were murky  greasy  amp  salty  eww    The Wynn buffet was a delight to look forward to in the morning  I look forward to going back to Vegas early next year  amp  staying here with my S O  
N =>  Totally wheelchair friendly      I have to say to spite some of the reviews  that this hotel is everything we expected and more  Our stay was for   nights   days  My first fear was how accessible it would be for my partner who is disabled  There were no problems in any area  including getting INTO and OUT OF the actual pools  not just poolside  They arranged to have an electric lift at poolside when ever he wanted to enter the water  What a delight  for him to swim and not have to think about it  The staff is incredibly nice and will go the extra mile for those with special needs The Handicapped room was more than we expected  Someone really thought about the needs of the disabled when designing these rooms  The bathroom had hand rails in just the right places  a fold down shower seat  with hand held shower head again good rail positioning and wheelchair space  The room had more than needed open space for scooter turn a rounds  and extra sockets for plug ins that some of our equipment requires bedside  I can t tell you how tired I am of having to move lamps  clocks etc   in most other hotels just to accommodate a simple bipap or to recharge the scooter  It was so nice to finally have a vacation that I didn t have to plan out every move because of inaccessibility  This hotel did their thinking for us  GREAT PLACE  GREAT FOOD  and GREAT VIEWS I can only say to those who have trouble getting around with a scooter or wheelchair  this hotel goes far and beyond to accommodate the handicapped  
N =>  What can one say Everything was too much   from the strip view to electronic drapes console controlled lights  The bed made you sleep it was so comfortable  Reception could not do enough to help  As I say you have to stay there if in vegas  
N =>  Best Vegas trip ever thanks to Steve  We spent   days    nights on the   nd floor  although    thru    are missing  Asian superstition maybe   I ve been going to Vegas for    years and thought it was just another mini vacation  Not so  We responded to a mailer offering a good package  including   tickets to Le Reve      gambling money and     hotel money plus a  rd night free  Other than the     per night view upgrade  everything was exactly as advertised  Valet and Check in were a breeze  the room had an unbelievable view and was spacious  It had a large sitting area  pivoting flat screen and a tv in the bathroom to go with the soaking tub  Complaints  No coffee in the room  internet is      day and do not touch the  honor bar  stuff   
N =>  W O W This hotel is by far the nicest hotel I have ever visited    i was in awe upon arrival at the hotel lobby which was very plush with red butterflies every where the check in experiance was quick and easy and the room was huge and absolutely gorgeous  Can not fault this hotel in anyway i would definately reccomend this to anyone visiting vegas but be warned its not cheap most tables are    dollar minimum and that doesnt last    seconds  but on the plus side there are plenty of   cent machines which kept me happy  Would also recommend the sw steakhouse a bit pricey but worth every penny   overall a fantastic experiance  
N =>   WONDERFUL from start to finish    We had a wonderful experience here from start to finish  We went on a promotion we received in the mail two days before we left home  great timing   We got everything on the promotion without any problems  La Rev tkts  dining credit  slot credit  and set room charge   They didn t try to upsell us at all  In fact we had to ask to pay more to get a room on a higher floor on the strip side  Our room was gorgeous and housekeeping was flawless  We ate at several restaurants in the hotel and they were all good  Zoozacrackers  Sugar  amp  Ice Terrace Point Cafe  Parasol Down  and Daniel Bouloud   Special kudos to Daniel Bouloud   We loved the pool especially the European one  Great vibe and good music  We could always find a chair and poolside service was topnotch  Drinks were pricey at the pool but where is that not the norm now   The casino was very nice too  not smoky at all  my one pet peeve about Vegas   I hate the smoke   Didn t care for the plastic red chandeliers but everything else was beautiful and well done  We could always find a Blackjack table when we wanted one  It was our  nd time to La Reve and it was better than the first time   I can not figure out why that show is not packed like the others  It is just as good if not better then the Cirque shows there We loved the Wynn also although we didn t spend much time there  and never went to that pool  we were happy with Encore We went to Mirage for LOVE  AWESOME SHOW   and the crowds were incredible  I can t imagine staying there  Encore was spacious and not crowded  I shouldn t write this review as I would like it to stay an undiscovered gem but I m sure it won t stay that way  You can go to the crowds when you want them but you don t have to stay there  Stay at Encore where you can walk without touching the person next to you  unless you want to of course  We would definitely return promotion or no promotion  Bellagio was our  home away from home  in Vegas but Encore has now taken its place  
N =>   How can this be rated   th     No   all day long     First time to Vegas  loved it     But I never expected the Hotel to be my lasting memory I have stopped in    many times before but nothing comes close to the sheer opulance and quality of the hotel  The reception area has no theme but looks stunning in striking reds  purples and a butterfly theme running everywhere  Rooms are exceptional in size  decor and cleanliness  How sad am I  to try and find fault in the hotel of      rooms I thought I would see how long I had to wait for the lift  One morning it got to    seconds and I felt like putting a complaint in at reception     Pool area is beautifully designed although   pool looses then sun in the afternoons  Sunbed loungers are so comfy  once you in  your staying    Yes  its not cheap to eat or drink there  but no more expensive than any other luxury hotel  You cannot expect a hotel of this class to serve a       burger  but at        I don t thinks its silly money It s a little bit away from the main strip but I think that helps to give a more elegant feel at times  Didn t do much gambling so can t comment on that Overall  stunning and how is this rated   th Madness     
N =>   Out of this world    Second time in Vegas  stayed in Caesars Palace last time and was tempted to go there again but decided on Encore last year when booking as we really liked the look of Wynn first time round  as often quoted by reviewers was a bit concerened by wide variations of vistors experiences   Needn t have worried  It was our   th wedding anniversary we got an upgrade  free   to panoramic room and some resort credits  Check in was fast and smooth  we arrived mid afternoon on a weds so did not expect a problem  room was ready  straight in   fantastic  beautiful suite  we chose a higher floor  we were offered a lower one strip facing but was wary of noise from XS  no disturbances  occasional noise from other rooms but nothing of note  The casino area is smaller and quieter than most in Vegas and as a result even on the labour day weekend was not too hectic  Pool area was fab we allways got a seat  Restaurants were really nice  staff were attentive and friendly  In short we loved the place and although we only stayed   days out of a    day vist to Vegas we really would have loved to have stayed all    days and are already planning to go back  Spa was unbelievable PS While in Vegas we spent   night in the Pallazo which was also superb  try spending a week in Vegas    days in Encore   in Pallazo you ll love it  Proper   star hotels  
N =>   Loved It   We had booked this trip to get married and our family were coming and had never been to Vegas before  we had been   years ago and stayed at Mandalay Bay  so we wanted to impress  I always make the mistake of reading the reviews after we have booked All I can say is that everything was great  I am not going to go on like some people have  From the minute we arrived in the hotel we enjoyed it all  We were checked in quickly   we were even given a free room upgrade as we were getting married in the hotel  The staff were friendly  the room lovely  the view was amazing   location fantastic   really close to everything you needed  Our    week old son came with us  we had asked for a crib in the room which was provided as were baby toiletries which I thought was a lovely touch  We ate at The Terrace Pointe Cafe   the service was very slow here  We also ate at The Buffet   I have never seen anything like it  MASSIVE  We ate at Botero s too  which was lovely  Our wedding went without any hitches  Laquiter and Emily were wonderful in organising everything for us  the Reverand made the cermeony feel very personal and the photographer took some stunning photos We were thrilled that everything was as we would have expected it to be and we would definately not hesitate in returning to the Encore  
N =>   Fabulous luxury hotel just wish it was closer to everything else on the strip My girlfriends and I booked a girls trip to Las Vegas in tember with a side tour trip to the Grand Canyon  We stayed for   nights in the Encore in two Resort Suites  two girls per room   Upon arrival  at    noon   we were told check in was at   pm but they would call us when the rooms were available  i e  cleaned   By  pm  we were in our room and it was fantastic  The bed was SO comfortable and because it was just two girls in a king sized bed  we never felt the other was in the same bed  The room was large with a separate living area  a great big bathroom and fun controls for the lighting and drapes  The downsides of the room included very little dresser space for our clothes and etc as well as being charged for using the fridge in the minibar  I e   we couldn t keep our bottle of water cold because there was sensor in the fridge detecting if we put anything in there  Also  the snacks that are laid out so prominently on the cupboard were sensored that if you moved anything for more then    seconds  it was charged to your room  So  if I accidently knocked over the box of caramel corn cookies  I d be charged     for it We went Labour Day weekend  along with everyone else in North America and it was packed  The pool was packed  The casino was packed  The restaurants were packed  We couldn t even have the concierge help us out with going to the nightclub  XS  because all lists were blacked out  Fortunately  we were a group of pretty girls and had no issues gettting in afterall even though there was a massive line up to get into the club The location of the hotel was not so great  Being on the north end of the strip  we were close to the fashion show mall but not much else  We had to cab everywhere since it was too hot to be outside walking for too long Overall  great hotel  The casino needed some improvements since the layout was abit sporadic with tables and slots mixed in areas  Pool was FANTASTIC if you could get a seat  go early to get one on a long weekend   I would definetely stay here again but probably not on a long weekend  
N =>   Wynn Encore did not deliver Recently Steve Wynn made a commitment to his employees that was pretty unique these days  My observation  during my recent stay  was that he should have gotten an equal commitment from his employees  We arrived to the hotel in a rush to check in as our flight had been delayed and we had reservations to get to within the hour  We were greeted and after a few moments were looked after   good first impression  We agreed to pay for an upgrade for a better view  Then it started to go sideways  Got up to our room hoping to do a quick freshen up only to find the room wasn t cleaned  Called down to the desk they said they would switch us and would be up with a key  We waited and finally thought we have to go and deal with this later   opened the door and there he was in the hall   saying  gee I wondered where you guys were    maybe knocking might have worked  Better yet   knowing we were in a hurry   the offer to move out bags for us was met with  oh that would be the bell desk    not the answer you would hope for  Over all the stay was uninspiring from a service perspective  From the restaurants to the casino  most seemed to be less than enthused to be there  Rooms were okay but no more than one would expect in this category  Probably the  weirdest  thing was ordering lunch by the pool and it arriving in a plastic bag  Just did not meet my expectations for a five star resort as compared to our previous stay at the Palazzo  
N =>  Great hotel  A luxurious experience We loved our stay at Encore and will stay there again  Check in was easy  we upgraded to a high floor suite  which was well worth it  Room was elegant and sexy  just perfect  Rooms were pretty quiet  but I m glad we had a high floor with the music at XS down below  If on low floor  ask for north strip view to be on other side of music  Spa was best ever  totally worth it  We had a    min massage  too short   but spent    hrs overall  Saunas  steam room  pools  showers  etc were great  Very relaxing and spa attendants were very attentive and professional Pool gets crowded  but not overly so   just enough to make it fun  Get there early for a lounge chair  While several bathers were topless  it was all very respectable  Not an MTV crowd  Good pool service  We lost the sun for     hrs when it goes behind the Wynn  but otherwise plenty of direct sun Sinatra was excellent  Pre fix meal for     was a good value  No cannolis offered though for dessert  which I found odd  We didnt do any of the night clubs  but I heard they are very expensive and Encore guest really dont have much priority over others We saw a comedian at the improv at Harrah s  which was hilarious  Zumanity was interesting for    minutes  but then got old  Not worth it Potential Cons    north strip location requires longer walks and or cabs to middle strip  I like this though as it keeps the casino floor and shops less crowded with non hotel guest   while the restaurants and hotel rooms are worth the price  the little stuff is too expensive  Drinks  suntain lotion  etc are annoyingly expensive  Wine also tends to be  x retail in restaurants  which is irksome   we are not gamblers  so I cant comment on casino other than that it looked nice  probably not the best kid hotel  We ve stayed at others with our kids that seemed much more kid friendly   this is specifically why we choose Encore though    
N =>  Great time  Had a great time staying at Encore  Check in was a breeze  Service was great  Room and view was unreal  
N =>  Beautiful  My husband and I stayed at Encore ust   th through tember  st  We checked in on Saturday at noonish with maybe a   minute wait  We had a      per night rate  They wanted to put us the  th floor but offered for     more a night she could upgrade us to a panoramic room  We went ahead and said OK  We ended up with a north view of downtown  Riviera  Circus Circus  etc  on the   st floor    definitely not worth the extra     per night  I now think the  th floor would have been just fine  We also had a     resort credit to use during out stay  In Encore Wynn we ate at the Terrace Pointe Cafe  Sugar and Spice  The Drugstore  and we were comped two buffets on our last day  My husband went to the spa for a massage one morning  We bought coffee  drinks  soda  etc  during our stay  What I am trying to say is  we did spend money inside the property but upon checkout we could not figure out where they applied the     resort credit  When I asked about it after receiving our final bill  she assured me it had been taken off  I asked to see where and she acted annoyed   but printed out a short receipt showing me where it had been applied but told me I could not have a copy of it  The credit had actually been applied to the room rate  Very strange  Anyway  we really liked our room  It was very beautiful  We didn t have slippers or turn down service either but everything else about it was so nice  We wore our robes while in the room  We even saw an older man with his bathrobe on in the hotel bar coffee shop right when you get off the elevators The casino area was very nice too  quiet but nice  We didn t do well with our slot play in Encore or Wynn or any where  It was not a profitable trip but we certainly enjoyed the stay  We saw LOVE at the Mirage Sunday night and I have to say it is the best show I have seen in Las Vegas yet   we have seen O  Ka  Mystere  Zumanity   If you are a Beatles music lover  you will enjoy it so much  I will say Encore is too far up the strip for our liking  I don t think we would stay here again unless the offer rate was really  really low again  We stayed at Wynn two years ago and would stay there over Encore in the future  again  only if the rate was low  Beautiful property  beautiful rooms  beautiful pools  staff could have been a bit friendlier  
N =>  Beautiful   star hotel but with   star service  I would certainly recommend the Encore   The rooms are huge and luxurious and it feels like every detail has been accounted for  For such a highly rated hotel however  the service is relatively poor  I arrived at the hotel in an oversized vehicle and was advised that the Wynn would account for the parking  This wasn t a hassle as the Wynn is next door  However on arrival at the Wynn  we were sitting in our vehicle and told to wait by hotel staff  approx    mins  for them only to tell us to go back to the Encore and park their  Cutting the long story short  we wanted a quick check in after a long journey and it took us over an hour overall to be instructed on where to park  Furious at this point  we proceeded to make a complaint at check in only to be told that the manager could not speak to us  When we were finally spoken to  we were given very little compensation at firsat but were eventually given      worth of food coupons and late check out   The maid service is poor and we had to phone twice on a   night stay and request they clean our rooms However despite the above  the hotel design and its facilities are amazing and i certainly would recommend it to anyone seeking an opulant Vegas experience  If you do arrive in an RV   GOOD LUCK    
N =>   Nice Hotel Location View   but not staying there again   Read MANY reviews before stay because we are very picky about the rooms bed  Upon arrival  we could not check in to hotel because of network issues  Had been down an hour before we were there and lasted another   hours  Once checked in  went to check out the room  Looked awesome  better than any other rooms we had stayed in  That evening pulled back the covers and there was a two stains on sheets and a few hairs which make me sick to think about it  It was so late we had not choice but to sleep on them  Cool buttons on outside of door that tell cleaners if you want privacy or room cleaned  Of course we wanted sheets cleaned  That night pulled back covers  bed was made  and same sheets   It was  am but we went to complain anyway  Hotel mgr said thier policy is to not change the sheets unless we request  We put in a request for each day to be clean sheets  Was very mad and decided to just keep sheets didn t want them in our room so we selected  quot privacy quot    well they came in our room anyway and made the bed   DID NOT CHANGE SHEETS AS REQUESTED BY HOTEL MGR   Seems like all they did was make the bed and give new towels  The counters in the bathroom were not wiped or anything else   Although we liked the hotel ok  and the location was fine we will not stay here again due to the room situation and also a biggie for us   not any eating places that are  quot normal quot  in the hotel  why not get a food court or something in Wynn or Encore   something besides a     and up meal  Beautiful hotel though   too bad   
N =>   Great hotel  We enjoyed our stay at the encore   stayed in a resort room   th floor          The room was beautiful and comfortable  Friendly staff  Good restuarants  Yes drinks and food are pretty pricey but we expected that b c its a   star resort  Highly recommend this resort  This place is also super clean  rooms and casino  Casino has great ventilation can t smell cigarette smoke  Its a large resort but not overwhelming  walking through the casino to elevators  dining  shops  clubs  ect  was rather easy  
N =>   be careful with noisy rooms I expect more from hotels like Encore which is highly rated  I was very very disappointed with our rooms because first of all    it s not a suite exactly even though the hotel advertised as a suite hotel  The room was slightly larger than regular hotel room but it is NOT a suite  Furthermore  my family stayed on   rd floor but we can still hear music from the club downstairs  It is a bit ridiculous  When I called downstairs  there was no help at all  The people at the front desk pretty told us we are on our own  It was just so disappointing  I had good experience staying at Wynn but with this visit at Encore  I will not return   there are plenty of choices for hotels who value my family as customers  
N =>   good hotel but expensive  Be prepared to wait and to walk Arrived at     pm on Sunday  Yes  I know check in time is   pm  but called the hotel prior to arrival and they said they would make a note requesting an early check in  Upon arriving  I was not the only one who desired to check in early  there were huge lines at registration  and it took me about   min to speak to an agent  only to be told that the room was not yet ready and I would receive a call when it was  Got my room at     pm  but it had been a long wait and there isn t much you can do when you are stuck with some luggage  Room is beautiful  casino is small but nice  food is expensive  also by the pool  but we had a very good dinner at the society cafe  We would have liked to have an affordable dining option within the hotel  now we went to the Superlux cafe at the Palazzo  which serves decent food for a good price  be aware that you will have to walk to go to the strip  first to the Wynn and through it s casino and shops  then you will see more beautiful  and expensive  shops before you get to see the daylight  Mind that you are not on the center of the strip  i e  if you want to walk to the MGM  it will take you   min  I wanted to try the excersise room  but the cost is      a day  which includes use of the Spa  I do not want to use the Spa  just the fitness  but that would still be    dollars  so no excersise for me while in Vegas  At checkout there was a line again  and it took me    minutes  The clerk was very apologetic  and told me the management is aware of the long line issue  Valet had my car up in    minutes  which was not bad  All in all  I would stay here again if I found a good rate  but for my next visit  I might give the Palazzo a try  
N =>   Very nice but unless you get great rate  go to Wynn or Palazzo We recently spent   nights at the Encore  Our previous stays in Vegas have been Wynn  Planet Hollywood  Palazzo  Westin  etc  We stayed at the Encore because we had received a great promotion  and at rate we had  we would consider going back  However  if rate was higher would not as we felt overall extra cost would not be worth it  Room was very nice as per previous reviews  We were upgraded to higher floor  panoramic windows  for an additional     per day  Casino is small  food at restaurants was expensive and quality not as good as expected  Checkin was quick but hotel was not anywhere near fully booked  Staff were nice  however we found staff at Wynn to be better  Drink service in Casino was slow compared to elsewhere  Location was fine for us at my wife likes to shop and Fashion Mall is across the street and Outlet is short cab fare away  However if you want to go to mid strip area it is quite a walk  Overall  hotel roms are a plus  pool is fine although we liked Wynn s better  If you want an upscale hotel and you can get good rate  consider the Encore  If rates go up  look at Wynn or Palazzo or even the new Vdara this fall 
N =>   They Wynn  you Lose My husband  amp  I did the Encore for a friend s   th bday  amp  my bday partying  Trip started nice  amp  I had read all of the neg reviews but wanted to go into the trip w  good intentions  that was thrown out the door by the first evening  There were   couples that traveled w  us  amp  we all stayed   the Encore on the same floor  but we still didnt have enough comp for anything   You need to spend at least   k in the casino to receive any comp     First off  the air conditioner didn t work during our   day stay  the ave temp in Vegas   the time was about     outside   We complained  amp  they brought up a service man        am on Sat morning mind you  so much for sleeping in   amp  he  documented  that he fixed it  but we continued to be uncomfortable  amp  woke up hot several times in during night s   Property is just beautiful  I will give them that  Mr  Wynn attends to fine detail  the decoration design is very impressive  amp  just fabulous  Wish I was as rich as Mr  Wynn Reality Checks   and we re not the complaining type      Other than the a c issue  our room wasn t cleaned for   days  They even sent up a maid to work out an alternative time for her to come back  amp  but she never returned  Really  Greg Goose  amp  Red bull in the casino       bucks  Diet coke by the pool      bucks  come on   the     amp  older pool simply does not have enough chairs for all the guests and my guess is that they do that purposely  You re not allowed to hold a chair for longer than    mins either  Laying by the pool was a pain in the buttock  it s basically a lounge where folks wear bathing suits and pretend their all models  The pool scene is totally plastic  The cabanas are rented out for      day  same w  the chairs lounges near the pool  they will set you back about           depending which lounge you re reserving  The pool waitstaff is clearly more interested in assisting a celebrity that happens to be there rather than getting the average guest anything from the bar  And don t bother bringing booz from your room to the pool  they ll bite you re head off  Turkey sand   the pool is definitely overpriced  go to Subway if you want a tightly wrapped sandwich in plastic  The chips  amp  guac were a joke      bucks and little more than nothing  And of course the famous bait  amp  switch room charge runs rampid during checkout  Every one of this   couple gang had problems checking out  amp  having the hotel guarantee the advertised rate during the summer promotion       promised       charged   Just remember to bring your email confirmation  We found the staff pretty condesending  We heard rumors that the reason the hotel staff is so rude b c management treats them that way so that s why they take it out on the guests  Ya know what  I really don t care  just serve me b c I paid for it  Basically  we thought this property was pretty high on itself  We won t be coming back no matter what the taxi drivers locals said about Mr  Wynn priding himself on customer service b c this place didn t have it  Stay somewhere else  you ll save yourself some    and have a much better time  On another note  my husband  amp  I were shocked to see so many young children   this adult playground  Why would you bring your kid to Las Vegas  We didn t get it cuz it s not a place for kids at all  
N =>   Almost but not quite    The Encore is a clean  decent hotel owned by Steve Wynn  It resembles the Belagio in certain ways but comes up short  As an adjunct to the Wynn it really doesn t have it s own distinct identity  Yes there are butterflies on just about everything but no defining personality  The pools are fine but not over the top like you expect in Vegas  They look as though they are part of a hotel built in the    s or a nice  quot motel quot  Both pools were extremely crowded and both blasted loud annoying music non stop  In fact  everywhere you went throughout the hotel there was the same loud  incessant music  It felt like a bad party where the host tried to compensate by blasting music We stayed in the tower section of the hoel  which means you have a special entrance  less crowded  and seperate elevators  The actual  quot tower quot  is in the same building but double doors block off the rest of the hallway from the  quot regular quot  hotel  The suite was large and clean and new  Floor to ceiling windows looked out at an abandoned construction sight and parking lot  Remember this was from a top floor in the front of the hotel  Most other places I ve stayed in Las Vegas all featured exciting views of the strip    so one has a sense of being out of the action  The truth is you are  The Wynn and the Encore are at the far end of the strip so that visiting most other casino s means a cab ride  As far as service goes it was well intentioned but off  For example  housekeeping would knock on our door despite our  quot privacy please quot  sign  In fact none of the hotel employees seemed to respect the  quot do not disturb quot   The engineering department merely knocked and entered despite the DND and even though I made it clear when I called them to please wait until dinner time to come fix the electric curtains  By the way  from the time we checked in  the curtains were either stuck open or stuck closed  The engineers would come up tell us everything was working properly and leave  It was frustrating trying to sleep with the sunlight streaming in when they were stuck open or sitting in a darkened room during the afternoon  There was also a sense of some of their guest being more special than others  One day we entered a room off the tower checkin area  It was supposedly a VIP area for tower suite guests  They offered soft drinks and snacks throughout the day  We walked in and were asked to show our special red tower suite cards  I felt slightly taken aback and embarrassed because the guard asked us in a rather loud voice in front of other guests  When we showed our cards we were told we needed to have a special gold star on our card in order to enter  We were forced to leave  It just made us feel tacky and not  quot special quot  enough  Anyway  bottom line  everything at the Encore was fine but not great  Nothing terrible but nothing really terrific  
N =>   Great hotel but not great service My husband and I invited some family to stay at the Encore for one week  In the past we ve been at the Wynn many times  at least once year since it opened Since they were our guests  all rooms were recorded under his name The last day we wanted to treat the women of the group with a massage  We booked the spa treatments  all five of us  under my husband s last name  giving different first names  because it was simpler  The lady at the reception   Yulia   informed us that my husband was the only one who could charge the treatments to the room  but that we could have paid with credit cards  No problem At the time of the treatment  coming directly from the pool where we spent the day  we were informed we needed IDs to be able to pay with the credit card  The same credit card had been accepted in the restaurants during the week  to pay for dinners much more expensive than the treatments we booked   no question asked The lady at the SPA reception   Isabel   insisted that  quot it was the law quot  that they requested an ID with a credit card  I reminded her that it s not  quot the law quot   but AT MOST a policy of the hotel   policy that didn t seem to apply consistently in all places Plus  the reason I use credit cards is EXACTLY because my purchases are protected and if there is a misuse I can deny the charge  Checking the document is of some use ONLY for the hotel  to protect itself and to avoid paying the credit card fraud insurance We weren t walking into the spa from nowhere  We were residing in the hotel  we provided all the information at booking time  and the lady who took our reservation should have told us we needed to have a document with the Credit Card  since I don t carry all my documents when I go to the pool and I leave my bag unattended Anyway  she was quite determined and not even the intervention of the SPA supervisor  Matt  resolved the problem  No document  no treatment We were so outraged that we decided to cancel the treatment and forget about it  That s not the way faithful clients should be treated We tried to complain to the hotel Manager  Christina  who wasn t rude  but she was icy  less than supportive and totally unapologetic  She should be fired even just for her dismissive attitude  To add insult to injury  our room was charged     of the cost of the treatments  since that s their cancellation policy  Now  someone has to explain to me how they could do THAT without any authorization  but they couldn t charge the whole amount Fortunately  after we complained  and spent another hour trying to get hold AGAIN of Christina  who at that point didn t even remember the issue   these charges were removed from our bill Other level of service complaints  mentioned also by others   horrible long lines for check in and check out  noisy rooms  Housekeeping servicing the room adjacent to ours in the middle of the night  including vacuuming Too bad because we love the property  we like the pool and we think that  by changing the attitude of some employees  the hotel manager in the first place   it would be a perfect spot for a Vegas holiday  
N =>  Memorable Experience at Encore We just returned home after   nights in Las Vegas at the Encore  From the moment we arrived we were mezmerized by the hotel decor  Having stayed at a few different hotels in Las Vegas  I was impressed by the fact that we didn t have to drag our bags through the whole casino in order to get to the registration desk  I find that to be very annoying and was glad that Encore was laid out differently  Our room was amazing  As Encore is a suites hotel  our suite was perfect  It looked exactly like the picture on the Internet  The only thing we couldn t preview before hand was the bathroom in our suite and again  we were pleasantly surprised  The staff were extremely friendly and attentive which only acted as a bonus to a fabulous hotel experience  The only downfall is that this is a luxury hotel  therefore  everything is expensive  a small bottle of water was    and     to use the Internet at the Business Center   Expect to pay loads of money for basic things  Other than that  it was definitely worth the stay and we highly recommend seeing the show La Reve while there and experiencing  quot The Buffet quot  at the Wynn  Both were amazing  In addition to this  the Spa is OUT OF THIS WORLD   
N =>  Wynn quality at its finest Went to Vegas for a three night getaway to celebrate my wife s b day  ided to give Encore a shot  as I have stayed at Wynn a few times and had an offer that we could not refuse Booked the room about   weeks in advance  no hassles as others have reported  no security deposit  no attempt to pressure an upgrade Check in went very smoothly  We were several hours early  but they had a room available  No pesky offer for a room upgrade at a special price  just a simple check in process that got us to our room quickly  The room was beautiful  Not as large as a Pallazzo or Venetian suite  but much nicer and more comfortable  Bathroom was well put together  plenty of room for both of us to bath and get ready to go out  Bedroom area was nice  although a touch small  Beds are the most comfortable I have had in Vegas  just amazing The Casino was also top rate  I love the concept of sepating the areas of gambling with curtains  made everything feel smaller than it is  The casino never had a crowded feeling that you get from other LV properties  even when the floor was buzzing before and after Beyonce shows  Dealers were very friendly  which is a nice touch Overall a very positive experience  will absolutely be going back  
N =>  Great Hotel We checked out of The Mirage to move to Encore and I am glad we did  This hotel is first class  Had a room on the   rd floor over looking the strip  What a view      Can t wait to go back Cab drivers in Vegas are a holes  
N =>  Awesome rooms beautiful hotel but very unaccommodating Had a group of    staying at the hotel for wifes birthday  The Hotel is beautiful  the rooms were awesome  but the staff was not very helpful  Check in system was down when we arrived and had to wait almost an hour to check in  They offered no comps  but instead gave us a bottle of water  Check out system was down when we left as well    could not check out from room either  another long wait  Concierge was of no help  Was on the wait list for a cabana at   pools        and never got one  They could not get us on the guest list for any of the clubs or throw us any perks  Very unaccommodating  I never heard  quot Sorry Sir  there s nothing we can do quot  more times in my life  Would not even give a late check out on Sunday  All in all an awesome hotel  but don t expect anyone to bend over backwards for you  
N =>  Too many issues to be truly   star Had issues  It began with check in which as a previous commenter noted  was pretty bad  Lines all the time  We thought we had a reservation that was giving us a complimentary upgrade to a King Suite  had it printed out and everything   But that didn t happen  And apparently the word  suite  is a touchy one in Vegas  The desk agent kept insisting the hotel is  all suite  but what we got just seemed like a  room    albeit a large one   but a room  Big and square  I ve been told that in Vegas if you get a sofa and a table  they call it a suite  I think of  suites  as being more than one room  ie  THEHotel   We talked to other folks at the pool who had issues at check in as well  One person said they had checked in with a confirmation on a room with two queen beds  but were told at check in no two bed rooms were available and they d have to pay     more for a rollaway  The front desk staff was a little dismissive of any problems issues in general  Not the way you would expect the desk at a   star to behave  The whole mini bar situation was pretty ridiculous  They have the  snacks  on top of some kind of metal plate that seems to send a signal that you should be charged if a snack is moved and not put back in a certain amount of time   I was warned about this and cut a wide path around the snacks and the mini bar   The restaurants in the hotel were all very expensive   even the takeout breakfast place charged    for a bagel with butter  Some of the food we got was even stale  But there was a sign posted outside the elevators saying no  off premises  food was allowed in the room  So forget takeout  Having said all this  the room itself  they can call it a suite if they want  to me it was a  room   was very nice  the bathroom lovely and spacious  The floor to ceiling windows in the room are quite stunning   Even if you get a room like we did above the pool area where the music from the nightclub could well keep you up till the wee hours  I m not sure whether I d stay here again though  It would have to be some deal I guess  
N =>  Just Okay The resort itself was very nice  The rooms are nice but the staff could be somewhat rude      to work out at the club  Are you kidding me  It seemed you could not take a step or a breath of air without being charged  Our first trip to Las Vegas and we were not impressed The town did not live up to all of the hype we have heard over the years  In summary  overpriced and overrated  What happens in Vegas should stay in Vegas and not permeate the rest of the country  
N =>  Avoid it like a cheap suit   I ve pasted below the email I sent the guest services at Wynn  We recently stayed at the Encore for   nights                and although I could let it pass as a bad experience  I didnt think it would be fare to not let the concerned authorities know  We chose to stay at the Encore as we thought it would be the epitome of luxury  and the tagged high dollar price       night  would be worth the experience  Although the King Suite we booked was nice and comfortable  the suite had no amenities whatsoever  The shocking thing was there isnt even a coffee tea maker  which is a standard amenity even at cheap motels  While other good properties on the strip provide a refrigerator for use  the one in our room had strict instructions not to use it for storing personal items  If we had to get a fridge in the room  there was another     day charge  The wireless internet in the room is not free  and the absolute worst is that we had to pay a fee for using the hotel spa facility  All this did make me wonder what did I pay the      a night for  Why would a supposedly top notch facility not even provide basic services like tea coffee  internet and spa services for free to high paying patrons  Anyway  after this sorry experience we are pretty much guaranteed not to stay at any Wynn property again  I thought I ll send my comments  hopefully they ll be reviewed and something will be done so more customers dont have such experiences Thanks  
N =>  Loved the Encore  I love Vegas and have stayed at every  nice  hotel  We stayed at the Wynn when they first opened and were not that impressed as we thought the Bellagio was still nicer  We decided to try the Encore because it is a bit smaller Service ranged from mediocre to outstanding  They were very busy the weekend I went  but no mishaps at all  Our room was lovely  and very nicely laid out  Great bathroom  comfy bed and nice to have a sitting area  We enjoyed room service for breakfast and thought it was tasty The casino is small  but so easy to walk over to the Wynn s casino  But the best part was the spa  We didn t get a service because it was pretty pricey  but we paid     to use the gym and all the spa facilities  It was worth every penny  The gym was the largest I ve seen in a hotel  with the latest equipment and cold water bottles at hand  The spa are was beautiful  with fruit  tea and water on offer  I spent a good   hours in the jacuzzi  cold pool  waterfall shower  dry sauna and spa shower  I finished the afternoon with a     smoothie  but that too was worth it We will stay again as our visit was relaxing  fun and delicious  
N =>   The best hotel in LV Everything was   stars except the service which wasn t bad but nothing to rave about  
N =>   Disappointing   not the   Star experienceexpected  Better Properties  Go to Vegas       times a year and usually stay at The Palazzo Venetian  Tried the Wynn Encore hoping to be wowed  but was very disappointed  Staff is generally rude and poorly spoken  Long time in check in line only to be told room may not be available till  pm or so  valet told me that late room availability is the norm   Room is nice but no wow factor that would justify its price  Housekeeping erractic  forgot to re stock toilet paper  no service one day  etc    Couldn t get the room cool enough to sleep  On a positive note is the room service menu and staff  Suggest you stay elseware   staff does not treat people well  certainly not as would be expected at a supposed   star property  
N =>   Amazing Spa Room and Pool    Casino was just fair Encore is the best place bar none to stay in Vegas  It was not my favorite place to gamble though  I prefer a more old school Casino  but the pool was great and so was the food  I will stay again  
N =>   Encore needs to take a mulligan We recently stayed at this hotel  It was a   th birthday present from my wife  The first impression is always the strongest impression  We arrived and had to wait about    minutes to register  I know that may not sound like much to you but the lobby was not crowded and at a premium hotel such as this guests should not have to wait at all  The only thing I remember from the registration was the clerk warning me not to lift any of the food in the bar area of our room because we would be charged for it  The key to our room did not work  We had to hail down a housekeeper who was unable to open the door who then called security  We had to wait approximately    minutes standing in front of our door with our baggage  Security finally unlocked our door  We then walked into a very nice suite with a very appealing flat screen TV  I wanted to watch TV but could not find the remote anywhere  I tried putting the TV on manually but it didn t seem to work  I then had to call the front desk and someone came up to our room with a remote about    minutes later  I complained to this person but he was not the least bit sympathetic  My wife also told me that two of the light bulbs were not working in the room  Hardly a memorable impression of our entree into the glamorous world of upper echelon Las Vegas hotels  The location of the hotel at the northern end of the strip is unfavorable  No monorail  Had to take cabs everywhere we went  Looking forward to my seventieth birthday at the Bellagio  Sent a similar review to the hotel and have not received a response  
N =>   Inconsistant experience Valet greeting was great  check in horrible  All checkin stations open  but all with long lines  We were upgraded automatically to an Encore Tower room with strip view  Room size was nice  huge bathroom with dual sinks  separate toilet  Huge closet  lots of drawer space  Only one luggage bench  View of strip consisted of  quot TI quot  sign and construction at the Palazzo      Better view of pool and golf course  Only one bed  but chaise lounge in sitting desk area good for me with a bad back  Only one TV   it swiveled  but kind of strange to have only one in a room of this nature    main gripes the pool closes between         Temp was     all week  we would have loved to go into the pool in the evening  but absolutely no access  Other problem is long walk thru esplanade to get back to Wynn  where most things are  buffet  restaurants  theater  Bad back again came into play   and no place to stop  amp  sit along the way  Ate most meals at the      bar near guest elevators  Good security at those elevators all day  Housekeeping does a wonderful job  Buffet was definately a let down from previous experience  both regarding food and wait times to be seated  Stood for    minutes despite multiple tables being empty and yes there were servers present   Most staff were very freindly  Would recommend hotel to those who don t like to swim and who love to walk  And what s with all the kids    
N =>   NO stay any where but here  NO NO  NO  Enjoy Vegas every year and this by far was the worst hotel with poor customer service all the way around  If you want to hear  NO   this is the place for you Check in any time  need to stop by the front desk  and check out is painfulfully slow for no apparent reason at all    encore takes  st place away from the DMV  Concierge  don t bother    we don t do this  we can t do that  our new policy is      We simply called our hosts from the last two years prior at Palazzo  amp  The Palms to set us us with VIP for everything at our own hotel   yes  encore   hmmmm  whatever  Maid service   sure at    pm  does that seem just a little late  What time do most poeple go to dinner  How can you get ready with a maid scurrying around your room  Insult to injury  turn down service then followed at  pm   what  Do I really need a turn down now OKay  maids for       hours are finally gone  jump into the shopwer   ice cold on a Friday night         Anyone need ice  just turm on your shower Saturday morning  not a drop of hot water to be found   heard the Wynn has hot water  we ll go to thier spa   no  we re not allowed    Saturday night still no hot water  finally at     pm a letter  oh good    we can now go to our spa  with no hot water   say what  Yes  that s right is was a mob scene of people looking to clean up nice for Saturday night without icles Ughhhh  Sunday head to the pool  find   chair left at  am   okay  get two more at   am  have lunch at the bar    feet from our lounges with all of our belongings still there  and the  pool boy  seats a hooker and geezer in our preciuos chairs while we dine on poor trailer food at outrageous prices    Fabulous  or NOT  There is plenty more  but enough is enough  I ve had an incredible experience every year in Vegas the past    years with a group that meet from around the world   This was nothing more than an EMBARRASSMENT  Palazzo is by far the superior location at this time  Looking forward to Mandarin  amp  Aria next year     STAY AWAY from encore  they don  even deserve a capital E the English language gives them and they certainly won t be earning it  
N =>   Good stay  Just got home after spending   days at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas  Very pretty lobby area  but rather small check in site  Check in was slow  and the lady was assisted us  cold and disinterested   it felt like she was doing us a huge favor  and when I asked her something about the deposit that I had already paid  she rolled her eyes upwards   Our rooms were not ready  but we did arrive earlier than check in time  so we were told to wait until we got a phone call letting us know that we could go to our rooms  So we took ourselves off for lunch to the Society cafe  which was decent  and had friendly service  We actually had breakfast there most mornings  and whilst expensive  it was decent  Finally received the call to tell us our rooms were ready  When my friend reached her room  the housekeeper was still busy in there and told her she needed at least    minutes more to clean the room   so much for it being ready  My room was ready  and very nicely appointed with good amenities and a nice view of the north side of the hotel  The bed was exceptionally comfy  and the shower did have hot water  The suite is smaller than those of the Palazzo Hotel  where I have stayed numerous times  but seeing as I was by myself it was adequate  However  if I were to travel with my husband  I wouldn t stay here as I prefer more room space  I placed wake up calls  and those came right on the dot  The mini bar and box are outrageously priced  so give these a miss   in fact  most of the restaurants and lounges in this hotel are very pricey  Ate at Botero in the hotel  which was superb and well worth the money spent  The waiter went out of his way to assist us with recommendations and I would most certainly return there  The only negative of this hotel on the whole  is the front desk staff    they can most certainly do with a course in  quot customer relations quot    and how to make the guest feel welcome and not like they should go elsewhere  
N =>   Fabulous We stayed at Wynn Encore for three nights as part of our honeymoon trip  It was our first time in Vegas and  in part due to Encore  we ll definitely be returning  We had booked in the Tower Suites  which has a dedicated check in  where we were given cold towels and water  Some other reviewers have said that they were treated badly when the staff saw that they had booked through other websites  but we had also done so and were treated exceptionally well  We don t know if it was because we mentioned that we were on honeymoon but we got a room on the   th floor   okay  the view was of the tail end of the Strip  which has little on it but to be able to look out over to the mountains was great  All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome  The food at the restaurants is on the pricey side but this is a five star hotel and you do have the choice of some     ranging from a coffee bar to two very high end restaurants  We also given a     credit towards food The main pool did a little crowded  but the  quot European quot  pool behind that had loungers spare and had a more upbeat vibe with its bar and couple of gaming tables Highly recommended  
N =>   Wouldn t go back Beautiful hotel  BUT  NO comp drinks at the bar while gambling  No comp drinks in Las vegas  never heard of it  Wouldn t go back for that reason  Everyone knows you are not going to come out a winner  but a couple of drinks would be nice  The bartender told us to gamble on the floor and a wait person would come and take our order  We waited for about an hour while throwing our money away  and we not waited on  We did try to get the attention of a server  but they paid no attention  Place looks nice  but would NEVER go back  How long are they going to stay in business without comping drinks while gambling at the bar  I only hope other hotels don t follow  Las vegas will not survive  
N =>  Worst hotel experience in Las Vegas My stay at the Encore Las Vegas was by far my worst hotel experience ever  I picked Encore solely due to the fact that they claim to be a   star hotel and I was expecting high class service  I was very dissapointed to say the least Issue      I checked in with   of my friends and we booked a   queen beds room  the hotel manager said they only had rooms with one king bed left  They expected   grown up men to sleep on one bed  They would not do anything to accommodate us and wanted to charge us an extra     a night for extra roll out beds Issue     The hotel manager treated us like dirt due to the fact that we booked our room through a package via expedia com  She said  quot We wont pay extra attention to you because you paid a lower rate through expedia com quot   Basically if you book through expedia rather than paying      a night through their website they will treat you like crap  Issue     They promised us a strip view however  after we checked into our room we had an amazing view for an empty lot and abandoned construction site Issue     The hotel bathroom smelled like something died in there  The smell was unbearable  Our neighbors complained of the same thing so it was not just our room  Issue     The hotel casinos were virtually EMPTY with almost no waitresses at all for serving drinks  On several occasions late at night we were being solicited by hookers while gambling  I would expect security to be tighter at this hotel  iSSUE    The hotel pool did not have enough chairs  Also the pool is as big as the one you would find in a holiday inn  Bottom line I would never stay at this hotel again  please take my advice and stay at the Bellagio or any other hotel at the strip for that matter  Staying at the Encore would almost guarantee that you will never return to Vegas again  
N =>  Presidential  We stayed here   nights after a bachelor party and we were offered the presidential suite at a heavy cost so we thought why not It s hard to describe but it was straight out of a movie   the suite had   floors  private elevators  full strip view  pool room  kitchen  double storey lounge  Scarface esqe  and it came with our own Butlers  They did everything for us  Iron own clothes  pour my drinks  send my faxes  I almost felt bad It had   bedrooms all en suite   I mean this place was a million times better than half the places you see on MTV Cribs I m considering getting it again if I can get a good price  
N =>  Beautiful resort but they ll nickel and dime you My wife and I check into Encore for our anniversary in a resort suite with a free upgrade to a Panoramic Suite  When we arrived we were told there were no more panoramic suites available and were offered a room on the   th floor overlooking the pool  Roughly the worst location possible  given noise from XS  we declined and asked for something higher up and got a room on the   th floor facing the Riviera  It s disappointing that a   star resort would not honor the room you booked and offer you a worse room  not a better one  After speaking to a manager we were offered a late check out  which was fine  but didn t really make up for not getting the correct room  The room we got was fantastic nonetheless  bed was very comfortable  and overall we were VERY impressed with our suite  Unfortunately the pool is too small for the weekends and was extremely crowded  but was easy to get a seat on weekdays  and Sunday   The real bummer about Encore is that everything is just so ridiculously priced  Our poolside snacks    sandwiches  chips  amp  salsa   ran us about      A bowl of cereal from room service was    dollars after the  delivery fee      buffalo wings were      I understand that hotels charge more than general  but this was absurd  To make matters worse  it s a pretty decent walk to get anywhere else to get some food  so you are definitely captive to whatever Encore charges We ate at Switch and it was wonderful  as well as the cafe at Wynn  which was also very good  The lobby bar at Encore had good coffee  About      for a small  and danishes       Overall the property is amazing and the rooms are great  it s just too bad the staff don t honor reservations and the food is so expensive  
N =>  Very pretty but everything priced very steep We stayed here for our honeymoon from e    y    Hotel and casino are beautiful  our room was nice  comfy bed  pretty bathroom but terrible view of Circus Circus and the Riviera  Try to get a room that faces the strip  Hotel is way to far away from everything else on the strip  I would recommend staying somewhere in the middle of the strip  I can say I have stayed there  but when we go back to Vegas we will stay somewhere like Mirage or MGM  you ll get more your money and be in a better location  
N =>  Not up to expectations This was a disappointing experience from check in to departure Check in desk person had an attitude issue and started out our stay poorly  I am sure the lousy location of our room was her way of expressing her power over our stay  We had a lovely view of the roof with huge spotlights to light our stay  Just lovely A warning siren went out on the first day and continued to shreik the same message for    minutes We had no A C the first night and awoke to a system wide failure on Day   that resulted in cold showers that morning and that evening before dinner  A letter from Mr  Wynn stated it was the only time in his history such a thing has happened  Just there at the right time apparently Food was overpriced for quality and portion size  A very small bowl of fresh berries in the cafe had a       price tag and a veggie omellette was        And it was indeed just the omellette  not even served with a slice of toast  I had to ask three people to get a cup of coffee and the restaurant was almost empty Luckily  we were close to the Capital Grille and Postrio at the Venetian so were able to enjoy two nice dinners with excellent food and service Pools undersized for a resort of this size Very little in the way of personal service We are not fans of Las Vegas but expected to be wowed at Encore  It was a yawn  
N =>  Very Enjoyable Stay Had a really enjoyable   night stay at the hotel  Got a      rate with     resort credit       gaming credit  The check in was quick on a  pm Sunday afternoon on e    was offered an upgrade to a panoramic room for     extra a night  but declined The rooms are really nice  very comfortable bed and good bathroom  Although a  quot suite quot  the standard encore room is about the same size as a Wynn panoramic room Housekeeping was good and the room was cleaned well each day  When I checked in there was a problem with a loose toilet seat     but this was repaired the following day  So that was good Plenty of elevators  so no queuing   crowding unlike other vegas hotels  mandalay bay  I m talking to you The pool area was good  use the european area to get away from the kids  Whilst I was there the staff we removing towels  so no lounger hogging was going on  which is good  The pool was never crowded  probably due to unusual e temperatures in the    s rather than the     s  It looks quite a small area  however having later stayed at the mirage  it s about the same size as their pool  but not as big as Mandalay Bay  but I think that s the biggest  Had a good dinner at Wazuzu so would recommend that  but not that impressed by Sinatra  fantastic presentation but taste didn t match up  Society Cafe s breakfast menu wasn t great  other than the ultimate steak sliders which were fantastic  service was patchy  if well meaning The only downside was the sound proofing  yes you can hear your neighbours  But for me only on a couple of occassions  and XS if your room faces the pool  It s that low level  barely audible noise that you get from the club  but you know it s there it does irritate  My tip is to bring your ipod and use in in room ipod dock and play it quietly so your noise covers their noise Location wise you are on the end of the centre strip  but I would recommend a trip to the peppermill a couple of blocks north for real vegas kitch experience  South seas Flamingos and purple neon  real old vegas  bonkers I would definitely stay there again if the rates were good  but if they got back to        levels then I would probably have to think about it Overall it appears you get either a good or bad stay at encore  there s no middle ground  no such thing as an OK stay  Overall I would put my stay in the good category  
N =>  Nice interiors average food terrible customer service In general hotel was nice and clean  rooms are big and well apointed The biggest problem is a customer service  It took us   hours to check in  after the advertised check in time  As it was mentioned in previous reviews  they promise to call you shortly as soon as the room is ready  which never happens Only after going through several layers of management  listening to the explanation like  quot  should you folks opt for the smocking room instead you would be accomodated right away quot   our foult we don t smoke  we ve got our room eventually Then it took another hour and a half and several telephone calls to get the luggage from the bell desk  Overall   nice start The following day we didn t get room service at all The instruction was to push service button on a side of the entrance door We did so   times during the day   nothing happened When I call houskeepers around  pm they told me that it was all my foult since I should call them to inform when we are leaving the room  Most people don t have this problems even in   star roadside motel The best dining in Encore  Wynn is buffet  ent price for decent food We tried   so called  quot fine dining quot  restaurants   it was a joke Don t waist your money there   you ll get buffet left overs  supposangly prepared by famous shefs  unprofessional  basic service and pay for this dearly  
N =>   I Don t Think We ll Go Back We stayed at Encore this past weekend to celebrate my husband s birthday  We expected everything to be perfect at a Wynn property  but it was far from it  First  when I called to make our reservations  the agent said they would make a note of my husband s birthday  and the hotel would send a basket of some sort to our room  Also  when we checked into the hotel  the desk agent again said they would be sending something to our room to acknowledge DH s birthday  We were there from Friday afternoon until Monday afternoon  and nothing arrived at our room  Thank goodness I hadn t told him to expect anything from the hotel  Second  there was the issue of not having any hot water Saturday  Although we received a     credit on our invoice  we still can t believe something like this could happen at Encore  To say the showers we took that day were  cold  would be an understatement   Third  we dined in room Saturday evening  When we placed our order at       we were told our meals would arrive at       At      we received a call saying our food would be delayed another   minutes  It was much longer than   minutes  our food didn t arrive for over an hour  We were charged        for a couple of pizzas  so the least they could have done was to deliver them on time   Fourth  Sunday  which was DH s birthday  as well as being Father s Day  we tried to eat at the buffet  starting at      pm  We waited in line for over an hour and were still nowhere even close to the cashier  I understand that a larger number of guests than usual dined there because of Father s Day  but that wasn t the issue  Guests should have been told when they joined the long line that the wait was almost   hours  As it was  after we waited in line so long and realized we still had an equally long wait  we finally just left and went somewhere else to have lunch  Last but not least  charging for wifi at a luxury hotel is just wrong  It s a part of everyone s daily lives now  so it should be included in the room charge  the same as a telephone is  All these issues could   and should   have been avoided  I understand it takes time for a new hotel to work out the bugs  but Encore has been open long enough that things like these shouldn t be happening  
N =>    only stay here going forward Checked in at    a m  Saturday e   th  Room wasn t ready  which was expected that early  Wasn t offered the upgrade that many have wrote about  Wasn t going to accept it anyway  We were on the   th floor with a view out the back towards the mountains  Strip would have been cool at night though but no complaints  We were told about the water main break in the hotel when we arrived but didn t affect us because by the time we went to use the shower at   after using the pool it was fixed and still got the    dollar credit for the inconvienance Room was very clean with a great modern clean look  Casino and lobby had a very high end feel  Lots of natural light  I liked that no matter how much you were playing they asked for your card so they could rate you  we were playing    dollars normally a spin on roulette and they wanted our card  At the Bellagio last year  even playing    dollar a hand blackjack nobody ever asked for our card Pool at Encore was great atmosphere  We used the adult pool and service was excellent  always a waitress ready to take your order  Drinks were expensive but they are marked in the menu  Nobody is forcing you to buy them  What we had was very good  Didn t order any food because it looked pre made  Ate lunch at The Country Club in the Wynn  Great spot  even better prime rib sandwich  That sandwich will be part of me vegas itinerary going forward Had dinner at Bartolotta  Good not great  We did multiple seafood pasta dishes and while the fish was very fresh  the pasta was just ok  Sea Bass tortelini was not memorable and risotto with clams  calamari  etc  was way to buttery  The inside setting was kind of blah  we got a table outside near the lagoon so that was very nice but I would have not eaten there if I couldn t get the outside table  I would have hit up B amp B in the Venetian Palazzo  Ate there is ust     had   entrees  one better than the next Encore has a great location  connected to Wynn  which connects to Pallazo via sky bridge  Did XS club on Sunday night  great indoor outdoor setup  Encore gave us free passes  would have been    for me     for my wife without it  Drinks are expensive     dollars for   Miller Lites  But a cool expierence  Club has dancers everywhere and they are trying to make it a pool party but    percent of people are unaware and don t show up ready to swim  We left at       so who knows what happened after that All in all excellent stay  In ust    stayed at Bellagio but wanted to try something different this time  next time I won t want to try something different  
N =>   Why didn t I read these rip off reviews first  My wife and I  frequent Las Vegas visitors but new to the Encore  got caught in the front desk  quot upgrade scam  quot  We were told that for     dollars extra we would be upgraded to the  quot Tower Suites quot  We were promised a suite with floor to ceiling windows  private entrance  separate pool  this pool is located all the way in the Wynn a long walk in wet bathing suits  Sounded like a great deal so we did it  When we left our room we decided to see what the room we were scheduled to get looked like  You guessed it  the room was exactly the same  It was a suite  with floor to ceiling windows  In other words  they got us  I can t believe Steve Wynn condones this  He seems like such a great guy who really changed the face of Vegas with the opening of the Mirage  We were so pissed at being taken we checked out the next morning and went to another hotel where they know how to treat customers  Front desk manager was overwhelmed with irate customers when we went down to complain  The place is gorgeous but they have a lot to learn about taking advantage of customers  
N =>   I was scared at first but it was awesome  I read the TripAdvisor reviews religiously  so I was more than scared about staying at the Encore after all the customer service complaints  especially because we got such a cheap rate through Orbitz    nights and RT airfare for   from Chicago for        I thought for sure we d be put in the basement  if in a room at all So  I wasn t surprised  but did have a sinking feeling  when we arrived on Sunday to check in and were told our room wasn t ready   it was  pm   well past check in time  It was especially maddening because the person being checked in next to us not only got a room  but was asked about upgrading to a higher floor for     night  They offered to call us when a room became available  and having done this at other hotels and never gotten a call back  I wasn t planning on that phone call  but checking in again after a beer  Anyway  we went to the bar with our luggage to wait   and all I could think was that at least these free nuts are good  we had two bowls   About    minutes after arriving my husband got a call apologizing for the room not being ready and asking if we d like a complimentary upgrade  Man  did things change from there   we were checked in immediately to the   st floor with an amazing view of the Strip  Everything from then on was awesome   housekeeping answered immediately when I requested our sheets be turned down   the concierge didn t treat me like an idiot  and also answered on the first ring  when I called to ask how to open the curtains  The room had these great robes  and TV in the bathroom and I could have just spent the trip alternating between the shower and the fluffy comfy bed  The pool is absolutely incredible   the bloody marys to die for   and every single staff person we came into contact with was friendly  accomodating  and very helpful  I would definitely recommend others to stay there  especially if you get the kind of rate we did   having stayed at multiple places on the strip  this was by far the finest    
N =>   HORRIBLE customer service Please spend your money elsewhere  My experience here was horrible  I noticed when trying to book my room through the Wynn Encore website that it didn t give you an option of  K or  Q beds  So before booking the room through the website  I called the front desk at Encore and asked them how I can specify that I want  Q beds  I was told to put a note under the comments that I want  Qs  I even called the morning I was leaving for Vegas and the representative confirmed I will be getting a room with  Q beds  I got to the hotel and was told they do not have a  Q room available to me but a complimentary roll away bed will be sent to our room within the next few minutes  We waited for over an hour until we decided to call housekeeping and they told us they will be bringing one over within the next half hour     min later   nothing  We called again and housekeeping would not pick up  so we called guest services and were told we would get the roll away soon  Since we were going out that evening  we told them they can enter the room and leave the bed there  We came back at  am and there was still no extra bed  We called housekeeping and they finally fessed up that they have no more roll aways available  That was all the explanation we got from them  So we spoke with one of the hotel managers  probably an assistant manager  and all he kept offering us was a     resort credit for the inconvenience  After he got the point that we were still very upset and would much rather get our second bed  SUDDENLY there just happened to be an available room with  Q s at  am  The fact that it took that much work to get our well deserved  nd bed is ridiculous  PLEASE DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS HOTEL  I have NEVER had such a problem at the Venetian and Palazzo  
N =>   NO HOT WATER    Worst experience  We checked in on Thursday  After we come back from pool on Friday afternoon  there was no hot water   We complained and waited more than   hour then finally hot water came out  On saturday  from morning to late afternoon  there is totally no hot water  we had   babies can not take hot shower  they only gave us         what a FXXX  AT least they should give us money back for one night   customer service was worst person to talk to in the hotel     it was worst experience   by the way  no hot water at pool  spa  and everywhere   
N =>   Glitchy My wife and I stayed at the Encore Tower Suites        for our anniversary  I had booked directly through the hotel website to take advantage of good rates and a resort credit package Let me preface the review by mentioning that we have stayed in most of the hotels on the Strip over the years so I have a reasonable perspective for comparison  I ll also mention we experienced the hot water problem noted in other reviews   more on that later  From what I gather  the Tower Suites operate as a  quot hotel within a hotel quot  as the checkin desk described  catering to only a few hundred guests  It appears the Tower consists of the     rooms on each floor on the west end of the Encore hotel The Good   we arrived on Friday evening around       so we had the usual airport congestion and road traffic  One of the best features of the Encore Tower Suites is the separate portico entry outside and separate lobby check in  This was WONDERFUL  Staff was very professional and made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped out of the cab  Bell staff was great and the front desk was uncrowded and very nice  When asked about the nature of our stay  we mentioned it was our anniversary and were later that night pleasantly surprised to find a wonderful chocolate tray with  quot Happy Anniversary quot  on it  with a nice handwritten card from the desk  Very nice touch  Overall the checkin was perfect   cool towels and bottled water to boot  That alone might make the Encore Tower Suites worth the upgrade  We also had spa treatments  and the Encore spa is the best I ve used  Very very nice and relaxing We were on the   nd floor which offered stunning views of the Wynn and down the strip  The floor to ceiling windows were outstanding  Other reviewers have posted pics and described the rooms  Overall  very clean  modern  with the remote control light  drape and privacy sign controls right near the bed  Very cool  Bathroom was excellent  In room safe was a nice feature Minor annoyances   a few things were mildly annoying for a hotel positioned in this class of service  On check in I was asked if I would like a complimentary paper in the mornings  I said  yes   the NY Times  The desk said they would be delighted to provide that  I never did receive it  only the local LV paper  Also  the lovely chocolate plate mentioned above was charged to my bill  I don t expect too many freebies at a hotel like the Encore  but I didn t ask for nor approve of the charge  This annoyance was offset by the fact that we enjoyed the plate but nonetheless it was a bit presumptive  Also there were times when our phone did not connect to any hotel services   front desk  concierge  nothing  And our cell phones did not work in the hotel  we use T Mobile and the bell staff said TMo and Verizon do not seem to work inside the hotel  Major annoyances   OK  our experience with the hot water  Friday evening we were readying to go out to dinner and   no hot water  I called the front desk and they confirmed that the whole hotel was without hot water with no estimated time for a fix  So we went out as is  without showering   just some basic cleanup with cold water  The next morning   still no hot water and we had Spa treatments scheduled  Many treatments were canceled for the day as the spa had limited to no hot water either   only a shower or two  The steam room was working  The hot tubs were not hot  My wife s pedicure in the salon was with tepid water  The spa did offer     off the treatments we were able to do  which was a nice gesture Back in our room  we had oil and spa residue in our hair and on our bodies   still no hot water  Later in the afternoon there was a note from Steve Wynn in the room explaining that there was a major water line problem that would take until the evening to fix  The letter stated he and the staff were embarrassed and they were offering a     credit for the inconvenience  We kept trying the hot water in our room and it finally came back late evening  We were never notified of the estimated time to fix or that it was indeed back on  This problem was limited only to the Encore  as the Wynn kept hot water service throughout Upon checkout  my bill was about      over what I was expecting  We had used room charging for most activities such as dining and the spa  but it was very much more than expected for such a short trip  The package I booked was a pre pay  but the room was listed again each night for nearly double the rate I had agreed to pay  and had in fact paid already   The front desk seemed a bit confused and I had to dig around and find my online reservations and receipt  In the end  they found the real pricing but were unable to explain why they had added the room charges again to my bill  Again  while they apologized I felt like I had to sort of argue with them to get this understood and fixed  So why   out of   stars  Service overall was good  The staff seemed to try hard to greet you  open doors  make you feel welcome  etc  Again  the separate entry and check in is wonderful for the Tower suites  But this is not an inexpensive resort so to me it s fair to have high expectations  Even discounted room rates aren t trivial for a weekend getaway and I felt like I was being nickel and dimed  or in the case of the Encore Wynn    quot tenned and twentied quot   for everything  Dining is pricey  A typical mixed drink at the bar out by the pool was      strawberry margarita  non top shelf   The hot water issue  while it could happen to any hotel    hasn t ever happened to me at any other hotel  And during the entire problem  we felt like we were just supposed to guess what to do next  Really bad communication and I guess not enough      quot humility quot   from the resort  In the end  when I stay at a hotel I want a nice comfortable place to sleep and a place to get clean and ready to go about my trip  The bed indeed was nice  But spending the majority of our trip without hot water to shower or shave and have no sense of when it would be fixed  and then no substantive acknowledgement that this negatively impacted quests was a major turn off to the Encore  The hotel has so much potential and I wanted very much to find perfection there  But in the end it was too inconsistent  too pricey in the wrong places  too   glitchy to recommend  I went away not having enjoyed my stay as much as I had wanted  If the hot water issue had not occurred  I might have rated the hotel a   out of   but still would have keep looking for another higher end resort For the bottom line money I spent  I expected to walk away having found our new LV destination  We ll have to keep looking One other note that may be factoring into my Encore Wynn experience  We booked  ahead of time  a patio table at the Daniel Boulloud restaurant at the Wynn  I wanted to enjoy the quirky Lake of Dreams shows with dinner  The restaurant was fine  but our table   while on the patio   was crammed back into a service corner with no view of the lake  To boot  in the middle of the second LOD show  the show stopped abruptly  crashed  and that was that  Glitchy  
N =>   Absolutely Perfect We stayed here for a week in  and it was amazing  The check in was swift and polite but friendly  the lifts were easy to find  and our standard room was incredible  We didn t have amazing views   th floor   North Strip towards Fremont Street  but this didn t matter  it was still lovely  The bathroom was great  and the bed was SO comfortable We went to the pool most days  and the free towels and iced water were perfect for the first few hours  after which we moved over to the pool bar to get some shade and drinks  The pool is perfect  not too cold but cold enough to cool you down  and the sunloungers were very comfortable We ate at the Terrace Restaurant  Wynn  for breakfast and lunch a few times and had varied service  although to be fair this varied between good and great   Don t eat outside if you don t like birds tho  there are sparrows everywhere  although they always seemed to wait until you d finished with your meal  which was polite I thought   We also ate at Botero on our last night and although it s a steak house they provided excellent vegetarian food for me  with some advance warning  I had intended to try a spa experience  but as the exchange rate wasn t so great for us I changed my mind  but the facilities looked lovely Location wise it was fine  opposite Fashion Show Mall  so walking distance to some of the other hotels  and easy enough to get a bus or a taxi to the others  we walked to Bellagio and back one day  which  at   months pregnant in    degree heat  was my limit  All in all I would love to stay there again if we ever go back to Vegas  
N =>   The Fish Stinks from the Head My wife and I just returned from a three night stay at Encore                The stay started out well  Check in went smoothly and we upgraded to a slightly larger room on the   rd floor that was nicely appointed and included a panoramic view of Las Vegas through floor to ceiling windows  Being a new hotel  the room had some nice amenities  such as bedside controls for the blinds and curtains  You can also request privacy or maid service from the bedside controls As other reviewers have stated  the pool experience is subpar  even for a lesser hotel  The waitress service in the euro deck area was sometimes non existent and we had to go to the bar three times ourselves to get drinks and food  They were out of several food items and even some of the supplies need to make all of the standard drinks on the menu  When you do get the food  it is disappointing to see that it is standard pre packaged food that you would find at a large grocery store chain  Friday afternoon  things headed downhill  Upon returning to our room around  pm after a day of shopping  we discovered that there was no hot water  We contacted the front desk and were told that the hot water was out in the entire tower and the problem was being worked on  At   pm there was still no hot water  which was a big disappointment because  given that it was Friday night  we had to scrap our plans to have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a club  Saturday morning we awoke around     am and retrieved a voice message from our phone from the hotel management that was left around     am indicating that the hot water problem was still being worked on  but that hot water was expected to be restored by early afternoon  By the time we checked out at  pm there was still no hot water  Thus  there was no hot water for at least    hours and counting At checkout we asked to speak to a manager about the lack of hot water and were offered     credit per person  I asked to have a credit for the full Friday night room charge  which was       but they would not give us anything more than           for each of us   My wife and I left Encore very disappointed  We should be clear that we have no issue with the fact that the water problem occurred that can happen anywhere  The problem we had was that the hotel management was not proactive in doing something for the guests who had been staying at the hotel and had no hot water for    hours  Furthermore  when confronted with the issue at checkout  all that was offered was a     credit per person  I had wondered aloud to my wife whether Steve Wynn  the owner of the Encore  knew about the water problem  given how many people were affected possibly hundreds  The front desk manager told me that he indeed was personally aware of the problem and that he was the person who decided to offer the     per person credit and nothing else  So  this issue which affected the stay of so many people was in fact raised to the highest level of management What could they have done different  I am not in the hotel business  but several things come to mind  Instead of waiting until checkout to offer a paltry credit  they could have invited the guests to eat at the buffet  or perhaps visit the spa and use the showers there  I later learned that the spa had hot water   Instead they chose to do nothing other than to acknowledge the problem and provide an update on when it might be fixed  even after    hours with no hot water  The owner and management of Encore exercised poor judgment by not proactively addressing the problem and instead waiting until guests checked out to offer the     credit  which did not even cover the room charge  This was very disappointing from a hotel that claims to be the best Las Vegas has to offer  Because of this incident  my wife and I will likely not return to Encore or the Wynn  While both hotels are nice  our concern is that if another event occurs that requires management intervention  that the issue would not be resolved with the best interests of the guest in mind I will conclude by saying that there s an old management saying that  The fish stinks from the head   Given that  according to the front desk manager  Steve Wynn himself knew of the problem and offered the     credit at checkout  the saying certainly applies  
N =>   NO HOT WATER Checked in on a Friday afternoon  all was going well until night time when the hot water went out  Luckly we showered after we got back from the pool  The hot water seemed to have gone out some time before midnight  Friday night   So  here we are     pm  Saturday evening and still no hot water  We called and complained about it and asked for at least one night be taken off our bill and nothing  The hotel managers said the best they can do is give us a        concession  We called and complained   times during the day and still nothing  Customer service was terrible  basically said  quot too bad their is no hot water  it will come on when it comes on  quot I stopped gambling here and can not wait to check out of this hotel  DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL    
N =>   Very Disappointing Stayed at this hotel but was not as I hoped  Upon check in    girls  we were toldthat they only had king size beds  Cots were available but took three extra phonecalls and arrived close to   a m  Stayed on the side where you could see the poolsand Las Vegas from the   st floor  The noise from the night club  constant pounding went until   am every morning  Several calls down to change rooms with no response The hotel is a beautiful property but lack of interest in what customers are concernedabout was very apparent  Upon check out voiced my concerns again but was toldthat the manager was too busy to see us  Have sent a e mail to customer serviceon our return and have yet to hear from them Very Disappointing   
N =>   Non smoking room is only a request not guaranteed My only complaint at the Encore was that non smoking rooms were not available per my request when I checked in at  pm  I had to upgrade       per room  per day in order to get the type of room that I had requested  
N =>   Overrated Went to Vegas to celebrate our    year anniversary  notified the hotel of our celebration when we booked it  but it was never acknowledged during our stay  We reserved a King bed  nonsmoking  but it was not available when we checked in  so we had to move to another room the next day  Our first room  was on the   nd floor  and you could hear the base thumping from club XS all night  The rooms are beautiful and clean  It is nearly impossible to find   lounge chairs by the pool on the weekend  which is smaller than most  Great place for people watching  though  That said  I prefer the MGM Signature  The location and service are better there  and the rooms just as nice  
N =>   bait and switch  rate quoted not honored  after booking the reservation  i called back at a later date to find out if rates had gone down  i was told they had and was quoted a new lower rate  upon checkout  no evidence of this was found  i was told to go home and find documentation  of course  it s impossible to constantly do everyone s job  so i found i had no email documentation of this new lower quote and had not caught this omission  after one phone call to customer service that was not returned after   weeks  i called again  i was told that it would be looked into  but no matter what was found  no corrections would be done now  only   weeks after my stay  boy  do i feel duped  terribly customer service  
N =>   Encore was Fantastic  Stayed at the Encore Sunday e  th thru Thursday e   th  We had absolutely perfect stay  Pulled up At Valet and were greeted with cheer  amp  repsect  Bellman unloaded everthing  amp  for two girls we had   heavy bags  he just smiled  amp  said it was pretty normal  Check in was a breeze  only waited about      minutes  We had requested a room with two queens and were a little concerned after reading many reviews that they would not have one available  They did  amp  we chose to upgrade to a panormaic view for        a night as we wanted the highest floor possible  amp  our assigned room was on the   th floor  Got the   th floor  room       ther are only    floors I believe  The view was awsome   could see the the strip as well as the golf course  amp  were directly across from the Wynn sign so the pictures looked great  The room was fabulous    of the most comfortable beds ever   really big sitting area with couch      quot m plasma TV that moved out from the wall to angle towards the living area TV also had DVD player  The bathrom was huge with seperate shower  amp  tub  The heated tile floor was great on cold feet  Loved that it had a huge double sink with vanity  as girls we are always vying for counter space  The TV in there was great as well   I love watching TV while I get ready  There was a doorbell and buttons to push if you wanted privacy or room cleaned   no need to worry that someone ripped your tag off the doorknob  There is a decent sized closet with a dresser  amp  room safe  They of course have the overpriced honor bar  amp  I did have one    sprite but other than that no mistaken charges for anything as I have read in other reports After we checked out the room we called the Bell desk for our luggage   it was there in   minutes  There is turn down service    many people have said there is not   you have to call  amp  request it   we did every night before we left the room  Every night when we came back there were slippers by our beds   chocolates   and a good night bookmark  They also would replace any used towels  amp  restock any toiletries we had used between maid service  amp  turn down There have been numerous reports of noise from the rooms next door  amp  from Club XS down stairs  We did not hear a peep  No thumping or noise of any kind  amp  our room was directly above the club  Completely peaceful We ate at Switch  Society Cafe   amp  Wynn Buffet all Superb   All in all our stay was the best we have had yet in Vegas   even topping Bellagio  amp  the Venetian  Next time we will try the Wynn as we have not stayed there yet but would stay at Encore again in a heartbeat  
N =>  Nickel and Dimed Bad experience but a lovely hotel  Upon checkin I was informed that the room I had reserved with two queen beds and Non Smoking was not available and could not be gauranteed at the time I booked it three months prior  They offered to  quot Upgrade quot  me to the room which I had originally booke for an additional     n but it would be a Smoking room  What crooks  I refused  I asked to cancel my reservation and they magically waved the     n fee to keep my business  They still stuck me in a Smoking room and promised to call me on my cell when a Non Smoking room became available  I never got that call  The hotel charges     day to use the spa even if you are a guest  They charged     day for internet use  The offer I had included a     dining credit which was NOT reflected on my bill at checkout  There is no sportsbook in the Encore and it is a    minute trek to the Wynn Sportsbook  I deeply regret booking the Encore and should have heeded the advice of trip advisor users  I do not understand why a   star resort would nickel and dime their customers  When I return to Vegas in ember I will stay at Bellagio  
N =>  Unfortunately not what I was hoping for We just returned from a weekend at Encore  I have stayed at every five star hotel in Las Vegas and I was very eager to try Encore Even from before I got there  things went wrong  My girlfriend called the hotel as it was my bday and she wanted to buy a bottle of nice champagne  chcolate covered strawberries  balloons and a birthday cake  They told her they can t create this type of surprise as they have      rooms and it s too hard to do this  I have done and received surprises from to her at many five star properties and have never received this type of response  I was pissed from the start When we got to the room  I have to be honest it didn t wow me like a standard room at the Palazzo or the Four Seasons  I stayed in a salon suite at the Wynn before and that was truly amazing and the service was great The following things were problems in the room the second we got in The surprise that they wouldnt doThe make up mirror did not illuminate as it is supposed toThe shower cap box was emptyThere was a large stain on the marble counter top from someone s left over drinkI asked to be move to a larger room type for our inconveniences  I was not afraid to ask for this as we truly deserved it  Their response was oh we are sold out sorry  Overall  Encore needs to get it together and recreate the promised five star experience  The location is really too far from EVERYTHING  I would stay at the Wynn     x over Encore  
N =>  Nice Hotel Service was average at best When one says they are the best of the best  I expect them to back that up  But they didn t Good  nice hotel  rooms are decorated modern  casino nice to look at  pool is great as wellThe restaurants and bars are fabulous as well Bad  No coffee in the room  the snacks in the room have a sign stating that if you remove anything for more then    seconds  you will be charged for it  They do this by the weight Everything is expensive  no surprise here  Worse  We had   rooms booked with queens  desk said too bad  since the fine print does not grantee this  even though we called back after making the reservations to double check  Manager said same thing  and that there was nothing he could do  Wasn t too apologetic either  Had that  I don t care attitude Waited   hours for our server to finally come back to us at the pool for a drink order    hours  
N =>  Beautiful Hotel limited gambling great customer service  Wanted to stay somewhere where the gambling wasn t the big deal  as that tends to get crowded  roudy and a bit overwhelming  The Encore fit us perfectly  Our room was fantastic  on the   nd floor  out of      and was tastefully furnished  The bed and bedding lived up to the reputaion Stayed in for   nights to watch the NBA playoffs as our team was playing  so ordered room service on both occations  The response time was extremely quick  which I don t usually find  The servers were the best and gave you a total   star dining experience Everybody on the staff that we encountered were extremely pleasant and friendly I will agree with many that the check in process was outlandishly long  Took us about    minutes to even get to someone  And though I ve run across this before  when the front desk person said  quot let s see if we have anything for you quot  I wanted to scream  I m glad that was my first impression as opposed to the final impression  
N =>  Encore not worth a     star rating I read a lot about the Encore on this site and other places to make sure I would be getting my money s worth by staying at a highly rated hotel  Some of the negative things I read I assumed were freaky or isolated incidents and would not happen to me    like we all tend to think  Well  I learned my lesson We made our reservation over   months ago and specifically requested a panoramic view of the strip  They were happy to take my      deposit and make   months of interest on it before we showed up only to discover they did not give us the room we requested  So I called the front desk as soon as we walked into the room and told them that we did not have a room with a strip view as we originally requested  I was politely told that they can not guarantee the type of view one would request however I was told at the time of the reservation  made directly to the hotel  that a strip view was certain  only the specific floor height could not be guaranteed  The Front Desk then told me that they would put us in the different room with a strip view later that day and would call us when it was available  So we sat with our bags unpacked for   hours waiting  No call  I decided to go down to the Front Desk and see what the status was with this change  They had no record of my room change request and then they said there were no strip view rooms available  Not a single one  no sir    not a single one  I then asked to speak with the manager  The lady at the front desk was very polite and left her computer to seek out the manager in the back room  The manager never showed   which I thought rude   I waited quite a while and when she returned she magically had a room with the view we requested  Even though she insisted there was not a single room available with a panoramic strip view   No apology  no explaination  not even a slight embarrasment at the inconsistencies of how they approached my disppointment   quot They must have Magic Rooms quot   I told my partner that appear out of nowhere when you use the magic word  quot manager quot   You may want to remember this if you find yourself in a similar situation should you chose the Encore I joined Trip Advisor just to write this review about the Encore  I normally let things slide but in this case I expected more from this place  So the Check In Service really sucks  I know other people have written about this same problem at the Encore on this site    you may want to see what they have to tell you about their particular details About details  just a few things   Expect to walk alot if you want to get to the center of the strip where the action is  There is no convenient access to the monorail if you re considering that  There use to be a shuttle from the Encore that took you to the Convention Center where you could catch the monorail  That s no longer provided  It s either a taxi or hoofing it  If you walk expect    minutes from the Encore to the center of the stip  where the Paris or Ceasars Palace is located   We definitely got our excercise during our   days there The food is good at the Encore and the service at these restaurant was quite good    its only the service at the Check In Front Desk that is very poor  The bar in our room was missing items and had not been restocked Also we got zero bed turn down service at night  Which I thought was a common thing with   or   star  rated hotels  be not in Vegas considering what some people go to Vegas for If your still debating about staying maybe at the Wynn or Encore  I would go for the Wynn  Even though Steve Wynn ownes both and they are connected physically  the Wynn offeres more in terms of view options if you want a view of the strip  The Wynn offers a nicer floor layout of the casino and shops  restaurants and I think a way better pool  It offers more shade area around the pool in the mid afternoon than the Encore which in the summer you may definitely want The rooms themselves are very nice and tailored in modern lines  Great bed Four hours after we checked in we finally settled in the room we were expecting  
N =>  I can see why Steve Wynn did not put his name on the second one  I have stayed at the Wynn several times and have always been delighted  I can not say the same thing for Encore  When we arrived  about  pm  on a Friday night we were told that there were only smoking rooms available and that Encore does not guarantee a  quot smoking preference quot  and that a non smoking room is just a request  This was extremely dissappointing to me since this is something that most hotels can seam to manage and did not think that it should be beyond the capability of Encore to be able to manage their own inventory  When we got to the room it did not have a smoky smell  but throughout the weekend as people smoked it got almost unbareable In the morning I went to the coffee bar just outside the room elevators and although it did not seam any busier than a typical starbucks  I found it diffcult to order a simple cup of coffee  There did not seam to be any kind of line and the employees seamed harried  unorganized and not very friendly  After several people that arrived after me were waited on  I got someones attention and was able to order my coffee  When I went to add cream and sugar there was no cream in the picture  I handed it to the person that was makeing the the specialty coffee drinks and she handed it back to me and told there was someone that was assigned to keep an eye on that  After    minutes a person did come by to fill the cream     she handed the empty picher to the same person I had    minutes before and filled it and handed it back to her coworker That evening we went to a show at another proerty and got back to our room just before      pm and ordered room service just after   pm and was told the meal would be at our room by midnight   A little outside the norm for a hotel  but apreciated them letting us know that it would take a little bit of extra time   We did not receive our meal at midnight    we did not receive it until        We got a call a few minutes before it was delivered asking us if we still wanted it   Not to apologize that it was so late   When the food arrived  it was obvious that the meal had sat in the window awaiting delivery as the bread was hard  the meat had that dried out look and the fries were soggy In the morning I again went to the coffe shop  it was still fairly unorganized  but I was a little more agressive with my place in line and got the attention of an employee to take my order  I added a couple of breakfast sandwhiches to the order and was told someone would bring it from the back  I paid for the sandwhiches and waited anout    minutes for them to be brought out  I was sitting on the other side of the coffee bar when the person delivered the sandwhich as when I went to inquire about my sandwhiches they were sitting in a bag on a wet tray behind the bar  I was handed the sandwhiches and was told they had been waiting there for me and that I was waiting on the wrong side   quot wow quot  I guess it was my fault  They did not apologize or offer to give me a  nd bag  the material was soaked through  So I took the sandwhiches out of the bag  I was afraid that the bag would break  and piled my sandwhiches on top of my cups of coffe and juggled my pruchases all the way to the room Finally although well stocked the gift shop sundry shop just before the rooms elevator is riddicously overpriced  
N =>  Upsell Scam   Be Fore warned Seems anyone trying to check in before       is told they will have to wait    unless you would like to  quot upgrade quot   for        night We didn t want to and protested  so they told us we could try checking back in after       They know most people want to get to their rooms  so most people  suckers like us  will pay the charge Over the course of our stay  we talked with other guests who experienced the same scam  Paying anywhere from           extra per night  Friggin Joke Room was no upgrade  Nothing special  just extra     for the priviledge of checking in before      Hotel is nice  but pretentious   not friendly Wish it was easier to get a cup of coffee in the AM No casual restaurants or sandwich shops  
N =>  FABULOUS    The BEST customer service  I have ever experienced    We were treated like royalty  The rooms were very clean  The pool and casino was very nice  We can t wait to go back and will definitely recommend this place to all of our friends and family  Superior    
N =>  THE ENCORE AT WYNN   PERFECTION AS USUAL My husband and I have been vacationing in Las Vegas for     years now  and we have yet to find any properties that rival in any way those of Steve Wynn s two signature hotels on the strip  WYNN  amp  ENCORE  As ENCORE is a relatively new hotel to Las Vegas  I believe it premiered in ember        We usually stay at WYNN  but were curious to see if Mr  Wynn could top his first effort  We were pleased  but not surprised to find the same flawless service had carried over from Wynn to Encore  The same opulent  luxurious surroundings  but with different color schemes in both the public areas and the rooms  I was slightly concerned about Encore  as a very SLIGHT minority of reviews here were anything but complimentary  But  as usual  I was not disappointed in the quality of both the hotel and it s employees  Check in was a breeze  as was our request to be upraded to a panoramic view rooom  Our rooms are always comped  which just reinforces the old saying  quot the best things in life are free  quot   The cabana was perfect  the meal at SWITCH outstanding  the room was cozily sophisticated and elegant and the view was beautiful  Everywhere we went  Encore employees went out of their way to be gracious and helpful  There was absolutely NO NOISE FROM THE CLUB BELOW  as previously reported  And   although there were cigarette burns on some of the suite  this is in no way the Resort s fault  What kind of an idiot smokes in a NON SMOKING ROOM and leaves cig burns all over the place    I would hate to see what their home looks like  These are the same people that are never pleased with anything I don t know what some of the other writers here are talking about  We have NEVER had anything but a PERFECT time at WYNN ENCORE  But  when we travel  we don t make outlandish requests and then smirk and report gleefully when our requests aren t met  We treat and tip others as we would wish to be treated and or tipped  And yes  that means     for restaurant service and as warranted for all other services  We will be back at WYNN ENCORE for our usual two three more vacations this year  Why would we go anywhere else   when we have found PERFECTIONS  AS USUAL   
N =>  Beautiful Hotel   great service We just returned from the Encore celebrating our anniversary  Everyone was extremely courteous from the front desk staff to the valet and bell hop  Upon checking in  we did not encounter a long line at all  maybe had to wait     minutes  They were aware that it was our anniversary and mentioned it more than once  We asked for a room with a nice room and were able to check in immediately with a beautiful room  We had a     resort credit which I will say did not go far   mixed drinks are       beer is         It s possible a lot of the bad reviews are upon the hotel first opening  My only complaint would be the price of things  The hotel was incredible  
N =>   Not up to Par A quick two night visit to the Encore over the Memorial Day weekend had some positives  amp  negatives  Checking in on the Sunday of the weekend around  pm  I was greeted with dizzying lines at check in  amp  despite a confirmed  pre paid reservation  no rooms were available for immediate check in  Some people in line were absolutely brutal to the staff  but this was a   star    diamond hotel that was telling people like myself that we d have to leave our bags with the valet  amp  come back in a couple of hours when there was availabillity  Not being a huge gambler  I went to the pool  The European pool was just what I needed  Cold cocktails  fun music  lots of Memorial weekend party ers drinking  NBA playoffs on TVs  high limit poolside gambling  photo posing    many lovely ladies topless  A delightful diversion from reality  A couple hours later  a room was available  Unfortunately  it was a king bed room  not the two double beds that my reservation had requested  A roll out bed was delivered    with the same top quality linens the room beds are fitted with  No issues with my stay until check out  The automated system for in room check outs was down causing extra long lines  amp  delays in the reception area  Once again  I heard some truly rude  amp  nasty tirades from my fellow guests over their Encore experience  I do not envy their customer service staff I was somewhat surprised that there were no  quot comps quot  made for my inconveniece at the commencement of my trip    but I guess even Steve Wynn is feeling the recession  In closing  the Encore is a beautiful property  The rooms are beyond comfortable  The Encore experience can be quite sinful if you hang out at the pool or at their XS nightclub  All that said  I don t believe this is worthy of   stars diamonds  In the future  I might visit the Encore again but if I had the option of the theHotel at the Mandalay  the Palazzo or Bellagio  I d choose them first  
N =>   Beautiful hotel but disappointing customer service The hotel itself was amazing and definitely five star however the customer service was not  We arrived two hours before check in and we re told we could only check in early if we would pay an additional    US per night  We did not agree to this and we re then asked to continue phoning the hotel to check on the rooms progress as they didn t have time to call all guests to advise on room availablity  This information was provided by both check in staff and by a front desk manager  The hotel had very limited mobile network service and the manager acknowlegde this and said I would need to use a pay phone to check on the room  No efffort was made to make our initial Encore experience special The hotels position is the last major hotel on the strip at present and was a little far out form all the action  
N =>   Lifestyles Rich  We got a free   night stay at Encore via one of my wife s department store accounts   so we went to Vegas  We got good airfares from San Diego  went USAir going and Southwest returning  Did   ways to get best fares times  Used BellTrans Shuttle to get to from aikrport hotel      total  At check in we were offered upsell from resort suite to panoramic suite for     night   and we did  The view from the   th floor was spectacular  The room was very  very nice  By the bed was a control box for lights  do not disturb   and the window drapes  There was a mini bar and snacks for purchase  The triple digit highs broke the day before we arrived  thank goodness  However  we still limited our pool stays to        AM  Beautiful order takers came around frequently We spent some time at the penny slots  the casino  and Vegas  appeared to be only a little over    percent  but might have been higher  The Encore staff were plentiful  helpful  and very nice Lastly  Encore is very nice but  tres cher  quot  
N =>   All hype   will never go back I spent a weekend at the Encore for a bachelorette party in        After reading the reviews and seeing photos of the suites online  it seemed like a great option  The  quot all suites quot  hotel was dissappointing from start to finish  The rooms had a sitting area  but it was very small and cramped  The hotel decor itself was nice  but the customer service was horrible  We also dined at the restaurant switch  which also had rave reviews  but was nothing better than a below average steakhouse  From check in to check out  the staff was rude and unaccomidating  We requested a late check out since some of us were not flying out until the afternoon  and they were not able to accomidate that on a sunday  And to top it off  we were charged     for OPENING the minibar  not for USING the minibar  The minibar is on sensors  as are the snacks on the dresser  so even if you open it to see what is inside  they charge you  After we checked out  my friend and I sat in the hotel lounge to rest after walking around  and we were rudely approached by the server who said there was a   drink minimum per person just to sit in the lounge  which  by the way at   pm was EMPTY   Overall a terrible experience   with so many great hotel choices in Vegas  save your    and stay somewhere where they appreciate your business  
N =>  Terrible hotel Terrible Service I stayed at the Encore from for four days last week and I must admit I was extremely disappointed  I choose the Encore because I had a great time at the Wynn last year  I assumed that the Encore would live up to its brother hotel  if not be better  and trust me it is not My party consisted of   adults and   rooms total  The problems started right away  I requested a two bedroom room over four months ago when I booked the vacation  only to come to the surprise that there were not only no   bedrooms available  but there were not going to be for my whole stay  If I booked this trip a few weeks ago I would understand  however  I feel over four months in advance I should be guaranteed what I wanted  The man at the front desk explained that saying what kind of room you wanted was just a request and was not guaranteed  Once I got into my room there was no hot water  you would think this would be a temporary problem but it lasted the entire length of my stay    days   and that was in all   rooms we rented  Management could care less that a whole floor was not getting hot water for an entire week  They were well aware of the problem  from my understanding a pipe broke on the floor I was on  The icing on the cake was in no way did management even attempt to compensate for this extremely unpleasant surprise with the water  Onto dinner  I ate at a few of the restaurants during my stay  every time I had to wait over    minutes later than my reservation time  Once again  all we received from this was apologies  In one instance we missed the beginning of Le Reve which we had tickets for that same night because of the consistent tardiness  Onto the pool  The pool is tiny and cramped compared to the Wynn  For the entire four days we tried to reserve a cabana  and was not able to do so once  In fact  one day the head cabana boy said we weren t even on the list to get one when I spoke to that cabana boy just the day before and saw him put my name down  I understand I am not Trump or Rockefella but I thought they would treat any customer a little better especially during a recession  The service was terrible  the rooms were very nice but not being able to get hot water for the entire stay was terrible  Not receiving the room I requested over four months ago is just foolish  This is supposedly a five star resort I would say it is a   tops  The best part about it was did they even compensate me for anything  even offer a dinner on the  only in my dreams  I play   hour on a table at the Venetian I can go stay there compt any week I want to during the year  I play over    hours in a week at the Encore I get a buffett compt for one person  Steve Wynn you should really be ashamed on how you are screwing the American Public with this new    Star  resort  I will never go back  
N =>   Great except for     Just returned home from a   night stay at Encore  The hotel is fantastic and the rooms are wonderful  The only issue we had was a lack of hot water for showers  We called and reported the problem and a maintenance guy came up  He told us that we d just have to let the water run longer to warm up  The only way it ever warmed up was to run the hot bath water the entire time the shower was running  a huge waste of water   When we checked out we mentioned it again and got a simple  quot I m sorry about that quot   I expected a much higher level of service and customer satisfaction from this otherwise incredible hotel  Cold showers aren t fun  therefore I would not recommend Encore  
N =>   Worst Place To Plan A Special Event I wanted to plan a trip for my Boyfriend and his Twin Brother for their   th Birthday  We are originally for Orange County  CA so it was going to be quiet an expensive trip to gather a group our closest friends to travel out to Vegas with us  Having monthly comps at the Palazzo we decided to go outside the box and try a hotel stay at Encore at the Wynn  We were extremely excited after viewing how elegant and nice the hotel is on their website  We decided to plan the entire stay at the Wynn  Club Tryst on Friday night and Club XS on Saturday night  This is so we would never have to leave the hotel  I had arranged the whole weekend the week in advance to ensure that everything was set in stone with our stay at the Encore At check in  the lobby area felt extremely clutter due to the fact that they do no host an employee to direct any one person to a check in station  Upon check in  each guest is supposed to wait in any given line we unfortunately stood in a line with a guest who took    minuets to check out  When my party got to the front I told the check in host that I wanted to check in for   rooms on my reservation but leave the key cards up front so when my friends came they could pick up their room keys without checking in  The host had me write down each person s name myself so she can have a key card ready  I had originally booked my stay at the Wynn s website so I was surprise to know that my reservation rate was changed upon check in  I had to wait around    to    minuets for the host to fully check me in since she had to rebook my stay and get manager approval at the rate I booked on Wynn s Website  This was very annoying  You walk into this hotel come to find out that you are already starting to have problems All   rooms were booked on the same floor  Unfortunately my room was booked next to a room that had a barking door  THAT NEVER STOPPED BARKING  I don t even believe dogs are allowed in the hotel  I am not certain  The room is small compared to The Palazzo  Nothing too special about the room except that it is modern and updated  The restrooms have no vents so when taking a hot shower it steams up the whole room  There is only one TV for the room and one for the bathroom  Which in other hotels I receive   flat screens and   in the bathrooms  So that night we went to Tryst  We were placed at a outside deck table  when we specifically asked to be inside  The table host stated that unless we tipped him or bought   additional bottles we would not be able to be sat inside  Due to the fact that we were going to have bottle service at XS the next night we wanted to keep simple for the first night so we decided not to tip the table host         and keep our table  To be so blunt about a bribe I was very shocked  I received a call around      pm while at Tryst from a friend that was staying in one of the   rooms  He stated that he was unable to check in and I would have to leave Tryst to check in for him  I couldn t believe that the original check in host did not do her job  but now I was being asked to leave the Tryst night club so I could check my party in  I asked my friend to hand over the phone but the check in host stated that I would have to come to the front or call in  I called in and my friend was able to check in  Come to find out when he checked in  the host upstairs gave my friend the key to my hotel room  not theirs  How would you feel as a guest barely checking in to your hotel room to find that the room was being used by someone else  The immediately got on the phone with guest services stating the room was already used and to bring a key to their suite immediately  It took them    minuets  WHAT HORRIBLE CHECK IN STAFF THE HAVE The next night we went to XS at  pm to get our table  The table host blew us off and made us wait in line foe   hours  Then around       they stated that all the tables were given away and that all they could do was free entry  WTF right  We had a table reservation  we waited in line and they treated us like crap  I was furious by that time The next night I check out of the Encore totally sadden by the customer service  I called into the hotel asking for a credit with Hotel Correspondence  They stated that I would hear back within   to   business days  I did not hear back in   Business days so I called back again  They still did not have an answer  Then I called back a  rd time and still no results All in all the service at the Wynn  Encore  Tryst  and XS are horrible  I will never stay their again due to the help that they hire to run there table service and check in  I cant believe my boyrfirends trip was ruined due to Table Host who would not treat a hotel guest GOOD unless they were tipped under the table  
N =>   Beautiful Hotel Just came back from a weekend at Encore  Got a great package deal through Allegiant Air  which made this hotel a great value  We didn t ask for an upgrade  but were given a room on the   th floor with a great view of part of the golf course  the Wynn and a bit of the strip  The room was gorgeous and super large    beds  a huge L shaped couch  luxurious bathroom  Very comfy beds The only hotel amenity we used went to was the nightclub XS  Hottest club in Vegas and it was amazing  Lineup on Saturday was insane  we were very lucky to find someone who helped us get in right away  For eating and swimming we always went to the Wynn  which has a better selection of restaurants and a bigger pool It s true what ppl say about the noise  The walls in the room are a little thin  we could hear the couple next door arguing   mind you  they were talking really loud  Also  even on the   th floor we could hear a faint thud from the bass of the club music  Didn t bother us as we had just come from there and at  am there was nothing that could stop us from falling sleeping  The only real downside to this hotel is the location  We mostly used Wynn amenities and anytime we left Encore to go somewhere else  like the mall  we had to go through the Wynn  Basically  even though Encore was great  I wouldn t stay there again   the Wynn is just as amazing  so out of convenience  I would stay there instead next time  
N =>   Great hotel spoilt by the noise and service  We have stayed in three different hotels in Vegas and enjoyed our stay each time  The Venetian  The Wynn  LV Hilton   But unfortunately our stay at The Encore was not great There is no doubt the decor and presentation of the resort is excellent  We stayed on the   th floor with a Strip view  The room was very clean and well presented although the decor was not to our taste The room overlooked the pool and XS nightclub   that s where the problems started  XS is open from      pm to     am  The bass and drumming from the nightclub music carried in to our room rendering a quiet nights sleep impossible  After our complaints  we were relocated to an upgraded room on the   th floor with Strip view  Still had to use ear plugs though as the nightclub was still audible We also had mixed and confusing service associated with the Red Card  this is the card you can accumulate gaming points for comps   We were told on receipt of the card that we would receive a complimentary buffet after     points   not honoured by the hotel  Then told that we would receive other comps after     points   also not honoured  Finally  we were told that we could get cash back at check out  but guess what  not honoured All in all  whilst a great looking resort  perhaps it needs to decide whether it wants to become a resort centred around nightlife  or luxury relaxation  A little more transparancy on the Red Card would also be welcome  
N =>  Lovely Hotel But Would Not Pay Full Price Stayed at Encore           It is a lovely hotel decorated in red and butterflies  The casino is small but not so much that it seemed crowded  I would describe it as intimate  The first room we were in was on the   th floor facing the south strip  It was a lovely view of the strip  pools and Wynn golf course  Unfortunately  we were bothered by the music from the nightclub and had to move  They moved us down and across the hall   No nightclub noise on that side  Housekeeping was not as through as I would expect at a   star property  The bath counter did not seem to get wiped down during the entire stay  A dirty wine glass from Tuesday was still there when we left Friday  There was a blue M amp M and three Encore ink pens wedged between the wall and the nightstand  They are probably still there  We paid      night for our stay  I would not pay more than that to stay at this property  
N =>  Great Service We stayed in the tower suites  We tried to upgrade to a larger suite but the only room available was the salon suite for an extra      night  Not going to happen  The service was wonderful  the room was comfortable  and the bed was outstanding  My only complaint was the pool area is small and I really detested the music that was being blasted around the pool area  It sounded like high end elevator music  I have bose noise reducing headsets and I could still hear it over my music  We rented a cabana the last day there  It is expensive at      day but was so worth it  Overall  we definitely would stay here again  
N =>  Good hotel with a few issues We stayed   Encore         We are a couple in our upper    s who have been to Vegas many times  previously staying   Caesars  Got a great deal thru FATWALLET using code VIPCODE which was      for weekends  amp       for weekdays so we decided to switch  I felt that check in was disorganized in that you lined up behind a clerk vs a snakeline in which you got looked after in order of showing up  We had reserved   beds  They told us that they only had rooms with a King bed available  that they were sold out so we either took it or not  They offered us a rollaway bed   no thanks  Then when I was asked to sign the registration card  I noticed that they wanted to charge us      for Sat night  I said no way  amp  clerk had to go check with the Supervisor in order to give us the      rate that I had booked  Got assigned a resort room on the  th floor in the middle of the floor ie close to the elevators  View was overlooking the pool nightclub etc  amp  SW view  Had no noise issues whatsoever re the Club or neighbours  Elevators are conviently located behind Registration  Lobby Bar opens        AM for quick breakfasts  amp  great cappucino  We were out of the room        AM Saturday  amp  when we returned after       room had not been made up  Called  amp  complained  amp  were told that they had until      to clean the rooms  Fine   we tracked down a maid  amp  got fresh towels  amp  told them no service required for that day  Next two days  we were also out of the room early  amp  both days  room was cleaned by noon  No turn down service unless requested Ate   Botero  Wazuzu  amp  Society Cafe  amp  all were good  Ate   Okada  WIng Lei  Buffet  amp  Terrace Court   Wynn  amp  they were very good with Wing Lei outstanding IMHO  Pools  ie    are small with virutally no shade  When we went out there Friday        PM  no chaises available  Next   days we were there early  amp  had no problems getting a chaise which was very comfortable  Most people   pool  amp  the hotel in general seemed under    ie crowd seemed much younger than Caesars Casino is smallish  amp  Cashier has only   wickets  Re Red Card  When you sign up  you get     in free slot play  For every    played  you get   point  After     points  you get a spin at a wheel with min win of     in free slot play  After     points  free buffet for     Wynn since Encore has no buffet  Cash back is for every    points you get    back so you need to gamble      to get    back  Warning   do NOT get your cashback until you hit     points since points reset to zero as soon as you take your cashback Fashion Mall is across the Street  Area North of Encore seemed very dead  All action is south of Encore Wynn  Checkout was efficient  amp  there were no issues with our bill  
N =>  Great Suite but hated the red buttterfly carpets We stayed at Encore for   nights  The room was relaxing with nice sectional couch  swivel TV and the bathroom was great  however the handle from the shower fell off  there was no soap holder and the soap would always slip from the ledge on to the floor  Also when you opened the bathroom door it almost hit the toilet seat  Those were my issues    my husband said the desk phone wasn t working and he had to put a towel under the door to keep the sound of our neighbour s phone conversation from coming in  He also felt he was getting charged too much for incidentals  We did get a good deal on the room and a     credit which you could use in the Hotel We went to the Japanese restaurant Okada at Wynn the sushi was good but way overpriced and the     credit gets eaten up in   seconds I would recommend the Terrance Pointe Cafe  the Asian salad was outstanding  We went to another place for breakfast can t remember the name but was terrible the breakfast bagel was hard and the egg inside had been cooked the day before I m sure and the coffee wasn t good and they wanted     I would recommend going to Starbucks in the mall across the street We also used the liquor store close by to get some good bottles of red wine to take back and enjoy in our room We enjoyed both pools  however the music was a bit loud at the topless pool only saw   person topless  but I guess you can t please everyone all the time We had a fun time anyway We were supposed to go to Mexico but changed our plans coz of the swine flu  Forgot to mention I thought the red butterfly carpets throughout the Hotel were tacky but then again that s Vegas for you  
N =>  One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in We stayed at the Wynn Encore during our recent stay in Las Vegas  It was our first visit to Vegas and we also stayed at the MGM during our trip  The Encore was a very luxurious  We paid     for our room on     hotels com and when checking in were offered an upgrade to a      ft room for      or to pay     to have a view of the strip  We declined both of these and our room was on the   th floor facing up the strip towards the stratosphere  The view was amazing especially at night  The casino it self was quieter than the others we had visited on the strip  but it had a lovely relaxed atmosphere  The room was huge   don t know why we would have needed an upgrade   and the bathroom was lovely especially the TV you could watch while in the bath  The pool looked lovely although we did not use it during our stay  Would definately recommend the Encore especially as you can get some cheap rooms at the moment  
N =>  Superb The room was wonderful  the service was excellent   I d stay here again in a heartbeat  Really  really nice place  
N =>  Luxurious   star with a few service challenges A gorgeous  elegantly appointed luxurious hotel  The rooms are beautiful  beds super comfortable  the food is spectacular  It is located at the far end of the strip   the last hotel before a bunch of empty lots and construction but it s a quick walk to Palazzo  Forum Shops and Fashion Show etc  The casino floor is laid out very elegantly and is much brighter than most  it s a refreshing change  Unfortunately  I did experience some problems with service  On arrival  the front desk attendant sold me a room upgrade based on a  quot guaranteed panoramic view of the strip quot    I bought the upgrade because it was my boyfriends first visit to Las Vegas and we discussed how nice it would be to have such a view  When I got to my room  I found myself on the back side of the hotel with a view of the empty lots and construction site  It was  quot arguably quot  still the strip   but there was no mistake  I had been sold an upgrade to the back side of the hotel and the view was not what I was sold  I made my way back to the front desk and explained that I felt very deceived  The woman apologized  but did not offer to remove the upgrade charge  I was baffled at why a hotel of this caliber would do something so cheap  I decided to wait until check out to see if they would correct the problem   upon check out the upgrade charge was still there  I think it s sad because this hotel incredible  yet I ll always remember it as the hotel that deceived me into paying for a view that I didn t get  On our arrival   we had flown from the E  Coast and were starving   we went to the buffet  I would normally not consider the buffet but we didn t know our way around the hotel and this was the first thing we got to  I was AMAZED at how good the food was  I ve never seen a buffet quite like this one  Unfortunately  we waited    minutes for the server to come over to our table to take our drink order and after finishing  the server never came back to give us the bill for the drinks  I had to get up and search for a hostess who disappeared to go looking for our server  Leaving us standing around waiting so that we could pay    for a beer   ridiculous  It was not a good start to this stay and I think that having the   problems points to some deficiencies in service management  It s not horrible  but just not up to the standard you would expect Despite the   unfortunate service incidents  I still think this hotel is amazing   I recommend it highly and I will definitely be staying here again   but I ll pass on the upgrade next time  and I ve learned my lesson about buffets  
N =>  Truly classy very upscale  We got a great deal booking flight  amp  hotel package with Westjet back in ruary We arrived at Check in around      pm and asked for a non smoking room as we requested initially however we did not get into our room until     pm  Booked the Resort Suite and were offered an upgrade to one of the top    floors for     per day  This was a special promotion as they normally charge      per day so we took it  It was worth it  Be prepared to bring your bathing suit to lounge by the pool while you wait for your room The hotel was incredibly beautiful  amp  oppulent to say the least  Upscale in every way  We ve stayed at Caesars Palace  amp  MGM in the past and enjoyed the latter as it was midway through the strip in the midst of the hustle  amp  bustle  We love to be in the heart of the main strip as it gave us a plethora of choices for entertainment  dining  amp  nightlife  This resort was quite far from everything else  Took advantage of the Monorail passes however we were told that Wynn had cancelled the stop at their hotel so we had to walk all the way to Harrah s station to catch the train everyday Rooms Resort Suite was beautiful with separate bedroom  amp  living room divided by a half wall with swivel HD television  We requested the strip view but got the mountain view instead  King size bed was the most comfortable we ve ever slept on  Sound proof rooms as we could not hear a peep from the surrounding rooms or the hallways  Very nice  Bathrobes  safe  good amenities Dining We ate at Stratta s on our last night there and it was quite disappointing  After being seated we waited    minutes before we were even greeted and handed our menu s  Our server was too busy to take our table as she was overwhelmed by   tables already  We had another server from a farther section come over to take our order and he seemed to be in a hurry all the time  Food was phenominal but unfortunately I can t say the same for the service  I don t blame the wait staff but the management who run this restaurant  Maggiano s Little Italy located at the Fashion Show Mall  Food  amp  service were great and you definitely get your money s worth here  Servings are absolutely generous  Our waiter Shane took his time and was genuine when it came down to suggested dishes  etc  We highly recommend this place if you decide to stay at this end of the strip Nightlife We ventured over to BLUSH on Wednesday evening  Nice ambiance but once again  service was not that great  Unless you re planning on purchasing  quot Bottle Service quot  your waitress will not even bat an eye  We ordered high end Cognac but noticed only   tables had bottle service  They were taken care of very well while the remainder of the guests in the bar resorted to getting their drinks from the bartender  Pool Wonderful but be prepared to spend quite a bit for drinks  amp  food  Enjoyed it just the same  Service was great the first day however second day waitress didn t even once come by our section as there were    other guests complaining  No big deal as we just grabbed our drinks at the pool bar  We did look into booking a private Cabana but at      per day      per half day  we decided to pass  Lounge Bars We enjoyed all the lounge bars in the hotel but one of our favourites was the bar located just outside the Eastside Lounge  Service was great and Joe our bartender was super friendly and very generous with the drinks     Nice to see they don t believe in watering down their beverages We were prepared for the upscale ambiance  amp        however as mentioned before the location is too far from everything  Overall we did enjoy our vacation and we do not regret reserving our stay here  Whether it s a   star or   star  you will always find good and bad  
N =>  Nothing short of Fantastic  Upon check in we realized my wallet was missing  We were not sure where it had lost  We told the staff and they quickly had security checking to see which cab we had arrived in  They were genuinely concerned and very helpful  We were impressed with this The old adage  quot  you get what you pay for quot  is true  at least for us  with our stay at Encore  We had the pleasure of having great service from the Bell Desk  Valet  Security  Registration and Concierge Our room was spotless and I checked it over quite well after reading some reviews on here  We had absolutely no problems with our room or service  The rooms are gorgeous  a little disappointing that they did not have jet tubs however I loved all the natural light in the Casino and a huge plus  the Casino was not smokey like all the other Casinos  The restaurants are on the pricier side  so if you are not into that  you can find more affordable places to eat while sightseeing All in all we had a great stay at Encore and would go back in a heartbeat A heads up about the cab drivers however  We found a lot would take the longer way than they had to    this ran up the meter immensely  Be warned  
N =>   Finest Hotel on The Strip but be ready to pay  THE ROOM  Visited the Encore   days in late il       Was upgraded to a Panoramic View Suite on the   st floor  Great room    ft tall windows  electronic sheers   curtains and lighting  Big screen HD TV  Good size closet  arate shower and tub  Dual sink vanity   nd TV in bathroom  Robes  scale  hair dryer and ample custom toiletries  Mini Bar  Internet was approximately     a day but incredibly fast  As I remember it was about   meg up AND down FOOD  Dined at Wazuzu in the Encore  Very Asian  Very good but expensive  Also ate at Strata in the Wynn  neighboring sister hotel   NOT GOOD  This was my second attempt at Strata  This trip was late night dining  In ember it was for dinner before the La Reve show  That experience was not good and both our waitress and the assistant manager thought it appropriate to debate with a guest  I m sure this behavior is not taught or tolerated by Steve Wynn  Management should clean house at Strata and start over at this particular restaurant Did The Buffet  Wynn  for lunch  It was all very good but given the price I felt the offerings were a bit on the meager side  Could be a reflection of the economy as The Buffet was not at all busy this trip  Tried the Sunday Brunch at The Buffet on my ember      trip and it was excellent  Also have had several very good meals at the Terrace Point Cafe  Wynn   It s the required hotel  quot coffee shop quot  but a very upscale one  We perused the other restaurants at both The Encore and Wynn  Most of the restaurants at both hotels are business casual attire or better in the evening  Room service was prompt and service there was good CASINO  The casino at The Encore is a bit smaller than at The Wynn but very nice  Cocktail service in the gaming area was excellent POOL  Didn t partake personally this trip but it looked excellent ENTERTAINMENT  Took in the La Reve show last ember  Hard to describe but it s a sort of Cirque Du Soleil type water show  It was excellent and I definitely recommend it SPA  Had a massage in the spa  Fantastic  Excellent facility  Juice bar was a nice surprise  Expensive BUSINESS CENTER  Went to the business center at The Encore to print a boarding pass  Told the staff what I wanted to do and they directed me to a computer they appeared to have set aside for this  No charge  Very nice touch  As an aside I was very glad I took care of this ahead of time as the airport ticketing area was a mess on my departure and even the self service kiosks were mobbed MISC  I m not sure why but it seemed like taxi cabs were a little hard to come by at The Encore during my stay  Everyone seemed to agree that this was the case but no one was sure why CONCLUSION  Loved The Encore and overall it was a real treat  Will definitely stay there or at The Wynn again  Be ready to pay though because NOTHING at either of these hotels is inexpensive  
N =>   Nice but I would return only if I got a good rate I just returned from a three night stay at the Encore  The rooms are spacious  clean  beautifully decorated and comfortable  The location on the strip isn t bad  but just be prepared for LOTS and LOTS of walking  Comfortable shoes are a must  The staff was relatively friendly  A few complaints which didn t surprise me based on some reviews  our room was not ready until about     pm  we arrived at  pm just in time for check in   We had to ask at least     times before we could check in  There is really no place to sit and hang out   and who wants to drag their luggage all around  The walls are paper thin and even though we stayed on the   th floor  the music each night  until  am  from the club downstairs was LOUD with constant BASS  No need to go to the club  we could have had the club right in our room  I requested a one hour late checkout  and was told that wasn t possible  After some negotiation  our request was finally granted   after all  we had to wait to check in  the least they could do was let us stay an hour longer  The hotel feels like a maze and it takes a good while to walk through the smokey casino and shops  One tip   the hotel  store  is pricey but there is a discount store in the Fashion Show Mall directly across the street  I suggest going there to stock up on water  I would stay at the Encore again  but only if we got a good rate  otherwise  I might check out another property  
N =>   Great Addition to the Strip Stayed here on a promotion  Great hotel  Service very friendly  Ate at Sinatra  Good meal but the Italian wine was way overpriced  Room was fantastic with greeat view  Heated tiles in bathroom made it difficult to adjust all room temperatures  We didn t leave the room the first day until noon  and despite the maid seeing us leave  and turning on the sign for room cleaning  was not cleaned when we returned at      pm  
N =>   sevice needs improvement room is ok but not as family friendly as i hoped    way overrated when we confirmed our reservation a week in advance  we requested two queen beds  after check in we had to walk all the way around a lounge  would have been convenient to just walk from registration straight to the elevators   when we checked in they gave us a room with an awesome view of the strip  however there was no extra bed  the bathroom lights were burnt and the black sofa has not been cleaned because we could see a lot of dandruff and hair and crumbs    they accommodated us with another room closer to floor level with no view  but a just a bit cleaner as far as the black sofa goes    but our complementary robes and slippers were missing unlike the previous room  eventually a few calls were made and they provided us with a small roll away bed  for the night  our   year old went wild in the soaking tub and we had to use the towels to dry the floor  we requested housekeeping to give us more towels and clean up the wet mess    there were wet towels everywhere    we left the room for dinner and when we came back there was   tall stacks of towels  but the old towels were still in a wet pile   housekeeper probably just stepped over the mess and dropped off the towels and left  we also had to request a little refrigerator just to make it easier for baby formula and leftover food drinks    room didn t have tiny kitchen or jacuzzi  just a small soaking tub  all in all it was a so so experience not bad or good    oh yeah  WIFI  internet was not free  local calls not free   no complimentary tooth brush paste  the power outlets on the work desk doesn t work  bummer    last year we stayed at the MGM Signature and was totally blown away  it was just the opposite  ie free wifi  big jacuzzi with jets  little kitchen and frig     that s probably why we have high expectations this time around     bottom line  overrated  better value available else where  housekeeping needs to be more on top of things  resort suite probably not meant to be family friendly due to lack of little conveniences    the vibe of encore wynn is a little family unfriendly  like checking in your stroller because they rather have you and children without stroller      good for young couples on the go not for young family with   young kids  
N =>   Golden Nugget not so golden rooms Went to Golden Nugget for Las Vegas Bike Week       Arrived and room looked very nice  Till the evening I killed the cock roach and his partner exscaped under the door to the adjacent room  Reported issue to Manager on duty Jerry and he asked if I charged anything to the room but we were paying cash and not charging  He said the exterminating crew was there and he would have room sprayed  Never heard anything more about issue  Then we noticed the mold in the shower  And the final event was the person attempting to enter our room  Hotel person shows up and knocks on door and discovers that they gave the person the wrong room number  When we checked out we asked for some sort of comp for these issues  Manager on duty ignored my wife and said that Jerry would look into it Bike Fest was interesting but I would consider other hotel options  
N =>  very long check in lines My first impression of the Golden Nugget was not good  When I arrived  there was a very long line to check in  I stood in line for over an hour  During my three day stay  there was always a long line  It was tiresome after a long flight  The clerk did not apologize for the inconvenience  I will probably stay elsewhere next time  
N => My favorite place in Las Vegas Golden Nugget is by far the BEST casino hotel in downtown Vegas  we had such a good time  the hotel was awesome the room was really nice  the bed was very comfortable and all in all it was a wonderful trip the pool there is unreal with the shark tank and the water slide  We have stayed on the strip all our other trips to Vegas but this time we thought we d try staying downtown and it was the best choice we could ve made  super  super good time   A great time was had by all  can t wait to go back           
N =>  gold brick booked on strength of other trip advisor reviews and desire to be off strip for a few days with children great hotel  located right in middle of freemont experience  Rooms large with comfortable beds and good bathrooms   quiet in morning and easy to sleep in  good reasonable priced restaurants  Not a huge hotel but still large however easy enough to get around with children to restaurants pools etc Pool is superb  Slide and fish tank a real feature  kids loved it  bar by pool is good  gaming tables around pool if you are so inclined check out simple and quick as was check in  friendly staff drinks if not gambling pricier than rest of freemont area but you tend to wander anyway All in allwell worth the reasonable price and children friendly 
N =>  Not as good as I expected We received an excellent offer from the Golden Nuggett via email and decided to cut our stay at the Las Vegas Hilton short and stay   nights at the Golden Nugget  It was nice to stay in the downtown area for a short time but I was not impressed with the hotel that much  The front desk check in clerk was bordering on rude  Also never did get my club card as the line was rediculously long all times of day  We ate at the buffet twice and I would say the food was fare but very affordable  We also had bad luck at the slots but that was pretty much the case everywhere this trip  We paid to have an upgraded room in the North Tower  The room was nice enough but still felt dated  The road construction woke us promptly at  a every morning  THAT was a nightmare in itself  Wish I would have known about the construction and either got another room or not stayed there at all  I felt like my upgrade was a downgrade  The pool is excellent  Loved the aquarium in the pool  very cool  The pool deck is too small though for the amount of people there so the chairs are placed smacked up against each other  I did not feel comfortable laying that close to a stranger really  Drinks at the pool bar were very good  I guess this would still be the place you want to stay downtown as the other hotels do not look all that nice  I think next time I will stay at my Las Vegas Hilton and take a taxi down to the Nugget like we have always done in the past  
N => Too Many Glitches    minutes to check in  The pool was completely closed on Sunday  Buffet service cashiers had trouble understanding English  Shower was broken  and when the maintenance man came to fix it he tracked mud all over the shower so I still didn t want to use it  The room door was warped and extremely hard to open and close  The TV was large  but didn t have HBO  Spammers in the lobby kept trying to sell you time shares  Otherwise  it was a decent hotel  No one of these things would put me off the hotel  but taken together they add up and I can t imagine staying here again  
N =>   Awful stay This is one of the worst hotels I ve had stayed at  there were numerous problems with our stay  When my husband and I arrived  we were supposed to get a king bed  After a lengthy check in we were told that we would have to take a room with two doubles  very small   We were ok with that because the hotel said they would contact us the next morning to move us to a new room  When we got to the room  south tower    nd floor  we were not happy  The entire NON SMOKING floor smelled just like a dirty ash tray  especially in our room  Obviously  this floor was at some point a smoking floor  Further evidence was provided in our room by bed sheets with BURN HOLES in them  There was A C in the room but it was very loud and rattling  The next day the staff never contacted us to change rooms  so we had to pester them about it  After numerous phone calls  extended wait times  and hang ups we finally got someone  a manager  to tell us that our new room was ready at  pm  not in the morning as they had promised  When my husband went to the front desk to get the new key  they left him standing there for a half hour before they finally gave it to him We moved to the new room  south tower    th floor   the floor did not smell like smoke and we got the king bed  I thought we were all set  WRONG  Our new room had WET carpet  yes really wet  It was apparent  by the smell  that someone had puked on a few areas of carpet and staff had washed it up with a strong floral smelling cleaner  Yummm  our room smelled like pukey flowers and we had to make sure not to step in the wet spots  This room also had a loud A C  though this one didn t rattle like the previous room  Just to make things even better  the  quot On Demand Movie quot  option on the TV was broken so we couldn t order any movies and the wireless internet was broken in the entire hotel  We were there for a software consultant convention     and imagine    broken internet  And as if this trip was not perfect enough  on our last day there I decided to use a lit make up mirror that electricuted me  Yes  really  the brass base of the make up mirror was live  luckily low voltage   The hotel sent security up to check out the mirror  When they arrived they grabbed the mirror and told me there was no current in it      I then pointed out their rubbed soled shoes and told them to take the shoes off then grab the mirror  duh  simple physics   They didn t want to do that     point is  even if I was some crazy lady and was imagining the whole thing  they should have taken it away with no questions and replaced it  not give me a hard time about it Overall  this place was awful  In addition to all the above  the decor was extremely old  there was no refrigerator in the room  the lighting was poor and it was not worth the money  It s in  quot old Vegas quot  and is a     cab ride  one way  to get to the strip  I heard from some people the renovated North tower was a bit better but it is more expensive and there are still the same issues with staff  if I wanted to spend more money I would have stayed someplace else entirely  
N =>   Was ok but not great Golden Nugget  Las Vegas  NV was ok but not great  Arrived  tember          Reviewed by  Michele  Pennsylvania The pool was nice  the tank in the pool was awesome  small pool but ok  Our room was nice  very large  but wasn t very luxurious like the site had led us to believe  We stayed in the south tower  might be better to stay in the north tower  They boasted about the international beer bar  that was a joke  it was just a plain old bar near the casino exit  there was really nothing special about it  There is no place in there to just get a burger and a beer if you want  They have a suchi bar that was always empty and a noodle house that was also very vacant  Vic  amp  Anthony s steak house  way over priced  Next time we go will will stay on the strip  
N =>   Bad hotel bad service Please do not go to this hotel  This was my trip to Las Vegas  so I was very excited to be there and see the city  I started worrying about the hotel when I stood in line to check in  and had to wait  and wait  because two groups of desk personnel were standing around talking  ignoring the people in line  I had asked for a room with a king bed  and was given a room with two doubles  When I asked if I could get the requested room  I was told no  Just that   quot No  quot  I asked if it was possible to check for the next night   quot I guess you can  quot  was the response  It went downhill from there  My room was dirty  and the staff ran from indifferent to rude  They all seemed to have an attitude that they were at a  rd rate hotel and didn t need to make any effort because no one really cared about the service or the guests  One positive   the nice doormen and bellhops   they were great  
N =>   Worst hotel of American trip When we arrived there was a huge     minute queue at reception We later saw that there was always a long queue at any time of day or night which was a bit of a pain if you just wanted e g  some local info  The reception staff were not forthcoming with any advice or help when we asked them The room we had was clean and quiet but the bed was uncomfortable  The hotel was also uncomfortably cold in all the common areas e g restaurants corridors as the air conditioning was on full blast  Luckily we had an air conditioning unit in our room which we were able to programme ourselves The area where the hotel is located is grim and ugly  There s no   advisable  way to get to the central strip   where all the more glamorous hotels   fun is  unless you get a taxi for the    mile ride  The taxi cost us    dollars each way  The less advisable way is to catch a local bus from the nearby bus station  We tried to do this but failed to do so as we were given such poor info from the receptionist who just wanted us to catch a taxi  The bus station environment was pretty dodgy looking too If you re going to Las Vegas to gamble and nothing else then this hotel is probably OK as it has a casino  If you want to get a bit more out of your trip and want to be somewhere more central then think again  In retrospect  we d happily have paid more and stayed elsewhere e g  on the central strip and we d have saved money on taxis   
N =>   loved the hotel San Antonio texas I bought my husband Mitch for his birthday a trip to vegas  we stayed at the golden nugget hotel great hotel nice room good service did not won any money  but we had fun  I called the hotel direct for reservations they gave me a good deal buy   nights geht   free  thanks golden nugget hotel we be back    Rose from san antonio 
N =>   Not bad for the price Not a bad place to stay  We have alway stayed on the strip and thought it would be fun to stay downtown  The hotel is alot smaller than I would have thought  but very easy to get around  I loved the pool        small but a great place to relax  You have to get there early or you will have a hard time getting a chair  The breakfast buffet was not bad but the dinner one was the worst  We only ate there once for dinner  go to Main Street it is less money and much better  Own room was in the north tower and very quiet  The room was small but the bed was great  The bathroom was the smallest I have seen something close to the bathrooms on cruise ships  Having said all of this I would go back  The staff was great and we really had a great time  
N =>   you get what you pay for It is what it is  The room was fine other than the ever present stale smoke smell in the  quot non smoking room quot     nothing fancy but the bed was comfortable  which is important  the pool is fun  but surely not the hippest in vegas  in retrospect i should have splurged the extra cash to stay closer to the strip   a cab ride to the strip costs about         
N =>   Will Not Return Check in took well over an hour  Obviously several flights had come in around the same time They had to have known we all were coming  The other guests I spoke with had come in on time  as had we  so it was no airline snafu that had caused this sudden crowd So why weren t they staffed for it  I don t know  The room was fine  Not great  and not spotless either  I will say I did enjoy having the vanity and lighted magnifying makeup mirror I did not enjoy being ignored at the entrance to the poker room  I am a nicely dressed normal looking    year old woman  Three separate times I was ignored The pool was nice  I would not recommend  quot The Buffet  quot  Their lack of imagination in naming the place is a clue to the lackluster effort in the quality of food and beverage I had some of the worst service of my life at  quot The Grotto  quot  I m a long time hospitality manager so I will spare you my litany of things they did wrong so as not to sound crazy  Suffice it to say that as our  quot Fancy Dinner Night quot  it really sucked  The food was strictly ok Go to Mamacita s down the street for really good food And Service I won t complain too much about the    hour construction outside our room  After all it is Vegas and I don t expect quiet I mention it for those who knowing about it  would choose to stay on the other side of the street Which is where I will be    at Binion s  
N =>   Economic downturn in Las Vegas  Didn t see it this trip  I stayed from Thursday night late  to Saturday morning  I arrived on Friday morning around      a m   to find about ten people in line  However  there were three desk agents  so check in didn t take as long as I thought it would  about ten minutes  not bad  I was surprised  with what I d read  that it was this crowded on a Thursday night check in  I thought gas prices and foreclosures and such were putting a big bite on Nevada tourism  I ll think that again  Agent was courteous  fast and I had a room in the north tower Room was clean  towels were thick and clean  all appointments very neat  I was on the   th floor  one word of warning  to avoid excessive noise  get a room that does not face west  which faces the pool  There was a pool party Friday night  with loud glass rattling bass until past midnight  Not complaining  after all this is Las Vegas  just a word of caution  Elevators were fast  casino was clean  air conditioner worked well  no complaints in these categories Another word of warning  check your car before and after the valet parks it  I drive my  quot weekend car quot  to Las Vegas  and it had no damage prior to valet parking at the Nugget  After I got it back  and after I was long gone from Nevada  I noticed the door had been opened rather forcefully into a concrete wall  with paint scratched on the edge of the door  and concrete residue present  I m not going to say anything  I doubt the hotel management would respond or do anything anyway  but be cautious if using the valet  and check your car upon receipt  Other than that  excellent hotel  
N =>  Great time at the Nugget Had another good time at the Nugget frorm              check in was quick and the girl  Cindy  took the time to get us the floor and type of room we wanted    it was not a hurry up thing with her  The hotel had plenty of vistors and it was easy to get around  the Pool was the best   plenty of site seeing there  Morning buffet was excellent   even though we got there late still had breakfest food out past       am  so we had a little breafeast and lunch    only bad part of the visit   the maid service was not up to the   diamond standard   forget wash clothes all three days we were there and soap on other days   and I mentioned to a supervisor the problem   it seems one lady just doesn t bring enough of them when she starts in the morning    but for the price   location   and easy in and out parking   the Nugget is great    will be back next Summer using Private Arrangements     
N =>   Another great stay at the Golden Nugget This is our second stay at the Golden Nugget and this time we stayed for    nights  Everyone treated us great  didn t run into even one rude person  We had a room on   th floor in the North Tower  Our view overlooked the pool  amp  could see the mountains  They are building a new tower behind the pool but the construction noise didn t bother us at all  the only thing we ever heard was the crane blow it s whistle when it was moving something  The room was big  amp  the king size bed was so comfortable  Everything was clean  amp  spotless  the maid service was great  everyday they had our room cleaned  amp  new towels etc before noon  The slots were pretty tight at the Nugget  really did most of our gambling at other casinos  but on the day we checked out my wife hit a   times slot for        which was a great way to say see you next year Golden Nugget lol  We also had NO problems being downtown  we never got bothered by anyone  amp  felt very safe  We walked fremont st at all hours of the night  amp  it s very safe  We will be back next year without a doubt    stays at the Nugget  amp  neither time did we ever have a problem so they will get our business every year until they do something that really gets me upset lol  Oh one more thing  we checked in around     pm and it only took   minutes max and we were all checked in  amp  ready to have some fun  and check out was even faster    One last thing  if you book your stay through a travel agent  amp  request North tower be prepared to pay additonal       a night at check in because we were told that when travel agents book your stay it s always at south tower price  That caught me off guard  amp  kind of got me upset but my wife calmed me down so i would stop swearing at the lady at the front desk heh 
N =>   First trip DT  gret experience This was a solo trip for me  my  rd trip in    months and my first DT  I had decided on the Nugget before even looking at other hotels based on reviews here I was overly impressed with the staff from the Valet  bellhops  front desk  My room was ready and it was above expectations  It was a South Tower room on the   th floor  I ate the the Carson St Cafe  and felt the meal was priced accordingly and was a good value  Had room service twice  both times it was hot and delivered quickly I had registerd through Private Arrangements and I know when I return in ember I will be staying once again at the GN  I loved the proximity to Fremont Street and being able to pop in and out of all the other casinos  I did not win at the Nugget s casino but this was not a winning trip at all Only bad service was at the Rush bar  very busy night and only   bartender on  Our group moved over to the Dive bar  which was quieter and we were able to enjoy ourselves  The Tank was awesome  and the staff there handled an emergency evacuation very professionally  All and all an excellant   night stay 
N =>   Great Pool  First time staying off strip  downtown     have been to Las Vegas numerous times  The hotel is very nice  The room was in the North Tower which has been remodeled recently  per other reviewers  and was average  It was clean  The bathroom was small  The buffet was very good and the customer service was excellent  Slots were very tight but we re only supposed to take what we can lose right    The pool was soooo nice  Several hot tubs and cabanas available  Very crowded so it s best to go as early as possible to claim your spot Saw a lot of construction but did not hear it  A huge plus  
N =>   Impressed with the remodel My boyfriend and I planned a Vegas weekend and reserved and paid for two nights at the Mirage After we booked that trip  he got a deal from the Golden Nugget for   free nights    free meals and      to gamble with in the casino  So he decided to go ahead and take them up on our offer and book the rooms for the same weekend we were at the Mirage  The plan was to go directly to the GN  check out the room and facilities  grab a bite to eat and let him blow through that free     After that we d head back to the Mirage  I ll write a review for that as well  I m kind of a  quot new Vegas quot  girl   I was not too excited head over to the old strip   but decided it wouldn t kill me  So we went I have to say I was impressed with the new Golden Nugget  The last time I was there was YEARS ago and I didn t even want to walk in  Now it s all very modern and clean with marble everywhere  Certainly an improvement Our room was on the  th floor and overlooked the pool  I was so surprised at the non tacky  fresh rooms with crisp linens and super comfortable beds  The room had been completely redone with new carpet  marble  wallpaper and obviously bedding  The room was a nice size  but the bath was small   only one person at a time in there There was a desk  internet accessability  etc   but one thing to note  no fridge mini bar They were also very accomodating in the buffet restautant  I wasn t feeling well and didn t want to go to the buffet   but asked my boyfriend if he could bring me back some toast and cottage cheese  They never allow you to take food from the buffet   but they were kind enough to transfer the buffet credit to the cafe where he was able to get me my requested lunch  I thought that was a really nice touch Again  we didn t actually stay over night there   but I did take a nap and all together I think we were there   hours I wouldn t hesitate to go back or recommend this hotel to others   though I have to admit  I ll probably be sticking to the hotels casino s on the new strip  
N =>   A week at the Golden Nugget We spent   nights and   days at the Golden Nugget  This was our first time staying down on Fremont St  We figured that since we always end up playing downtown  we might as well stay there this time We used VIP check in and our room was ready for us when we arrived at       am  They provided a refrigerator that I had asked for when we made the reservations  We stayed in the South Tower on the   th floor  The room was large and the bed comfortable  The carpet has seen better days  but the room was clean and it was re cleaned well each day The pool was lovely and it was quite an experience swimming so close to the sharks  The chairs are close together and the pool gets crowded  so we always went early in the day The only meal we ate at the GN was at Lillie s Noodle House since we had a     meal comp  My soup and sushi were very good and my husband enjoyed his crab rangoon and shrimp dish We did not play at the GN  There Blackjack is not very good compared to the other games close by  El Cortez has some of the best low limit BJ to be found and we spent most of our time there  We also played at the California and the Golden Gate   very loose slots  We made our reservations through the GN websit in advance and they went down twice  Both times I called and they gave me the cheaper rate without any problem  All in all it was a comfortable stay without any issues  My only complaint was that they would not let us know if we could have a late check out in advance  they said they only do that the morning of check out  
N =>   Great Service from Start to Finish This was our fourth stay at this property and it just keeps getting better  When we checked in we had two rooms at casino rate  thank you to James the wonderful host who gave us that deal even though we are low rollers  and I wanted to upgrade my elderly dad who had trouble last visit with the walk from the South Tower  The check in person found his reservation and told me that they had put him in the closer North Tower for the same price  Thank you  He loved his room and the shorter walk  We stayed in the South Tower as usual and were very pleased with our room  We spent a wonderful but pretty crowded day on the  th at the pool  If you are downtown  check out their pool  it s really beautiful and there is plenty of both sun and shade The only thing that marred our visit is my purse was tugged on walking down the hall by a pickpocket  I had a new purse and it was easily unsnapped  We had tickets to a show that were scooped up and stolen  The thieves then had the nerve to actually use our tickets  I also familiarize myself with the hotel I am at  including where security is so I do not have to stand in the middle of the floor screaming like a banshee  I went to the security office by the casino cage and spoke to the head of security  They couldn t have been nicer  Since they cannot be everywhere  they apologized and reviewed the tapes  Unfortunately they could not find the thieves and retrieve my tickets  They informed that if it was their shows they would give us new tickets  but we had to deal with the hotel where the show was  We did finally get to see the show Upon checkout I visited the slot host and did not get any more off our room  but did get a complimentary buffet  Everything was always answered with a smile Try this hotel  they really know what customer service is  
N =>   Wouaw This was the first time we slept in Downtown Vegas  We already stayed at the Luxor  Venetian  Motel    Super   and the Golden Nugget is our favorite   Classy  clean  original with The Tank  not too big  not too small  The room was perfect  We ate at the Grotto and took the breakfast at The Buffet  everything was excellent  Casino was less overcrowded than those on the Strip Yes  we would stay there again   
N =>  Would Stay Again Nice clean hotel   not   plus stars but close   Upgraded to VIP North Tower   nice room  great bed  lots of pillows  great BIG towels  very tasteful  but very dark  tv in the mirror in the bathroom     Would stay in the North Tower again   close to casino    Get to the pool early  too many for such a small  but awesome  pool   Great sound system and good music  amp  Not too uncomfortable being close   Slots very tight   Great to have five dollar tables  but again  hard to win   Breakfast Buffet   good   Evening Buffet too expensive not good quality   Employees   some very friendly  and funny  felt welcome  others   bartenders  very rude  will try to avoid you  at times   Hard to get a drink even with a good tip   Restrooms are hard to find and are few  but Very clean   Hard to figure out the casino floor plan for awhile   Need to not have solicitation by the door  VERY annoying   Construction  well  what hotel doesn t have some kind of construction  We had a view of THE CRANE  but also the pool and the mountains    awesome   Just need to check before making reservation  any hotel    Fremont Experience is entirely different than staying on The Strip   free concerts  light show  easy to walk  and some  quot VERY quot  interesting people   Will stay here again   Neat  
N =>  Completely Ghetto Hotel     Had to have been the WORST hotel to stay in during my   days in Vegas  Even though the arrangements were pre made for me  I was shooting an indie movie with a production company w  a  quot limited budget quot    this hotel sucked    my non smoking room smelled of cigarettes  my room was tended to  but very cursory  no room service  the pool  half way renovated but never saw ONE person working on itThe bar was OK  and the Karaoke Jock was cool  Seems some locals came to that hotel bar to sing karaoke and I made a friend while singing duets with her  Interestingly  NO ONE who stayed in the hotel was hanging out in the bar  and vice versa  Even if you have to cab it from a Motel   to the strip  its a better experience than this hotel  
N =>  Avoid even if you re broke  Sleep in your car  The room was was really dirty and smelly  Never was our room cleaned or beds make on our two night stay  The shower did not have hot water  The remote did not have any batteries  When we arrived we along with    other guests had to climb the stairwell because the elevators were not working  i swear this is true folks   To top it all off  the hotel checkout clecrk wanted us to pay a utility service charge  that I refused to pay  Worst hotel ever  Please tell your friends and loved ones  
N =>   Avoid unless you can t afford to pay more Huge room    king size beds however it smelled of cigarette smoke so badly we had to buy air fresheners from the supermarket  The casino was small and full of locals getting tanked on cheap beer  We ate twice in the restaurant and it was ok but nothing special  The staff we met were friendly and nothing was too much trouble  Stay here if you are on a budget but I m sure there are nicer places in Vegas  
N =>   OK hotel Lady at reservation desk was friendly  Our room was a suite with a view of The Palms  Bed was comfy  Only real complaint I have is the food at the buffet  it was not tasty and kind of bland  TGIF was great though  Bartender was entertaining  Slots were tight  but at the end they loosened up a bit Had a great time  
N =>  GOLD COAST HOTEL the rate at this hotel was not too expensive but offers great luxurious services  Take the hotel shuttle in order to reach the LAS VEGAS strip  I recommend this hotel to those who are planning to visit LAS VEGAS   who wanted to experience pleasure by not spending too much on hotel accomodation  
N =>  Pick another hotel   dont waste your time I dont know were to start  We purchased the upgraded room package for a   night stay Tuesday Saturday  The checkin was pleasant and easy  When we got to the room after walking it felt like a mile down the hallway we found this      looking room  Because we were so hungry we decided to go eat at fridays and verify afterwards they gave us the correct room  Well after dinner we went to the front desk and the woman behind the counter said yes we did get the wrong room  So we had to pack everything back up and move from the  rd floor to the  th floor  Once again down a hallway that felt like a mile long  Well let me say the upgraded room was      better  Now we are ready to shower and found that the we had no hot water  After       minutes of runnning the water we finally got hot water  What a waste of water  After speaking with the front desk again they offered to again move us  Being totally exhausted we did not take them up on the offer but instead get up and turn the water on first and let it run for a    hr before jumping in the shower  Every night the housekeeping people forgot to give us new soap which was also very frustrating  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE  Stay away from the buffett especially the mexican section it was terrible at best  
N =>   great value for money we spent a week here the   th to the   th of october  Staff were brilliant buffet was ok  but last years standard s were better  good shuttle serivce to the strip although only one bus opperates between two hotels  and you can be told to wait for the next bus  good value of money  this was our second visit to this hotel would visit again  The bingo was of very high stantards and the staff were very helpful and polite  good hotel to stay at during our visit to vegas if you dont want to stay on the strip  
N =>  cant wait to return first impressions yes its ok  after booking in with no fuss what so ever given our keys and the room was on the ninth floor   great views  evey thing that was need was in the room  even down to a iron and a ironing board the hotet was just off the strip  but a free shuttle bus ran every       min to the strip eating well think of a country and you can eat that food in any of the clean well ran resturants even a T G Fridays room service was also great thats if you ever get back to your room as there is that much to do    lane bowling alley  bingo hall and the the casino well it was just so over welming at the first  every casino game that you can think of was available the all hotel wsa light airy and clean  the staff was very helpfull nothing was to much trouble we will return ASAP 
N =>  You get what you pay for Front desk and Bell Desk were very unfriendly and made it seem like you were bothering them  Bell desk gave incorrect distances as well  making it more costly to cab  To get to your room  you have to walk through the very smoky casino and then take a shaky elevator  There are   elevators so we never had to wait more than   minutes or so  Rooms are small and bathrooms  especially showers  are even smaller  Water hits the floor because there is no shower door but a small partition  As well  no fan in the bathroom can be somewhat inconvenient  Thermostat to control AC was nice  View was of the top of the building next door of the satellites  Carpet looked dirty from stains and the room smelled the entire stay we were there  Bed was extremely comfortable Maid service was friendly and efficient  We did check in early as well with no problems  Only went to TGI s and it was decent food but nice service  Bowling alley was clean and no waiting to get a lane Wal t on Rainbow is about a     cab ride  The shuttle takes you to Orleans first and then to Tropicana on the strip  If you walk out of Gold Coast and head on Flamingo towards Caesar s  it s about a   min walk over the interstate to the other side of the strip  Free local calls were nice as well  Didn t really feel like we missed anything staying off the strip  
N =>  This place served its purpose This was booked for us as part of a package trip  Unfortunately  our last visit to Las Vegas we stayed at Caesar s Palace so this was never going to live up to that The hotel was ok    the room needed updating and the toilet didn t work when we got there but it was fixed while we were out  It was clean enough although one of the pillows was stained The main problem for us is that it was a    min walk to the Strip or         cab ride   the free shuttle wasn t regular enough for us  So you can t just pop out to see the sights The  port s of call  restaurant was good    the Friday night seafood buffet was excellent and good value We believe that the slots pay better than on the Strip but unless gambling is your main reason to stay   we would recommend a stay on the Strip 
N =>  Adequate I stayed for   weeks   I came over to play in the Poker world series at The Rio  next door  which I originally wanted to get into but was fully booked  This was the closest optionI strongly disagree with the people that have rated this as excellentPrice was good  Room was adequate I never got the superior room which I paid for and got a refund when I found out   Pool was adequateChecking Staff were average   On very tall lady security Guard was very friendly   Cortez room staff were also very nice Hotel was cleanThe food in the Cortez room restaurant was outstanding  Steak outstanding    other two chinese restaurants were ok and TGI Fridays      was adequate but not as good as many Ive been toIn truth  I didnt have any bad experiences but the whole deal didnt quite do it for me  Would I stay again  possibly but Id also consider paying         more and stay somewhere else if I was there for any length of time 
N =>   CLEAN CHEAP NO FRILLS Located off the strip  but was not very far off  I got the room for       a night  and did not know what to expect  To get to the room we had to drag our daughter through the casino  and up to the  th floor  but when we got there  we were pleased  The room was not fancy  and there were no covers on the beds other than sheets  The tv was nice  flat screen  and the room was fairly clean  The view was of an outside wall  and the bathroom area was very small  The shower felt like it was leaning to one side  but it worked fine  These rooms need some updating  but for the price  we felt like we got a great deal  The front desk help and the bellman at the door were very unfriendly and unhelpful also  
N =>   Not so improved   at least for short people  My wife  amp  I stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel  amp  Casino on e            with reservations made through expedia com  This was our second stay at this property as a couple  and I had stayed once before alone Check in was smooth enough  but when we got to our room we noticed that we were put into a room with two queen beds  rather than a king bed  as we had reserved  An immediate call to the front desk was met with an indifferent   Well  call back tomorrow and see if they can change your room for you   My wife was more upset about the indifferent attitude than the mistake in accommodations The room was remodeled since our last visit  the most noticeable difference being the bathroom  The tub had been replaced with a shower stall that no door or curtain   More stylish than practical to my way of thinking  but Hey  we don t have to clean in up   The bathroom sink was now sunk into a large granite countertop about four feet off the floor  which met our       frames about mid chest level  On the whole  we found the changes to be stylish  but not very comfortable or practical  I m sure someone must like them   a tall person  no doubt  The Gold Coast has also added a buffet since our last visit  as well as replacing their    hour coffee shop with a TGI Friday s  Neither was an improvement  to our way of thinking  The buffet was ordinary at best and one visit was plenty for us  The Friday s was OK  but we missed the menu variety of the other restaurant  In addition  the atmosphere and background music made us want to flee ASAP   Probably a corporate strategy to encourage turnover   We had most other meals off site  so we can t comment on the Cortez Room or the Ping Pang Pong Chinese restaurant  There was and aggregation of tables by the buffet that looked like a coffee shop  but it was closed every time we passed On the morning of the second day we moved into a king room on a floor that had not been remodeled  The furnishings were serviceable and the bathroom had th old style tub and sink  which we liked better  with super strong water pressure  My wife used the room service twice and was satisfied with the food and service On the whole  an OK stay  but we probably won t return  We miss the coffee shop and the improvements in room d cor weren t enough to send us racing back any time soon  
N =>  Little Gem  We have been to Las Vegas every year since       and have always stayed on The Strip in the bigger hotels  This year we thought we would try the Gold Coast  having been out to see it on our last trip  This was a wonderful find as far as we were concerned  It was very nice to come out of the hotel in the mornings to peace and quiet and not be in the hustle and bustle straight away as we would on the Strip  The shuttle buses were very frequent   probably about every    minutes and the drivers were very friendly  The staff at the hotel were very courteous and helpful  especially the first day there when I had to find a medical centre as I was unwell  The pool area  although not large  was clean and there was plenty of room to sun ourselves  There was entertainment in the daytime   a jazz group   which my husband thoroughly enjoyed  The evening enterainment was varied  the standard of the groups just as good as on the Strip  The rooms were a little disappointing at first glance  as I thought they were on the small side  but after a day or two I soon got used to it  Overall I think this hotel is very good value for money and would certainly stay there again  if and when we return to Vegas  
N =>  best hotel off the strip Well here we are again this time we decided to move off the strip and we had been to the Gold Coast and liked it so picked it for this holiday what a good move that was nice to go back to after day out not too crowded but plenty going on Had a couple of trips out on the bus one was to Green Valley Ranch which was really nice and they had lovely shops just ask the driver to call out when you get there as they are very helpful the other trip is the Outlet Mall down the road past the airport The shuttle to the strip was very good didn t have to wait hardly at all maybe   mins but that was just once My wife says she wants to come here again next year and usually she likes the strip 
N =>  Service with a smile I have to say that the staff at the Gold Coast Casino were more then helpful  After getting off a red eye flight  i attempted to check in at  a and was pleasently surprised that the front desk agents never even blinked and eye  They even were willing to revise my original reservations  I got a room with a view of the neighboring apartment complex but who cares  who stays in their room in vegas anyway  The property itself was very clean and ammenities very easy to locate  I would definetly stay here again and have recommended this hotel to my friends and all family members 
N =>   Average Hotel Rooms are a little bit small  Beds are too soft  Shuttle service to the strip is great but they charge   dollars per room  
N =>  Golden Place I had to wait to get to the hotel reception for       minutes but then I got an upgrade to the presidential suite and rest is history  Parking was easy and room was really good  
N =>   Once again   a great stay  I forgot to post about our last stay here at the Gold Coast  Happy to say   we still LOVE it   We booked in ch for our ust stay  yes  we know it s hotter than Hades on Vegas in ust   and my determination got us the room at     off the price I started with  They always match the price if you can find a lower one on the web  I called probably   times to keep geting a lower price   The people are always friendly and the buffet is excellent  Very diverse in choices   you can have dinner type stuff at breakfast time  amp  vice versa  We are looking forward to our next stay there  probably in       when the renovations will be complete  AWEOME DEAL  amp  a great place to stay off strip   
N =>   A Bit Too Cool In Vegas but Gold Coast Is Nice This was our second stay at Gold Coast again going with a newer room for a few more bucks  It is well worth it  Vegas was fairly cold respective to normal temperatures  there was as torm front moving through so it was actually rather cool a couple fo days we were there  Just not the same when it s not hot in Vegas  The room was clean but had a wierd smell and the toilet was not clean  however we asked one of the cleaning ladies and she cleaned right away  A non issue really  For     a night it is a clean  cheap and nice place although it is off Strip They still run their shuttle to mid strip frequently so being off Strip is actually a plus for us to get away from the hustle and bustle  The Deuce goes right in front of the property      although you do have to transfer  The buffet here is pretty good and fairly cheap  The only complaint we have is the cashier would not honor the    food coupon per day  she said we had to charge it to our room then have it deducted upon checking out  they did not do that  Casino is nice  not huge but big enough  If you want a bit quieter pace and good inexpensive accomodations  Gold Coast is recommended  We may try somewhere else next trip just to see what else is around  
N =>   You won t be disappointed   go with newly renovated rooms  We stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino for   nights  We were in Vegas to celebrate my husband s   th birthday  The hotel was a pleasant surprise   very well laid out and clean  We booked through Expedia com and got a fabulous deal at just under     for   nights  The Expedia site had been down for service and a savings code was posted to use giving us an additional     off the price  Check in was quick and easy   Upon opening the door to our room we were pleasantly surprised to see such a well appointed clean room   no smell of smoke what so ever  The bed was just like ours at home   we are guessing it was a Beautyrest mattresse  We love our king size bed and so this was just like home Lots of room in the armoire for clothes   ample amount of hangers and an ironing table and iron were provided  Coffee maker was located in the bathroom  Table and chairs in the room were perfect for that morning cup of java The bathroom was clean and lots of hot water flowed from the shower head  Towels were fluffy and soft and crisp white  Toiletries were also available for use   I prefer my own brands but my husband used the bar soap and said it was fine The buffet restaurants were very tasty   we did not eat at any of the other restaurants except for TGIF   it was average  Entertainement was very cruise like but nonetheless it was a great addition to the hotel We did not gamble here but many were  We did not like the smoke filled casino areas since we are quite sensitive to cigarette smoke  In the early mornings and afternoons there was much less smoke   the evenings were terribly smoky I would highly recommend anyone going to Vegas looking for a place to stay off strip that s not too far from Las Vegas Blvd  to consider this location  You will not be disappointed   Happy Travelspanabrite    
N =>  Good value We got a great deal for this place   which worked out great as a stop over on our way from LA to the Grand Canyon  It s not the smartest  most chic place  but for the money we paid we weren t complaining  
N =>  Great Stay for the New Year We arrived at the Gold Coast on our second day in LV after a terrible stay in another hotel  This was heaven and at the same price as the other place  We are avid walkers runners so made our way to the Strip several times a day and took the shuttle when it suited us  The shuttle was always there  with an option to visit the sister hotel at New Orleans  We were told it went to the Suncoast but the driver informed us that this service was now only available from the Tropicana so we never got there  We enjoyed returning at the end of each day to our comfortable hotel with less craziness than the places we visited on the strip  We enjoyed our morning coffee in the room and rarely ate meals at our hotel  I did get a free meal off my players card and it was excellent  The Gold Coast was a great  quot hub quot  for us  a short jaunt to the Strip  yet far enough away to be a bit quiter  The bridge over the I    was a popular unobstructed view of the fireworks    sometimes hard to find in Vegas  We would definitely return  
N =>   Not so GOLDen My boyfriend and I have just returned home from a weekend in las vegas  We stayed at the Gold Coast Casino and Hotel located on Flamingo next to the RIO and across from the Palms  It was an excellent location since we were using Interstate    to go everywhere and the hotel is only   stoplights away from the on ramp  And there was easy access from parking to the casino and easy access to the RIO and PALMS  We booked our trip on the Gold Coast s website and got a good deal      newly renovated premium room      free food credit anywhere at the GC  and     free slot play  we made sure to check reviews and saw mostly positive reviews so we decided to give it a try We arrived Friday around  pm to check in  This is where our excitement turned to disappointment quickly  The lady who checked us in was very unfriendly and just greeted us with a  quot CAN I HELP YOU  quot  After checking us in she told us to sign the transaction  My bf asked how much was being charged to his account and she was very vague about it  He asked again and she snapped back an answer that didn t help us at all  We had to ask her two more times before being told our room required      security deposit plus a resort fee  On their website  they do not clearly state the     security  She then handed us an envelope with two hotel keys and said thank you  She did not even tell us how to redeem our free slot play or free food credit and didnt even tell us our room number or how to get to the hotel rooms  Our room was at the VERY end of the hall on the eighth floor   a pretty lengthy walk with no alternative elevators or stairs to use  There was room service dishes outside of our room as we got there and had to push it down the hall when it was STILL in front of our room   hours later  The room itself was small but nice  My bf and I enjoyed the window in the shower area that opened to get fresh air  The shower was chalky looking on the floor though so I wore my flip flops every time I showered  The walls are pretty thin  I could hear a drunk man    rooms down talking to his friend  I could also hear the people next to us but easily drowned them out with the tv  I really enjoyed the shampoos and conditioners though  and they stocked us generously with them  The bed was VERY comfortable  i wish there was a comforter though   it was only sheets  and the tv was a good size  All in all  it was an OK place to stay for    a night with free food credit and free slot play  The slots were pretty loose there though  We ended up profiting from the free slot play  However  if there were none of those incentives  I would have cancelled our stay and gone over to the new Station Hotel  Aliante in N Las Vegas  Also  my bf and I are in our mid twenties and would definitely NOT recommend this hotel for travelers our age  We would also NOT recommend the buffet  Ports O Call  The food was cold  hard  and old  We suggest trying out the Las Vegas Hilton on Paradise  They had some spacious  newly renovated rooms that are affordable with a modern edge     
N =>   slots fantastic My  rd stay at gold coast and same excellent value Was given newly refurbished room and bathroom was an improvement as now has walk in shower  No problem with being off the strip as shuttle service every       mins  I prefer to stay here as get my pick of slots compared to strip as everywhere packed at weekends  would recommend a trip to Sams Town which is another Boyd Gaming Casino  shuttle picks up just behind where you get dropped off at Bill s My partner was disappointed Captain Charlie s Oyster Bar was closed but was impressed with seafood buffet  Friday Evenings  and also Noodle Exchange  Pool area although small was very good and never got crowded even at weekends I would recommend this hotel to anyone who has seen the Strip several times and looking for good clean accommodation at a good price Have a great stay   
N =>   Don t Stay Here Our bath vanity toilet area were so small and cramped  it was like showering in a travel trailer  We had to remain standing in the tub to dry off it was so small  Could not get the air conditioning to cool the room  Casino downstairs was also boiling hot  Three restaurants owned by Asians  One too expensive  Ping Pang Pong had circulating carts with food on them but no one spoke English so we couldn t figure out how much something was or what it was  The Cafe also run by same group  horrified to find out that the coffee was       same for ice tea and soda  So for any meal add    just for your non alcoholic drinks  I ve never seen prices like that  If our group uses same facility again  we will not sleep there  we ll walk across the street to the Rio or Palms  Tried to go swimming one night  pool supposed to remain open till  pm  they closed it at    pm  Overall a miserable experience  
N =>   great value For only     per night we thought the room was excellent  Very large bed and a large room  The toilet are was small but did not spoil our stay The breakfast was excellent value at less than     You need a higher room or one with an open view as our room looked onto a building which may have been the bowling center  
N =>   Appalling  Hotel has deliberately disabled deadbolts on all rooms I was looking forward to this bargain hotel near the Strip  but encountered an appalling physical defect in my room  There are deadbolts on the doors  but no way to activate them   the hotel has deliberately disabled them I confirmed this with a call to the front desk and then visiting the front desk in person to switch rooms  Originally  I thought it was an issue only with the room given to me   but as soon as I arrived at my transfer room it was obvious that all deadbolts have been disabled at this hotel The deadbolt slides exist   they simply have no knob to turn to activate them  Where the knob mechanism used to be  there is a plastic cap  or in some cases  a bare hole   With a small enough screwdriver I probably could have actually turned the deadbolt  Both engineering and the hotel s  quot supervisor quot  on duty  not a single manager in the property s hotel side at   PM  confirmed that this was a deliberate act by the hotel  and that they consider their room doors  quot secure quot  because they are keycard activated and they have a chain   not a secure night latch  mind you  but an actual     s issue thin chain  Amazingly  the hotel seemed surprised that I was appalled  and they gave me the  quot you re the first person who has ever complained quot  line  It s the   st century  There isn t a major hotel on the planet that doesn t secure its hotel room doors with a deadbolt   except  apparently  for the Gold Coast I m stubborn when sticking to principles  even knowing that I could  quot secure quot  the door if I wanted to with a heavy chair or some such  and even knowing that the odds of anything happening were quite low  because the doors are at least keycard secure  But this is a AAA minimum requirement   a deadbolt absolutely MUST be included with all guest room doors  I can only imagine what female guests might think if they stay at such a hotel So  I was faced with a bit of a Hobson s choice   stay at a hotel that obviously is blase about security  or try to find alternate accomodations on short notice  Gold Coast did offer to refund all charges but did not offer to help me locate any alternatives and indeed  seemed happy to see me go  I had to go back up to the room  get online  and hope to find something on short notice  I ended up paying twice the rate to stay at Bill s Gamblin  Hall  ironically a former Boyd Gaming  quot Coast quot  property  left the Gold Coast  got checked in within   minutes by a friendly front desk clerk  entered my Bill s room   and flipped the deadbolt on the door I cannot possibly recommend the Gold Coast with such a basic  fundamental  and deliberate reduction of guest room security  
N =>   New Year in Vegas This was our first stop on our world tour  We tried to pick reasonably priced centrally situated places throughout and this did not disappoint us  The strip was only a short hop away by the free bus  but easily walkable if like us you enjoy a stroll  The Rat Pack show and dinner on New Years Eve was great  but we were disappointed with New Year on the Strip  We have visited many cities to enjoy the festivities over the years and this did not live up to what we had hoped for  the fireworks at midnight were fab but that was it  everyone just turned round and walked away when they finished  Unlike all other times you could not visit the hotels unless you were resident there  Fortunately the Gold Coast had a great band playing until the early hours so we still managed to enjoy  Would stay here again if we decided to do Vegas for a third time  
N =>   Would stay again in a minute We had a really good idea what to expect as we had read the reviews of the GC here and looked at all the traveler photos  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and check in was very quick  We recieved a room on the  th floor at the end of the hall  Knew what to expect  including the elfin bathroom  The room was very adequate and the bed was very comfy  I absolutely loved having the coffeemaker there  I had brought with me some extra coffee and filters  The maid staff noticed  and started leaving some extras for us  We ate at the buffet twice which was good      but just an average buffet  Not terrible  We also ate breakfast in the Monterey Room twice and thought the food was very good and at a very reasonable price  The casino is well laid out  Very easy to find your way around  Some casinos are an absolute maze  Harrah s  and you get frustrated just trying to find your way out of the the thing  There was a very good assortment of machines and the tables seemed busy  Saturday night there had a real good fun vibe  A fantastic salsa band in the showroom and another good music group in the East lounge  I went upstairs to check out the bowling alley  They have    lanes  and since it was Sat night  it was cosmic bowling with neon and good rock music  Wow  It looked very cool  I had planned on playing some bingo  but our trip just flew by   no time  The shuttles were so convienient  Used it many times to go to the Orleans to eat and to the Strip  The day we got there  I made sure to check the alarm on the clock to see that it was not advertantly on   that happend to us last year at the Flamingo   went off at   AM  But two mornings later  the alarm went off at      AM  Not sure if it got moved by the maid in dusting or what  So be sure to check the alarm status before you go to bed  It seemed that the East lounge had music almost every night and it was all good  All in all it was a great stay  I d stay there again in a minute  A good value all in all  
N =>   good stay at the Gold Coast Six of us stayed at the Gold Coast        for our annual boys weekend  I found this hotel to be an excellent value It had all the basic creature comforts and a    inch LCD TV as well      Check in was a breeze with no waiting around  pm The casino had all of the favorite table slot and video poker games  All the employees we talked to were polite a rarity in Vegas All in all while at was nt Bellageo it was a comfortable place to stay  
N =>   Outdated but adequate We stayed here for two nights  including NYE  It s outdated  and needs an upgrade  but it s about right for the price  The bathroom is tiny  We had a couple of problems  first we couldn t get the internet to connect  but maintenance came by quickly and solved the problem  But then they stuffed up the television while fixing the internet  and had to come back again to fix it  The room was not very clean  We found a belt and a few old fries in the room the first day we were there  Beds were okay  pillows were awful  A little far from the Strip  but the bus service was fine  We ate in the diner  and the food was good and reasonably priced  Next time I d stay somewhere closer to the strip and a little more upmarket  though  
N =>  Gold Coast Hotel not that Golden Booking problems at Travelocity  We booked our vacation on line through Travelocity  We encountered a problem with our reservation  our departure flight was midnight and therefore  we could not use our last night of hotel  which the computer system had automatically booked and charged us for  We called Travelocity about this issue  we were lost several times in the transfer between agents  Needless to say  we had to call repeatedly and it was very frustrating  We wanted to file a complaint  but the agent refused to give us a phone number  She provided an email address for us to file the complaint but it turned out to be unregistered Hotel Gold Coast hotel was clean and had good facilities for people with diability  The bed was too soft and it felt like the mattress was wrapped in plastic  It was also noisy when you moved at all on the bed  The shuttle that runs between the hotel and the strip requires a wait of about    mins Grayline Airport Shuttle Service We also booked this on Travelocity     per person each way   This is a highly unreliable service  The shuttle failed to pick us up at the hotel on our last day  We called them and they claimed that they had come by but left after   mins because we weren t there  They considered this a  quot no show quot  and as such  would not come by again  This was not possible as we were waiting at the pickup location for    minutes  We asked to speak to another agent  but during the transfer  they hung up on us  Our impression is that this happens quite frequently  During our wait for the shuttle  we were told several times by taxi drivers that the shuttle would not come  Of course  at first we were sceptical because the taxis were ompeting for business but in the end  their prediction was true  We took a taxi to the airport  it took    mins and cost         
N => Excellent buffet restaurant We were allocated a room at this hotel by the travel company who organised our tour  We had no problems checking in but had difficulty finding the lifts as we had to make our way through the casino and bar to get to our rooms The room was a good size with two large beds  clean  amp  comfortable  amp  we liked the separate washbasin  amp  shower areas  We also liked the LCD tv  The buffet restaurant was not very well signed but when we got there it was well worth the long walk through the casino   the choice of food was huge  amp  the staff were well organised  amp  very helpful There was a free shuttle bus available for getting onto  amp  back from the strip which was an excellent service We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel  
N =>  ent clean good value yet plain Gold Coast Hotel Casino is on W Tropicana Bl about a mile off the strip  It s next to the Rio and across the street from the Palms  They have updated the rooms since my stay  when I was there the decor could only be described as  quot early motel chic quot   The rooms were clean  albeit dated  but the mattresses were ready to be retired  However  for     a night during the week who can complain  I found daily housekeeping to be rather thorough and have no complaints as to the cleanliness of my room  The bathroom  separate vanity with  quot closet quot  and tub shower toilet room  was tiny  if you re tall taking a shower is going to be a somewhat painful experience  I was underwhelmed by breakfast in the coffee shop  my soft poached eggs were hard  but bar service was excellent once they figured out I m a generous tipper  Valet parking is a bargain here and tipping the extra couple of bucks insures you won t wait more than   minutes for your car  Bellhops are friendly but not pushy and they get your luggage to your room fast  We partook of the entertainment opportunities next door at the Rio  which is a   minute walk from Gold Coast  Front desk staff was friendly and efficient both at check in and check out  For as much time as we spent in our room it was money well spent  I m not a fan of Vegas  we were there to surprise a friend for his birthday  but I d stay here again if needed  
N =>   Good place to stay The Gold Coast was a good choice to stay off strip  rooms were very clean and spacious with LCD tv if you wanted a tv  very quick check inand check out with polite staff  only used the ports for Breakfast which was good especially the omelletes Transport is provided to the strip every    mins or so but is not thatfar to walk especially after breakfast would stay here again 
N =>  Loved Gold Coast Great spacious room  Much better than we bargained for   Will come again  We are here every few months so we will make sure we book again  We would have booked for two more nights but could not cancel the other reservations  We had no idea how nice the rooms would be  very clean  flat screen tv and it was quiet  We did not eat here but only because we had made other plans  Too many places to eat   so little time  
N =>  Skip gold coast I just got back from the gold coast hotel nwxt to the rio  It was terrible and it smelled  The bathrooms are so small and the rooms have no bedspread on the beds  Thier were bugs in the tub  and the locks are so old they do not stay locked  No deadbolt or anything  The food was okay but nothing to write home about  The good thing was it did have a flat screen tv and a nice bed  I would not stay there again  Stay on the strip  it is a much better deal  
N =>  Good deal and stay We booked this place because of the reviews in most sites and we were not dissapointed  Our room was clean and quiet  Just off The Strip but there is a bus that will take you there and it comes every   min and runs past midnight  Gold Coast made our first time in Las Vegas even more memorable  
N =>  Not quite the same This was our group s fourth visit to the Gold Coast in   years so we know what to expect and I think others have explained it pretty well  It is a good value for the money  but we thought it has taken a turn for the worse  We usually start with the breakfast buffet and didn t find all the selection we had seen in past years  They still make the made to order omlets and you won t go hungry  but about a third of the buffet choices were gone  We had one dinner and definitly won t eat another dinner there The casino seemed dirty and very smoky  like I said we have had visits in past years and this was a change   The ash trays were overflowing and there were ashes in seats and on machines  It was unseasonably cold when we were there this weekend       through        but the air conditioner could not keep up and our room was warm and very noisy when it did run  They still present the coupon books  but no longer offer all the coupons they once did This was a spot we had recommended to many of our friends and family  but I think next year we will look for something else  
N => Gold Coast Fantastic Value  We just returned from a   night stay at The Gold Coast Hotel We found it to be exactly what we wanted which was most importantly a clean hotel and for the most part quiet We arrived late so we didn t get a room with a view but we did get a handicap room so it probably worked out to our advantage because the bathroom had a walk in shower and plenty of room for two to move around in We only looked out our window once when I heard the employees taking their smoke break outside and a truck backing up early in the morning to deliver supplies  The a c was very loud for me because it turned on and off several times during the night  So in order to solve that problem we kept the a c on very high during the daytime when we weren t there so that the room would be plenty cool when we got back in to sleep so we could turn the a c off   I hated wasting energy but I had to sleep The slot games in the casino were fine and we won a few times but in the end we probably broke even  We did make up for it though in comps because it was my husband s birthday and we received extra comps for him so we had a free breakfast one day in the buffet area I would have like to have seen the buffet area with a little more variety especially since we didn t want to waste time eating somewhere else for breakfast We had a rental car and found it very easy to get from the airport to the hotel  We did have a GPS system but the self parking was never full and we always were able to get close to the entrance door The hotel was directly across from The Rio and very close to The Palms  I felt safe enough walking with my husband but I would not walk alone to either of the hotels because there were a few strange men walking around alone PROS  of the Hotel  Clean  great value  nice to come back to after a long day on the strip  My husband loved the flat screen tv in the bedroom  That really helped to update the room CONS  There is not a lot of non smoking areas in the casino  The ventilation is not great so if you are surrounded by smokers you will probably be forced to move At the cash cage they would not take back my change  I thought that was ludicrous since I won most of the change in their casino I didn t want to go back on the airplane with   lbs of change We wanted to take the shuttle to the strip one day and the valet guys were rude to us when we asked them where do we pick the shuttle up and when does it come by  They shrugged their shoulders and said we could pick it up somewhere around the corner and they didn t know when it left last but that it may come every half hour  I would think that they could have a two way walkie talkie to find out where the shuttle is especially since we ran around the corner and saw it leaving  If the valet or front desk had the correct information they could have asked the shuttle to wait a second since we were trying to flag it down So we ended up taking our rental car anyway  We will still probably come back to the hotel to sleep but we probably won t use the casino as much unless the ventilation is re worked  
N =>   good hotel with loads of amenities just got back from a   day stay there    like others have said  the bathroom is small  But  you re not living in it   so no big deal  Enough room to shower and go to the bathroom  love the wall mounted tvs  beds were the best of hotels I have stayed at in a long time      didn t have the gross heavy bedspreads that many other mid level hotels use  the bathrooms have the     s look  brown tub  brown toilet  brown sink counter  etc       but all was pretty clean casino was smoky  but all pretty much are  gave fun little  quot funbooks quot  at check in for random things at hotel  Liked this   got a free pack of cards at the souvenir shop      off at the casino coffee shop    free cocktail coupons  all of which can be used at this casino despite   of them saying valid only at other boyd gaming properties   and other coupons I didn t use  food   tried the ports of call buffett for breakfast  free for me with the room res  and dinner  Thought the dinner was a bit overpriced for the quality of food  great deal on quantity of food     however  I m not that big an eater so can t make buffets worthwhile  If you like buffetts  you ll probably like it  Also  tried the Monterey Room    good  but nothing to write home about  Loved the Cortez room  It seems to be the nicest of all the restaurants at the hotel  Had delicious crab legs there  Lobster was good too Shuttle to the strip was excellent  They don t seem to have a real set timetable  was told about every       min   but we never had to wait very long in either direction  At night  it can get busy   my guess is it has a lot of non Gold Coast people taking the shuttle to the Palms or the Rio  both next door  and Rio Palms guests taking it to the Strip since their shuttles don t seem to be as often     if they d actually check for hotel keys   then I m guessing it wouldn t be as busy room was pretty clean i had a not so nice encounter with one of the front desk supervisors  but a quick call to the director of operations resolved it to my satisfaction overall  pleasant stay  would consider again for the next trip to vegas  
N =>  Ok for a budget stay Honestly  I can t imagine staying here again  And I can t imagine staying here as a first time visitor to Las Vegas  Really  find the few extra dollars to stay somewhere decent  It s off strip  and it is far longer than a  quot    minute walk quot  to the strip as another review mentioned Very basic rooms  tiny bathrooms  but no cleanliness issues  everything was clean enough  and old enough  Swimming pool was tiny   a joke It took me over    minutes to check in on a Friday afternoon  and three trips back and forth to reception to get keys that worked and the right room type  On the positive side  I really liked the casino  it has an  quot old Las Vegas quot  vibe to it  including lots of smoke if that bothers you  And the food in the coffee shop  Monterey   was cheap and the service was quick  Also  the Chinese place there is very good if you like authentic Chinese  hot pots and noodle soups I would return in a second to spend time on a meal or some casino play  but I can t think of any reason why I would stay in the hotel again  
N =>  No question this is a two star hotel the minute we walked into the hotel  we were attacked by a strong tobacco odor  The hotel has obviously been around for too long  no sign of rehabbing the rooms  The bathroom was small  the shower was prefabbed and tiny  I was here only because I was attending an event here and the cost of the event includes accommodations  Not my choice of hotel to stay in  
N =>   Overall good for the price We had been to the Gold Coast before  but never to stay in the hotel  We spent e  th and  th there and overall  it was a pretty good experience  especially for the price        per night   The positives were the price was great  the room was very quiet  the    in tv was a nice touch  Check in was quick and easy and we checked out using the TV  so that wasn t a problem either  Security checked room keys each evening and made sure nobody got upstairs without one  They offered us a  pm checkout when we checked in  and since our plane left late that day it was a very welcome offer  The       porterhouse steak dinner in the Monterey Room was delicious and perfectly cooked and they were happy to give us a soda in place of the beer that usually comes with that special  There was an ironing board with an iron in the room  a nice extra  The coupon book had nice freebies in it and came in very handy  We needed a refrigerator for medication and it was brought very quickly  and when the a c went out they sent someone up within    minutes to check it out  The customer service was exceptional at this hotel  The negatives  The mattress was one of those memory foam ones  and we just couldn t get used to it  We like more support than those give  but again the price of the room made up for that  The bathroom was super tiny  you had to lean against the tub to close the door to do your business  The color in the bathroom  mud brown  was kind of depressing too but the water pressure was good   The a c was very very noisy and worked erratically until they sent someone up to check it out  After they changed the absolutely filthy filter  and adjusted the thermostat it kept the room cooler  but it was still super noisy Overall  it was a good place to stay  and I would book there again for a short stay  Because of the bed though  I would probably skip this hotel and go to the South Point for longer than two nights  
N =>  GREAT STAY but bad experience at checkout left sour taste in mouth We were here the last week in  and had a great stay   a bad experience at checkout is the only thing keeping me from giving it   stars  The Gold Coast was a quiet oasis from the noise and humanity of the strip  Check in was quick   we got a king smoking which was requested  Nice southern strip view of mountains  Luxor and planes landing at the airport  Room was large  bathroom small as others have said  but it wasn t a big deal  Very clean  maid did a great job every day we were there  Great TV  WIndows opened which was a plus for this nonsmoker married to a smoker  Hotel does cater to an older crowd but us    somethings didn t find that to be a problem  We were there to relax and unwind and the big band wedding singer type bands were great    dollar BJ was always available      JoB Video Poker was plentyful   Food was cheap and good  We had the steak buffet on Sunday night and it was the best steak from a buffet that we had ever had  Ice cream was awesome  Coupon book was excellent   free drinks  match play  ice cream  two for one specials  This isn t the place to stay if you want to lounge around the pool  It was very small  but not crowded  Shuttle to the strip was easy to use and left us at Bill s  formerly the Barbary Coast  which is right next to Bally s and across from the Bellagio  Great location mid strip  We also took the shuttle to sister property Orleans  Wish they had a shuttle to Sam s Town or the Boyd properties downtown  Here was the only problem  At checkout  I first went to check and see if I earned any comps and the Gold Coast Club lady said yes and that I could have it applied to my room charges  Then went to the front desk and they said no  I couldn t  I said I had just been to the comps desk and they said yes I could  She phoned to check and    minutes later  all of it standing at the front desk  waiting for someone to confirm that I wasn t lying  I ended up back at the comps desk  very upset  so they could give me a voucher for cash  Apparently the  quot card reader quot  was down at the front desk  Why did it take    minutes for the front desk to realize this  Why the phone calls  Why did I have to go back to the comps desk for an explanation  This forced us to miss eating a sit down lunch before we went to the airport  I know this is minor and I had a GREAT stay  but it left me feeling bad   All in all  we will be back because it was a good hotel for a very modest price  Definitely stay here but learn from me and leave some extra time at checkout  
N =>   Nice hotel for cheap price Hotel was nice and clean  staff was friendly but front desk was slow Upon arrival there was a long line of people waiting to check in  I waited maybe       mins in line  The casino was a bit small  but for all you black jack players  you must play the  quot super fun deck quot   It s a double decker and your chances of winning are greater than playing a   decker  The location of this hotel casino was not the greatest but it was okay  It s located maybe   miles off the strip but it s definately worth the money   less than      night compared to      night  
N =>   Clean but very dated My friends and I stayed for   nights as part of a package tour  As soon as I walked into the lobby  I wondered what I d let myself in for  The hotel is dated and could do with a complete refurbishment  Having said that  it was reasonably clean  which is very important to me We had requested a smoking room via our travel agent but this hadn t been honoured  We asked to be moved but were told this couldn t be done until the next morning at the earliest  when a room might be vacated  Early the next morning  we went back to reception and were given a smoking room straight away You have to show your room key to security at night to access the lifts but a couple of times I went to my room on my own and felt uneasy because the corridors are long  narrow and intimidating  Our room was a good size with two double beds  table and chairs and a coffee machine   The coffee was disgusting so I d recommend using the coffee shop downstairs in the hotel   There was also a brand new flat screen TV on the wall  which looked completely out of place in the dated room  I don t know about anyone else but I would have preferred a more modern decor over a shiny new TV Now the bizarre bathroom  This can t have been changed since the hotel opened in       You have an open dressing area with a sink and mirror  and a clothes rail  This area offers no privacy  as there is no door and it s right by the window  Next to this there is a tiny bath shower room with toilet  I practically had to stand in the bath to close the door  The bath was an odd beige moulded plastic unit from floor to ceiling  in the absence of tiles   with a beige toilet  It was clean but totally unappealing   there s definitely something to be said for a nice white bathroom suite We had a good view of the Stratosphere  the Wynn and Circus Circus from our room but I know others face a brick wall We didn t eat at the hotel because a  we chose to eat elsewhere while we were out and b  without going into detail  we d heard stories from several people in our group which had put us off Personally  I felt that two days in Las Vegas was long enough   I much preferred my stay in Los Angeles  For that reason  I don t think I ll return to Las Vegas in a hurry and if I did  I would not stay at the Gold Coast  I d spend a bit more money and stay at a nicer hotel on the strip  
N =>  I hate my hotel room My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas this past wknd mainly for his final bowling game that took place at Gold Coast  We actually would have never considered staying there  however  after all the researches I ve done on other hotels for this Cinco de o  Kentucky Derby  and Oscar de la Hoya fight wknd  we had to give up and book Gold Coast instead  All other hotels on the Vegas strip were above       which we just could not afford  so we ended up booking Gold Coast for about      a night  When we first got to our hotel floor  we were actually quite excited for the fact that they put us in the first room closest to the elevator lobby  Not until the next morning  I found out that we were in the worst room possible  Right across the hallway  there was a Maintenance Staff room  We stayed at this hotel for   days   nights  and every single morning  starting between      am  the housekeeping ladies would start their work  They kept going in and out  in and out of this Maintenance staff room  which had this heavy door banging closed everytime they walked in or out  Another problem was these ladies just would not keep their conversation down for nothing  Let me remind you that it was  am  Everyone knows that if you re in Vegas  you probably don t go to sleep at night until the wee hours  and no one will hardly wake up at  am  These ladies were talking like they are in a very noisy flea market or something  and they didn t talk  they screamed at each other  in Spanish   This happened every single morning  and we couldn t get relocated to another room due to the crazy wknd it was  Nothing in the room was up to any standard  except the nice flat screen TV  The individual A C unit was loud as hell when it s on  The two supposedly queen beds  feel more like a twin to me  were terrible  It felt like the springs in the mattress were near death  Also  the bathroom was terrible  I ve never been in such a tiny bathroom ever in Las Vegas  I thought I went to Europe or something where they re famous for having smaller bathroom  It s America here  and it s Las Vegas    what happened  I guess there s definitely a great reason why all other hotels were charging             or      a night  while Gold Coast was charging         I should have known better    O well  I learned my lesson  
N =>   Cold showers and no ice cream          Just got back from a three night stay at the Gold Coast on il   th  This was our second stay  the first being back in ch of     Our ch      stay was great  and I wrote a glowing review on here  despite the fact that the bathrooms are ridiculously small and very dark  and the rooms are clean but just adequate  with terrible views I can not write a positive review this time  quite the opposite  We were excited to get back to Vegas for our second visit  and to the Gold Coast  since we had such a pleasant experience last time  We booked the hotel a month in advance and requested a higher floor facing the street  Sure  said the booking agent  We got neither  the girl at the desk said it was because of a bowling convention that was staying there  I guess bowlers get preference  What we did get was a room on the  th floor facing an ugly roof top that had no hot water the entire stay  When I complained the morning after we arrived about the cold water  I was told that it was because we were at the  quot end of the hall quot  and to  quot let the water run  quot  That night when getting ready for dinner we let the water run for    minutes and it never got beyond tepid  When I called to the office  I wasn t offered anything  We took tepid ice cold showers the entire stay  Twice I called for the manager  twice I was told she was not in  twice I was told she d call us promptly upon returning  and twice she did not have the courtesy to contact us as promised  She never did respond to our call  The package we were on  the Spring Getaway came with a     dining credit that we were not able to use because the desk personnel didn t set up our account properly  which caused us embarassment in the restaurant twice when trying unsucessfully to use it  Both times we tried to use this credit  we were left standing in the front of the restaurant for    minutes while they were trying to  quot verify quot  the credit  calling the front desk which was    feet away  but who would not answer the phone The buffet food was so so  and the restaurant food was just okay  The dealers were mostly rude  the casino stinks terribly of cigarettes because it is old and has terrible ventilation  The pool is small and nothing to mention  really  The coupon book that they promise you may not be worth a million dollars  but it does have a coupon for a nice bottle of wine with dinner  an ice cream cone  free drink  etc  Nothing Earth shattering  but still we counted on getting it as it is on their website  and also because we got one last year and really liked it  This stay  however  we were told they were out of the coupon books but would be gettting new ones at the end of the week  We were leaving on Wednesday  we asked would they still honor the coupons  We were told basically  too bad  the coupon book is  quot complimentary quot  and is not guaranteed  This irked me  I wanted the free bottle of wine and ice cream cone     They could have definitely handled this better  not just to say that they d have more at the end of the week when they knew we weren t going to be there  They could have given us a free cone and bottle as a gesture  but they chose not to  and that irked me In the end  we got a     credit off our room because of the cold water  I think I ve taken more relaxing showers while camping  and the fact I had ice cold water in my room  was worth more than    bucks  But  whatever  I would not ever stay here again  which is a shame  because I ve been speaking so highly of them for the past year to others  Next time we will stay anywhere but the Gold Coast  mainly because I like hot showers and hotels that deliver what they promise as  quot complimentary quot   even if it is only an ice cream cone and a cheap bottle of free wine  
N =>   Very Basic We stayed over the weekend and found the hotel clean enough but all the extras were pretty basic  The pool was so small that it wasn t worth going to  The clientele in the casino has a lot to be desired  The rooms were clean and large  bathrooms are a bit old and need new tile  The coffee shop was decent but the Chinese food restaurant had food that was not recognizable  Casino is small so you can find your friends easy enough but there was no glitz that is for sure  It s good enough for the money but if you want glamour  stay on the strip  
N =>  Loved the Gold Coast Stayed in the Gold Coast for a week in ch to celebrate a   th birthday  It was excellent  Rooms are spotless  Hotel staff bend over backwords to help you  Location is excellent  you are approx    mile from the centre of the resort  They run a shuttle bus all day to  amp  from the strip  The hotel  amp  casino has a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere  We all gambled  amp  won more than we lost   We will book to stay again at the Gold Coast when we next visit Las Vegas  
N =>  Really Recommend this hotel  We have previously stayed at the MGM but decided to try a hotel off the strip  The price for this hotel was excellent  Would certainly stay her again as the savings on accommodation can be used for enjoyment  The shuttle service to and from the strip was excellent  never had to wait very long either way  Couldn t fault anything at the hotel and would really recommend it to anyone  
N => Enjoyed our stay at the Gold Coast  We have stayed at the Orleans several times over the past few years and liked it  When we were planning to go to Vegas the first two days of Thanksgiving week this year  we decided to give the Gold Coast a try  This was mainly because we found an unbelievable rate of     a night   They were celebrating their   th anniversary   We laughed later  because we realized we were paying more to board our dog each night than for our room  We really enjoyed our stay at the Gold Coast  The bathrooms are rather outdated  but were very clean  The room was fine  the bed was comfortable and we enjoyed the casino  I do think that the casino had a little more of a smoke issue than the Orleans  but really  they all do a little  We found the shuttle to be very convenient and quicker than from the Orleans as it is a little closer  And we used the city bus a couple of times when the shuttle was not right out front   You just have to walk across the street in front of the Palms to catch it  Since we bought a pass to use on the Deuce along the strip  it was no extra to use that bus as well  We also ate in the buffet for breakfast and found it to be a good meal and an excellent value  The only thing I found a little depressing was the view from our window of some apartments behind the hotel  But that was not really a problem  We are planning to stay at the Gold Coast again soon It is an excellent value for the money  even when they are not running such an amazing special  
N =>   Nice clean hotel but We stayed from                  The room was clean  location was good  The only real problem we had was the hot water  We were in a room at the very end of the hall and in order to get hot water we had to run the water for at least    minutes  Not a big deal but not very convinient either  Everything else was good  We also used the shuttle bus to the strip which was very convienent  
N =>   Not Bad But Not Great Either  My husband  amp  I stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino for four nights  Overall  the hotel was not bad  We got a fairly good rate      for Sunday      for the weeknights  plus they took off another    percent for AAA discount   The hotel is convenient to the strip and we found the shuttle service reliable  at times  we used the shuttles from the Rio which is right across the street   The room was clean  a decent size and included a refrigerator  at no extra charge   as well as a coffee maker  We basically had   complaints  It took over   hours to get checked in  Friends of ours who arrived later than us  got their room before we did  The bathroom was absolutely tiny  And be prepared to shower in the dark if you plan on bathing in the evening or night time The hotel was certainly adequate for our stay in Las Vegas  but we re not sure that we would go back there again  
N =>  Nice Price but otherwise Ho Hum We stayed at this property two non consecutive nights  the night we flew into  and the night before we flew out of Vegas  They were both standard rooms  king size  non smoking  The first room was better than the last  We booked on the hotel s website and were very pleased with the     rate  esp  for a Saturday night   I felt pretty confident because of the positive reviews on this site  However  I was disappointed  In Vegas we usually stay WAY off strip  since we don t gamble and I abhor cigarette smoke  But a few years ago we stayed at the Monte Carlo and had a lovely time  the room was beautiful and the hotel was pleasant in every way  And we enjoyed an equally excellent rate  Gold Coast was a very different experience  We had to shlep our stuff through their sleazy  smoke choked casino to get to the room  There was barely room to pass between the bar patrons and the glaze eyed gamers  Our trek to the elevator was accompanied by their blaring  quot entertainment quot   I guess there s a nice symmetry to the totality of every sense being assaulted when one is already frazzled after a long day traveling  The room was pretty much as described in earlier reviews  plain  but adequate  spacious  with a big tv and an old  brown bathroom  Our first room was quite clean  the second less clean  The second room smelled smoky  The beds were comfy enough  but the bedding was thin with no extra blanket in sight  The climate control could use updating  too noisy to leave on at night  and the second room wreaked of smoke when the heat was on  The staff were okay  I got a free ice cream cone  But I won t be tempted by the nice rate again  
N => good place to play Liberal blackjack   excellent sportsbook  friendly service and loose comps  Non touristy off strip casino  
N =>   A ent Place to Stay In Las Vegas My husband and I were looking for an affordable place to stay in Las Vegas for a night in tember and chose the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino  When looking at the prices of the hotels we have stayed in past years we were shocked to see how high they have gotten and decided that for the one night we were passing through we d save some money and stay elsewhere There was no line at the reception desk  a rarity in Las Vegas  and the staff were pleasant  When we got to our room we checked out the bed and found some hairs on the pillows  Everything else was clean in the room  but it looked like the maid had taken a nap in the room after she cleaned it  or something  We called to the front desk and asked for another room  They gave us another room  but we had to go down and get the key  It would have been more appropriate if they d brought us the key since we d already been inconvenienced  but such was not the case  Anyway  the new room was fine and had everything we needed  The bathroom had a little window in the shower stall that opened which was nice as it wasn t too hot out in the morning and the fresh air felt good  My only complaint with the room was that there is a charge to use the internet  This was the last night of our trip and we d gotten complimentary wireless everywhere else we d stay so we decided to save our money and get online when we returned home the next day  We enjoyed playing the slots at the Gold Coast as they have quite a few nickel slots which allowed us to play longer on our money  They d given us some coupons as well and we used them at the coffee place in the casino   very convenient for a quick breakfast  All in all  the Gold Coast was a decent place to stay  There were a few things that could have been better  but overall it was a good experience  We d stay there again if we can t find a reasonably priced place on the Strip  
N =>   Good Value Hotel good location This is good value hotel  although much busier at weekend there was much less queueing than at the other  perhaps more glitzy  hotels we visited  so it makes a good base  particularly when using the shuttle bus to the Flamingo to access the rest of the strip  Perhaps more choice on food would help  Terrible Mikes burger bar has disappeared despite being in literature   but what was there was reasonable value  particularly breakfast buffet  Bowling lanes a useful feature if travelling with kids  and again  easy to get a game without a wait  
N =>   Wish we could have stayed longer    Stayed at the Gold Coast for just one night   a Saturday  as we returned from   weeks in Florida  before flying home to the UK on Sunday We were the only ones at the check in desk  so were dealt with very quickly  We were lucky enough to be allocated a suite for the price of the room        What more can we say   a fabulous end to our vacation    We even won a few Dollars in the casino        
N =>  Upgraded to a suite no charge Stayed for just a night but got upgraded to a one bedroom suite at no charge without even asking for it  Room was very spacious and quiet on the   th floor  All for        on Travelocity  
N => Can t beat the price Was originally given a room on the first floor     needed some updating  a good rug shampoo and smelled a little smokey from the casino underneath  We were moved from the first floor due to a power outage on the second night of our stay to a room on the sixth    much better room  cleaner  etc  only draw back was that the shower did not drain well  All in all we had a good stay  would return again based upon room prices and location  Gold Coast your rugs in the rooms and general area all needed a good cleaning but for        a night  sometimes you have to compromise to save a few bucks  
N =>  win here Stayed here      e       Bedrooms ok beds clean  linen changed each day and towels  Air conditioning   free safety deposit boxes  Have stayed on th strip numerous times  but this was a cheapy too good to miss  Regular free shuttle to strip  Pool clean and quiet  We won more here than any other  strip  hotel and of course lost too  but our money and games lasted longer  No problems  little book of freeby drinlks and money off offers from the hotel which we also used  I would stay there again for the same price we paid  I cannot say we had any problems or complaints  
N =>  worth the money i just came from the gold coast  of may to the    may    me and my wife we have a lot of fun we enjoy our stay it was quite enjoyable only that the smokeing that always smell in side the room by reading all the previous reveiws i was not disapointed in no way i love the gold coast very much the food was excellent e t c i would return anytime to the gold coast 
N =>  good value for money but staff unhelpful We stayed in the Gold Coast for   nights in il of this year with our two teenage boys and although we found it excellent value for money we did have a problem with our room on the first night  finding that when we arrived after traveling for more than   hours there was only one giant bed in the room rather than   doubles which had been specified when booking  When we pointed this out to the staff at reception they told us that they had no other room available that night and we spent the night with one teenager on a rollaway bed and one on the floor with lots of extra sheets and blankets  We had arrived too late to look elsewhere  The following day we had to ask again for a new room which we got by the afternoon  much nicer than the previous one which had been quite shabby  dark and smelly obviously the last available room in the hotel  Apart from that we found the hotel to be fine  nice bowling alley  pool  shuttle to strip  our new room was big and comfortable and clean  the buffet was good value  nothing spectacular   The staff though could have been a bit more friendly and helpful and because we had booked the room through a third party they took no responsibility for the bed mishap although during our holiday in U S staying in   different hotels this problem did not reoccur  Even on their computer our booking clearly stated   people   room and it doesn t take a genius to work out that we needed   double beds  
N =>  Good value but rooms a bit tired I booked a room as a    via priceline for     for a weeknight  It was a good value although the room was barely a    room and was somewhat tired  especially the small bathroom   The casino was good especially if you are looking for tables with low limits     tables were available during the week   Buffet was average although inexpensive and there were a number of other dining choices  Although it s not on the strip  the location is good  right in between the Palms and Rio I was somewhat unhappy that I could not get a non smoking room although I was lucky in that the room I got did not have an unpleasant smell  I booked several weeks in advance and requested a non smoking room  and the front desk confirmed that it was noted on my reservation   In addition  I checked in very early   around   PM  Thus I am skeptical of their claim that they could not put me in a non smoking room  If you require one  I would not risk booking a room at this property  
N =>  lots of problems  I booked this hotel on advice from travel advisor  Right when we arrived  they told us they could not give us a non smoking room as we requested  so our room smelled like cigarette butts  Also   it was a room right next to the elevator so we heard every  quot ding quot  throughout the night and got bad sleep  On top of this the Internet is     to use  which is ridiculous considering the hotel costs  It didn t work right away and we had to wait and have a tech come up to fix it  which wasted our evening  The buffet is forgettable  and the drinks plain You are better off spending a bit more for a hotel that actually cares  
N =>  gold coast hotel We stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel from ch   th to the   th        Nice place  with friendly service  We fit   in a room comfortably  The bathroom feels small because of the dark colors  The hotel gives each person a free coupon book  They comped us   free buffets because we had to change rooms when my son overflowed the toilet  The food was good  ice cream was great  Entertainment in the lounge was called Frontpage and the girls are excellant singers  The shuttle worked great for us  ran every    minutes as promised  The only things I didnt like was the lack of quarter slots and the long walk to our car  I would stay here again if I wanted a comfortable place off the strip  
N =>  Not Disappointed Just returned from a trip to Vegas with one other couple  We were not disappointed with our stay at the Gold Coast  Rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable   when we actually had time to find our bed  Shuttle to the strip   no hassle   great drop off location on strip  What we really enjoyed about staying at the Gold Coast was the table limits  You can play Blackjack for       and don t have to pretend you re some high roller  We will be returning to the Coast Coast  
N =>  Nothing fancy but fine Stayed at the Gold Coast on a super deal of buy one night at     get the next night free and this included weekends  The rooms  had two different ones because my trip was split up  were fine  but a little outdated  The beds were very comfortable and everything was pretty clean even though the carpet was stained  Each room had a little one cup coffee maker which was a bonus  The bathrooms were very small  They had good nightly entertainment in their lounge  Check out was available on the tv  I would definitely stay again if a great deal was available  
N =>  We loved the hotel Our first vist to Las Vegas but certainly not our last  We stayed at the Goldcoast after it was recommended to us by friends who have stayed there several times We throughly enjoyed ourselves and after visiting many of the hotels on the Strip felt far more comfortable at the Goldcoast  We enjoyed a suite on the   th floor  found all of the staff to be friendly and very attentive I agree with other comments that the bathroom tends to be on the samll side  but that is more than made up for by the size of the other rooms We made full use of all the ammenities and would definately recommend the Plaid Tidings show  These guys have wonderful harmony and put on a super show We didn t play the tables but we did find the slots payouts far looser at the Goldcoast than on the Strip Looking forward to our next stay  Special thanks to Michelle K at the front desk  
N => Average We stayed two nights here  The bathroom had a separate sink area from the shower which I like and a big mirror in the room with good lighting for makeup application  The food at the buffet was good but the wine they offer in the coupon book was not good  The price is right for breakfast         and nice choices  Good wait staff  We did get other coupons that we used  Their gift shop is not much  Their liquor area is cheaper than most around the area  No cokes available only Pepsi products  that        for my Rum coke drinks  Coke needs to move into the casinos  All the hotels we were in Pepsi prevailed and that just        Good shuttle service to from strip  Easy to get a cab when we moved over to Flamingo for   free nights  Easy to get around the casino to rooms  Not much play at the slots  Noticed it be considerably tighter this year at all the places we visited  We probably won t be back to this hotel as it was not that impressive but okay if you want to try it out once  
N =>   No Customer Service Horrible Food Small Bathrooms This was our  nd stay at the Gold Coast  The first stay was in a suite and it was fabulous  service  everthing   buffet food was mediocre the first time but everything else was good about a year ago  This trip was horrible  couldn t wait to leave  When we checked in we were given the key to someone else s room  No apologies for this  nothing  I asked to speak to the manager several times during our stay  never available when I went  Casino is very  very smoky  buffet food is horrible  especially breakfast if you can believe it  and employees could care less if you were satisfied  I had another stay booked for ember  I am definitely cancelling it and staying somewhere else  Not worth the aggravation and all else that came with it  Bathroom tiny  sheets weren t changed daily  and very skimpy on toiletries  AVOID and salvage your vacation  
N =>  It s O K  Stayed here         on a     per night rate  I can t complain about the rate but I had requested   doubles non smoking  At   PM on      they had no non smoking rooms left  The smoking room we got did not smell smokey but did show a number of cigarette burns especially in the bathroom  Though I thought the walls were thin from the noise from the rooms I heard in the halls  the rooms themselves were very quite  Biggest problem was on     in the morning  no hot water  I had to take a cold shower  Individual air conditioners are a tad bit noisy but cool well at full blast  I would equate the rooms to that of a Ramada  Howard Johnson  Comfort Inn or Days Inn  If that is acceptable  you ll like this place  It s a very clean     
N =>  Good Value Gold Coast was exaclty what we we were looking for  Clean with a comfortable bed at a reasonable price  Located within walking distance of the strip  Mostly senior citizens stay here but that was Ok with us  Good place to get away from the craziness of the strip  
N =>  Below average We stayed at the Gold coast for   nights in il   having moved from the Luxor  it was never going to measure up  but the Luxor wanted      for the wkd per night We checked in okay  although the check in staff didn t really seem to know what was going on   had to ask loads of questions to get the information that we required  The room was okay   bathroom not big enough to swing a cat in  and noisy trucks outside  We did ask for a room at the end of the corridor  but this didn t make much difference as all room doors bang  so you get woken up whenever someone comes to bed on your floor We ordered room service on  st night   omlettes  and we both got a bad stomach afterwards   so much so that I was unable to go out  We didn t eat anything else in the Gold Coast It s cheap and cheerful   the casinos are quite good  but obviously don t have the attraction of the bigger hotels  Would I stay here again  probably not  
N =>   Great place to stay My wife and I stayed at the gold coast from april   th to the   th and had a wonderful time  Check in was smooth and fast we found the service and the food were great  We really enjoyed the fact that the shuttle to the strip was free and ran all day long  The only problem we found was we did not realize that there was no refridgerater in the room and being diabtic we had to keep the insulin cold with ice  Out side of that we had a great time and would go back ther again 
N =>   Gold dump  I agree with the previous review  quot Gold Dump quot  was the name that we coined  I m not sure what was renovated  maybe the lobbies  but the bathrooms were definitley not  I mean  I should have known that for      you get what you pay for  Went to Casear s the rest of the trip and loved it  
N =>  Everything you need I stayed here for   nights with my girlfriend in        I m amazed that this is only a   star hotel but then again the star rating system doesn t always indicate what you re going to get  The hotel part of this hotel and casino is a block where all the rooms appear to be similar to each other  either with   double or   king size bed  The rooms are functional rather than anything special but we found the bed comfy  The air con was noisy but not bad enough to stop us sleeping We tried several of the food outlets and they were all very good indeed  You certainly won t starve here  and judicious use of the funbooks you get given can cut costs  though nothing is expensive  Funnily enough  I think the gambling subsidises the food and the room costs For those of a gambling nature  the casino is probably at the cheaper and looser end of the scale   more   cent machines and lower limits at the tables  Certainly when we wandered on to the strip  our money seemed to disappear more quickly  Lots of people we talked to said they liked to play in this casino over others  We will definitely gamble here again if when we come back to Vegas though we may try a more upscale hotel if the price is right  If not  back to the Gold Coast is where we ll head  
N =>  Good value  We stayed at the Gold Coast for one night  prior to moving to the Stratosphere  which was booked for the  st night of our stay  The Gold Coast turned out to be great value for money and even though it is not on the Strip  it is only one block back  much  much closer to the action that Stratosphere   There is even a complimentary bus that runs to a sister casino  Barbary Coast  on the Strip  directly opposite Ceasars Palace Good comps  we don t play much so we only ever get what they give us when we check in  and the prices for meals etc were reasonable Room was large and comfortable  and clean    everything you need in Vegas  Would recommend to all  
N =>  Should be called  The Gold DUMP  The best part of the stay was check out   When we checked in after a   hour check in  we made it to our room and much to our surprise we found a vacuum in the middle of the room  Also  the bathroom had what appeared to be a floater in toilet  We called the desk and they said they would send a maid ASAP  A maintenance man showed up with a plunger and worked over the toilet pretty good  We had the buffet for lunch and I felt that it resembled somewhat the same stuff the feed to pigs on the farm back home  But in all  I won      at the BJ table but the slot machines performed nicely and sucked it all back in   hour  Thanks Gold Coast    
N =>  Great Deal Nice  Because of the low price we were expecting that we may be making a mistake  but is sounded great for everyone in our family  especially the bowling alley for the kids  and the pool  etc  We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival when we were upgraded to a suite  and the suite was huge and really made a difference for us  the vacation was a big hit  This was a wonderful value and the hotel was close to my seminar and not far from the strip   it was kind of nice not to stay in the hustle bustle of the strip  alot easier to get around  Highly recommended  
N =>  Pleasantly surprised by the Gold Coast My  quot significant other quot  and I spent three days at the Gold Coast this past ember  and we were pleasantly surprised  Our room was good sized  as was the bathroom area  The sink and vanity area was separate from the bathtub and toilet  which allowed us both to start the morning at the same time  Our room was on the sixth floor  and we were delighted to find that there was a small window in the shower that could be opened  And the entire room was clean  When we checked in  we asked if there was a  quot coupon book quot   and there was  Included were coupons for free drinks in the casino  free ice cream cones at the ice cream shop  and a free souvenir in the gift shop  a deck of cards that had been used in the casino   The casino itself was of a comfortable size  not so large that you could get lost  but large enough that was a variety of slot machines   my only objection was that to get to the slots  you had to walk through the bar area  which was terribly smoky  The restaurants were more than adequate  One morning there was a free continental breakfast because the coffee shop was being remodeled  quite a large spread for a continental breakfast  We used their free shuttle to the Barbary Coast on The Strip  which was quite handy to use when we went exploring  All in all  we had a wonderful time and would definitely stay there again and would recommend it  
N =>  Loved the Gold coast It was our first trip to Las Vegas and we stayed at the Gold Coast We found it to be clean and tidy  but the small bathroom was in need of renovation  The room was clean and of ample size for the   of us We had a hire car and always got parked out front of the hotel We used the shuttle bus to the strip a few times  which was ok We enjoyed the peace and quiet after being on the strip The buffet was brilliant and my son enjoyed chinese for breakfast every morning   lol We played on the slots but not on the tables  as we didnt know how to  but it all looked very well organised The staff were helpful although they struggled with our English Accent  but thats the same anywhere in Nevada and California   All in all a good holiday and we would recommend the GC to anyone planning a trip to LV  
N => Gold Coast or No Show    If we can not stay at the Gold Coast we don t go to Vegas   We are learning to check rooms first and check on airline tickets   Sending friends to the G C  for yhe first time   They will love evrybody there   
N =>  Great value great experience  This was my first trip to Vegas  I thought the Gold Coast was a GREAT value for what we paid  and very close to the strip to experience it all without the high cost of a strip hotel  we had a rental car  The casino was really nice    a good  not too cluttered layout that was easy to navigate yet still had a lot to offer  The rooms were very decent  and had the most comfortable bed ever As others have said  the bathroom was a little small  one room with the toilet  shower  and no room for anything else  and the sink just outside that door in an alcove   but that was my only complaint    the rest of the experience there was awesome  Friendly staff  everything was very clean  good buffet  nice live entertainment  music  every night  a decent selection of TV stations in the room  somewhat of an oddity in Vegas  I ve been told   parking always available very close to the door in the ramp    overall a great place  Would absolutely stay there again  
N => cockroach in room Stayed at the Gold Coast for   nights around Christmas Place was small compared to most in vegas  rooms were clean and nice and the bathrooms weren t as small as I heard they would be Food was just ok  gaming also just ok  but no problems with noise at night or staff  Nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of the strip area Unfortunately  we did find a coackroach in our room on our third night there After talking to six people  half a day wasted and being so upset that I couldn t even deal with the staff any more  they gave us a free upgrade to a suite and gave us free dinner and breakfast  Very nice of them but I would of preferred not to of had a cockroach in my room  getting upset and wasting my time We weren t looking for freebies we just wanted our room sprayed and for them to pay to launder my belongings but the refused  I was even more upset about bringing home these little buggers in my luggage but they didn t care how upset I was about this This sure put a damper on our trip  Would we stay there again NO  
N =>  Super hotel for those on a budget  I found this hotel to be a great find  Very close to the strip  The trendy Palms  amp  Rio hotels right next door  Free shuttle to other Coast owned hotels  amp  one of them is right on the strip  Room was super clean  amp  newly renovated w  nice decor  Bathroom could ve been a little bigger  Small pool  Elevator s slow  amp  often crowded  but looks like they were doing a renovation on their elevators so that s probably why the problems  Wonderful buffet with a huge selection  amp  great prices  Lots of fun slot machines without being too noisy like some casinos  If you re looking for a hip party vibe then this hotel is not for you  If you re on a budget and want to enjoy all Vegas has to offer then this is a great place to stay at a great price  Next time I want to check out their Bowling Center  Will definitely stay here again  Helped make my  st trip to Vegas a memorable one  
N =>  NEW POKER ROOM     This was our  nd trip to Vegas  The first one we stayed at Bally s but spent most of our time at the Gold Coast  The dealers  amp  staff were friendly here unlike the casinos on the strip  I was skeptical of the     night rate  amp  thought maybe the rooms were not as good  I was pleasantly surprised to find that our non smoking room was beautiful  At Bally s we paid more than      night for a bathrrom with tiles off the walls and stained carpet  The Gold Coast had a newly renovated modern bathroom with a separate sink area  The beds were comfortable  amp  the room was immaculate  We were in a room at the end of the hallway but that made it that much quieter that rooms by the elevator  I watched my husband play Texas Hold em for   hours before the dealers convinced me to try  I was scared to play   After   hours of straight play I walked away a winner  I really apreciated the dealers showing me how to play  They are truly assets to this business I strongly recommend this hotel  amp  casino to anyone visiting Vegas  
N =>  Would not go back  My girlfriends and I have been going to Vegas since the early      s and we decided to give this place a trial since it was a good price  We went in ober       The biggest problem was the shuttle  It doesn t get started until      am so that leaves you little time to get started on your day  We then got tired of waiting for the shuttle so walked over to Rio which is quite a jaunt  We for the first time in all the years we have been there  suffered terrible rainy weather  Therefore we had to stand at least    minutes each time waiting for the shuttle and for the most part  it was raining and miserable and it was usually packed on the shuttle  The table games were limited   they did not even have   card poker which is very popular right now  They also had no Let it Ride card games  They present you with a Gold coast Card which promises many comps  etc  when actually you get nothing  We got nothing for the hours of gambling we did there  When we checked out  we were told that we should have got a black table card  The rooms were okay  we spend little time in our rooms but I have to say the bathroom was dinky  The good thing was the restaurants were good in the hotel  I would definitely not come back to this hotel  There is way too much competition in Vegas and they could have done a lot better  
N =>  Simple Hotel Casino  Good value Good value off strip hotel next to Rio and Palms very  very convenient free shuttle to Barbary Coast Hotel  across from Bellagio  Caesar s and Bally s  Cheap good food  nice rooms  small bathrooms but how much time do you spend in the tub  Friendly helpful staff  good parking  
N =>  Great Place for the Money We stayed at the GC in il       It was our first time in Vegas as after seeing the strip I believe we chose wisely  I chose this place based on so many positive reviews and we were not sorry  Room was very quiet and clean including bathroom  Although small it had great water pressure and hot water  The bed was the most comfortable I have ever found in a motel  We enjoyed the casino  didn t treat us too badly   We ate at Terrible Mike s several times   food was good and cheap  We really enjoyed the bingo hall   treated me very well  The pool area was very nice they have a great hot tub  We will return to the GC on our next trip to vegas  
N =>  Expecting more After reading all the reviews here  I decided to book my   nights  from            in Vegas at the Gold Coast  This was my first time in Vegas but in my opinion I think we could have gotten something better elsewhere for the same money  To start with the hotel is not in the Strip  we knew that  so if you don t have a car  and I don t recommend driving in Vegas  traffic is crazy    you have to take the free shuttles that go from Gold Coast to the Barbary Coast Hotel in the Strip  across street from Bellagio   These shuttle should run every    min   that s what the ppl in front desk say  but you could easy stand for more than    min  waiting for the shuttle to arrive The room was dark  furniture is old  the bathroom was really tiny  almost European standard  with no air circulation and it didn t look too clean  the air conditioner was noisy and even so in the middle of the summer  around     degrees outside  the room never got really cool off  The front desk staff where not the most helpful ppl you could find    in the other hand the bell boys were very kind and willing to help  The pool is really small  I think some Best Westerns have bigger pools The casino was ok  good slots machines   Again  I am not sure how the other hotels around the same price are in Las Vegas but in my next trip to Vegas I will definetly not stay here  
N => Gold Coast Rocks  Totally love the Gold Coast  Not the big fancy hotels but well worth the money  First booked about   years ago when checking out room rates  Sold on the bowling  With four teens  sons brothers  and free shuttle was worth it  And have been going every year  Recommend to my hs teams who are in tournaments and friends and family  Buffet very reasonable since changed to station format but food was not bad before  Love the after midnight bowling for    a game but sometimes the attendant can be testy   has to deal with teens but make sure yours are over    and have ID  That will help  Love the shuttle and try the Orleans buffet too  The rooms are nice for the money  Pool could be bigger but still a good deal overall  
N =>  A great place to stay  Myself and my    year old son stayed at the Gold Coast in il of this year and were very pleased  The room was clean and easy to get to from the casino  Breakfast buffet was very good and a good value at        The bowling alley was a great thing to do on a slow evening    No partying with a    year old   The hotel is easy to get to and parking is plentiful and close  The slots have ticket in tickets out  which I thought was great  I tend to be a  quot machine hopper quot  and it was easy to cash out and try a new machine  Lots of video poker in small denominations which I like  Also lots of penny slots for us budget minded people  I have also stayed at Circus Circus and Excalibur in the past but Gold Coast is my favorite so far  Going back in y with my brother and wanted to do so cheaply so am going to try Westward Ho  Reviews are mixed so will be interested to see for myself  If it doesn t work  Gold Coast will be tops   
N =>  nfr   star normally stay downtown at the nuggett howeverthis place is great  Rooms were much better than expected  service was super everyone friendly and helpful  Steak house was superb  did not come out a winner but thats more my fault  The dealers are so nice  I just keep sitting there giving it all back We had a party of about    and they will not stay anywhere else this year during the rodeo  
N => Can t beat the price    The Gold Coast was a perfect place to stay  The shuttle service provided easy access to the strip  The room was perfect for us as we didn t need anything more than a place to sleep  It was clean and comfortable The service on check in was kind and courteous  I would not hesitate to stay at the Gold Coast on my next trip to Las Vegas  
N =>  excellent  st visit to vegas My husband and I stayed at he Gold Coast from       ch      it was our first visit to Vegas and it was very enjoyable  Yes the hotel did have a few locals in it but that to us was a good indication  My main worry before we arrived was that I had read there was no safetydepost box in the room   that turned out not to be a problem you just go to the cashiers desk and they give you a box behind their counter and incidentally is free which was a shock compared to the prices you have to pay in european hotels  The staff in all every part of the hotel were very polite nothing was too much trouble to them  We intend to return to Vegas again and we will certainly look at the Gold Coast again  
N =>  Great value  We stayed at the Gold Coast after staying on the strip  great value  clean rooms  good buffet  The pool was small  but not too crowed  Enjoyed the off strip location  but could take the shuttle to the Barbary Coast if you wanted  
N => What a Dump This place was a DUMP  there was maggott infested food in the hallways   The help was very poor nobody spoke english     The pool was green with some kind of funk going on    we are going down again in may and we are going to stay at the imperial palace 
N =>  Exactly What We Wanted After reading whatever we could find from travel guides to comments from other travelers  we chose the Gold Coast for our recent stay in Vegas            It was everything we were looking for in a hotel  check in was quick  our rooms were clean  spacious and we had a partial view of the strip  we were on the  th floor   the rooms were very quiet  the bed was really comfortable  and the price was quite a bit less than most other hotels  Parking was a breeze   we parked on the upper level of the parking ramp and walked right into the hotel in just a few steps  The hotel itself was very clean  and it was easy to find things  The staff was nice and helpful  especially Mimo  the Bell Captain  The breakfast buffet was fabulous          and our dinner on Valentine s Day evening in the Cortez Room was delicious  the service excellent and the price for   adults eating lobster  prime rib and orange roughy  with wine and desserts  was just under       It was easy to find the slot machines we wanted  or a    blackjack table  After seeing the sights  and fighting the traffic  on the strip  it was nice to come back to this hotel at night  
N =>  great beds we stayed in november  We had great service  The beds are great  They are made of foam not an interspring  If you like select comfort beds or a water bed you will love this  plus free CHILD CARE  
N =>  The Gold Coast was cool     I was impressed   very clean  staff friendly  buffet not bad   some slots paid very well  The room was definitely large enough and clean  We will stay there again  
N => Terrible walls Terrible walls between rooms  I can even heard the last room on the hall ways making noises  cheap cheap cheap 
N =>  Very enjoyable We enjoyed our   nights there and found it very comfortable  Very clean and newly redecorated  Easy access to dining rooms  amp  coffee shop  Off the strip  not so much hustle and bustle as some of the larger hotels  The staff was very accommodating in every aspect of our stay  Easy access to strip via shuttle every    min  Valet parking was wonderful and quick in and out  Easy access to taxi and other forms of transportation  
N =>  Gold Coast                Negatives   Bathrooms were very small   Slots seemed to be tight    Need to drive to anywhere else    Beds were soft I like a firm bed  Positives   Free Child Care   Drinks were coming real fast with a    tip    Buffet was good    Check in was fast    Gift shop had good prices on alcohol    Free gym Overall the experience was better than average  Paid about    bucks a night The key to the whole deal was that we had the kids with us and the free child care made the whole experience dirt cheap  Most places don t have child care and others charge     an hour  For   Kids at   hours that would be     a day so that makes the room price dirt cheap I would say that if you are taking the Children then stay here for sure        If you don t have Kids along  then stay somewhere else  
N =>  Just Great   Just came back from our US trip  Stayed for   nights in Las Vegas  i e  the Gold Coast Hotel  amp  Casino  It was just great  Good service  clean  good food  good entertainment  Not such a mass product as many other accomodations on the Strip  Great value for a reasonable price  
N =>  Great Rooms ho hum food  
N => not impressed  
N =>  Gold Coast was nice  
N => Outstanding Service    
N =>   G nstiges Hotel in  Stripn he   
N =>   No muy formales   
N =>  Avoid Rita the Pit Boss at all costs A friend has a blogsite and also writes for CasinoGuide in Las Vegas  He was impressed with Gold Spike and the upgrades and suggested we all go there for a night of fun on Friday  e   th  Not only did he okay our large group of       people but verified it THREE times with management We showed up in two limos at approximately   p m  Friday night  Mind you  we are a fun group  tip to excess  and laugh our butts off even while losing  One pit boss RITA found our group to be a little too overwhelming  She went as far as to repirimand our tour guide for not giving HER a heads up that we would show up  In addition  she told one gentleman in our group that she would not have her cocktail waitresses  quot disrespected quot   If tipping them     per round and making them laugh their butts off is  quot disrespecting quot   RITA has more issues than just being a dried up old woman It seemed to be common knowledge among the other employees that RITA was a liability and ruining what should have been a very profitable night for them  She actually closed the blackjack pit at midnight    I thought I was back in Central City  Colorado In closing let me say ALL other employees were great  Peter  one of the other pitbosses   Jamie  a dealer   and everyone else  I will be writing a letter to the owner management at the Gold Spike regarding RITA s assinine behaviour  In this economy  employees like her are worthless andn a huge liability to aany company Karen from Denver 
N =>   NOT EVEN IF ITS FREE if you dont mind MOLD and FILTY AMOSTPHER this was the worst hotel ever there was MOLD on the walls by the bed and MOLD on the ceiling and in the bathrooms the floors was filty never mopped and called to have room service to clean what a joke the tub lift the tub matt surprize MOLD again then when you see the bedroom you cant even walk on the carpet from taking a bath it was so dirty visit room     for yourself no picture wish i did but i didnt want to waste my time its that bad i changed rooms before this   time they was the same but smelly really funky 
N =>  Good hotel  Good hotel for the money   close to Freemont and the bus stop  Hotel was well lit on the inside  My non smoking room had no trace of smoke smell in it  The restaurant was great   closed a little early but that was okay  The front desk staff was friendly  My only complaint was that there were no aminities   such as extra toothbrushes  toothpaste or shuttle service to the airport  They also didn t have any complimentary wireless internet  Overall the hotel was good  I will stay there again when I come back to Vegas   unless I strike it rich  This hotel is perfect for someone who is in Vegas on a budget    
N =>   Worst hotel I have ever stayed in I am very suprised that Expedia list this hotel as it is appalling I arrived at  pm  check in was from  pm  but was told my room was not ready  I asked if there was anywhere to leave my luggage while I went for a drink and waited  I was told there was no where  So I was left standing in the grottiest casino in town surrounded by the dead beats in the casino  I asked again after    mins and the unhelpful  unsmiling desk guy said he would give me another room  I eventually went up to it and to be fair for what it cost it was ok  I opened the curtains to see the back of   airconditioning units and several filters that had been left on the roof I kept the curtains closed for the rest of my stay  There was a TV but no remote control Everytime I went out or came back I had to walk through the horrible dirty casino  It was always full of dodgy looking low life  The hotel is only   block from Fremont Street which is why I chose it but beware there are many homeless bums in this area When I checked out I asked them to phone a cab for me but suprise suprise it never arrived  I don t think they ever rang one  I walked round the corner  amp  hailed my own cab One night I did have a bit of fun splatting a huge cockroach on the wall of my room with my shoe  I left it there for them to clean up but they never bothered Take my advice there are plenty more cheap hotels in town that are better than this one  Give it a miss  
N =>   Not great It took    minutes of waiting in line before we checked in  there were   people ahead of us  The man at the desk was a little off  like he was hallucinating  Once we got to the elevator it took    minutes to get in it  The hallways were very dark and musty  not really dirty with trash everywhere  but more like they hadn t been cleaned in several years  just picked up garbage here and there  Wallpaper was coming off walls  There was a ketchup stain on the bed comforter  The lighting in the room was also pretty dim  The windows were small and ours looked out onto the parking lot so we could see our truck  The whole atmosphere smelled like cigarettes and coffee  I guess I shouldn t have expected more from downtown Vegas  We chose this place over the strip because we had never stayed downtown before  I don t know if I ever will again  but definitely not at this hotel  
N =>   Awful The reservations were not right  they would not cooperate with us  We booked   rooms for a wedding that weekend  Personnel were extremely rude  
N =>  Looks can be decieving  When we first arrived me where like  quot Oh no  quot  The front desk clerk was slow and really weird  After checking in finally  we went to our hotel room and it was what we expected  If you ve stayed in a Motel    its just like that  The room was clean and the bed weren t hard as a brick  It was a bit worn down but good for what we needed  You can t beat     a night for Friday and Sat   The only downfall is the hotel doesn t have cable and we ony had   channels  I thought this was going to be a problem for me but it wasn t since we where barely in our room  I honestly would have liked cable since I might have stayed in the room more and not lost so much money gambling  All in all  it was a great place to crash and take a shower  I would stay again just for the price  Don t expect a riott but if you re OK with a Motel   type of place with no cable TV   this is the place for you     
N =>  A Horror Story Our experience  my and I  was so terrible that I had to share it with everyone  We just returned home from our trip three days ago  We were set up by some bootleg travel agency World Wide Travel Center  with this hotel  We entered a casino with smoke so thick that your hand could cut right through it not to mention that it even seeped up into the spaces where they called rooms  It was small  filthy  smelly  and had clogged drains  which no one came to fix after we requested this  I had to hold on to my husband for the prostitutes cracheads looked as if they were ready to attack at any minute  We too inquired about the free breakfast  but it didn t matter cause we made up our minds not to eat here  Boy were we lucky  The old guy at the desk shirt was dirty and he had apersonality to match  I read the reviews before going  but I did not think it was possible for it to be this bad  Unfortunately when we returned in late that night we were greeted by buddies big     crickets  amp roaches  that were waiting for us on the wall  This was when my husband could take more and checked us out and found another hotel who prices also were not bad but was clean  fun  and we had a wonderful stay Golden Gate on Freemont Street  I m glad someone finally posted pictures of what the dump really looks like  Why is there even a pool rating  cause they don t have one  People when the shuttle bus driver is feeling nervous about dropping you off here something is wrong  I dont understand how anyone on a budget or not could take this risk  
N =>  at your own risk Where shall I begin  I guess I will start from the beggining We stayed e    and e   th       What a dump  We didn t read reviews until AFTER our stay  huge mistake  although we did look on their website  After we parked in their lot we were very skeptical  The lot had questionable people lurking about  We checked on our car several times a day to make sure it was still there and undamaged  nothing happened   I was approached but a guy in front of the building asking for money  From that point on my husband insisted on always being with me  We went to check in  and we didn t have to wait  probably because they had very few customers   They were friendly at the front desk  and had no problem with check in or out  It was a good thing that we didn t stay in the room long because they had only   channels on the T V  When we were in the room most of the channels were news  Unlike some guests we did have plenty of hot water  but we had to stand in a couple inches of water while we took showers  However we were not told how to get to our room  nor when check in or check out was  The room smelled moldy  and could have used a good cleaning  We seen on their website that they offered a free breakfast  so we figured that that might make up a little for how bad the room and hotel was  so we returned to the front desk to ask about the free meal only to be told that they discontinued the free meal  I told them about reading this on their website and she told me she knew it was on their website  but that there wasn t anything she could do  The next day we decided to try their cafe  I soon understood why they discontinued the free meal because it must have been running off business  We seen   employees walking around and eating while they were working  They were not attentive to the customers at all  We ordered hamburgers  fries  and salad  The salad sat on the counter  and we had to ask them for it upon getting our burgers  The salad had flies all around it so it wasn t edible  at least not for me   My husband liked the greasy burger  but I couldn t stomach it  Credit or debit cards are not accepted  but then again they were probably afraid we would stop the payment once we tried to eat their food  And if all this wasn t enough they had a systems check at  am  Someone got on the intercom to tell everyone that they were conducting a test on their fire alarm  It started blaring  and scared the heck out of us when the loud speaker came on  The sirens and the announcement went continuance for an hour  They kept saying it was only a test  and to ignore it  After an hour they said that concluded their test  About    minutes later the siren went off again ths time no one came on to let us know if it was real or not  so we just stayed in our room  The longer we stayed at this dive the madder we became  Other then these listed it was a good hotel  yeah right   If you stay at the place your jeopardizing your health and your sanity  
N => Truly horrible There were BUGS IN MY BED  Unfortunately  I am allergic to insect bites  and this spoiled my whole vacation  of which Las Vegas was the first stop  I had booked and paid for the room on the Southwest website  so I could not get a refund  The man at the front desk was apologetic  but did not look very surprised   and offered to move me to another room  But the overall look of the place made me doubt if they had any rooms without bugs  The carpets were dirty  the room smelled really bad  and the air conditioner was incredibly noisy  A truly disgusting place  I checked out in the middle of the night and moved to Golden Nugget a few blocks away  
N => More like the Old Stinky Dangerous Ghetto Spike We booked this room becuase of the web site adversited and that the rates for what the rooms were described where resonable for someone booking online  We arrived to the location and from the moment we were driving in the parking lot I felt like I was in Dowtown Los Angeles  We were surrounded by homeless people who looked like they were on drugs  We hurried up into the hotel to check in as we taught it be safer  That was not the case  The hotel was dark and gloomy like the walls had gone BLACK from so much cigarette smoke  I could literally not breathe  The people in the Casino also looked like mostly old drunks or homeless or both  I hurried to get my friends to stop them from checking in  but we were obligated to pay the night since we had booked it on line  WE DID NOT STAY  We decided it was just NOT SAFE  Our first loss in Vegas but you could not have paid me enough to stay there for the night  But after reading a few reviews of how cheap the rooms where for only         On line we were charged         a night  
N =>  Not too Shabby  My boyfriend and I are in our    s and don t make a whole lot of money  yet   We came to Las Vegas to spend time with each other and see the sites  not to stay at a five star luxurious resort  Gold Spike is reasonably priced  so I see no reason for people to complain  You get what you pay for  And the rooms were not bad at all  They might be a little old and worn  but not everything can be brand new forever  For what we paid  we couldn t have expected better  And we would stay there again  too  Even when we re older and make much more money  we will stay at Gold Spike because of all the fun memories we had on our first trip to Vegas  If it weren t for inexpensive hotels such as this one  people like us who make minimum wage wouldn t be able to travel around and see the world until we re elderly  Thank God for this hotel  
N => Not bad for    Bucks I stayed in Gold Spike hotel with my family on    rd for   nite  I was on a long trip from LA  SF  San deigo  Vegas  Grand Canyon and had blown up all the money  I was looking for a cheaper room for the last day of my trip and On Strip hotels were very expensive it being a weekend  Though i d booked this hotel but was li l concerned about the safety  amp  other aspects after reading couple of nasty reviews  I took a chance a stayed there  The exterior  amp  casino place was really shady and took me almost    mins to complete the check in process  But after that the stay was pretty comfortable   I didn t have to go back in the casino so it was ok  Room was clean with two comfortable queen beds  Clean bathroom  Breakfast was really good and complimentary  It was dirt cheap even if one has to pay for it         Overall it wasn t a bad experience as i originally thought especially with the price i paid for it 
N =>  Dirtiest Hotel Room Ever  Stayed here based on the recommendation of the  quot Cheapo Vegas quot  people  What a mistake  The room was filthy  The toilet was not clean  the shower clogged and was dirty from previous guests  The bed sheets had not been washed and were dirty  The rude front desk staff said no other rooms were available  Never again  The cheap room rates are not worth it  next time I will spend more money and stay at cleaner hotel  
N =>  WHAT A BARGAIN    if you are planning to go to vegas this is the place to stay we had a great clean room the front desk clerk was so sweet i believe his name was robert he took the time to call us when a room was ready    min earlier than check in time it is a   min walk to the light show and great bargains for souveniers what more could you ask for    our next trip will include the golden spike hotel  
N =>  Not THAT bad The Gold Spike is not a top class hotel  However  when I stayed there in ch       my room was comfortable  the service was O K  I agree the casino is smokey   which one isn t For what I paid per night  I could not really complain P W  United Kingdom  
N => Don t Do It We went here on our first trip to Vegas  anniversary  last week  I never went barefoot in the place  but we did have our room cleaned daily  When I got home I had to wash EVERYTHING  including our bags  It all stunk  I guess you get what you pay for The biggest drawback to this location is that when my husband wanted to nap  I had nowhere to go  He didn t feel safe enough for me to go out alone  even in the daytime  I should have brought more to read  The next time we go  we will stay closer to the actual strip  This was no where near walking distance to the main action  
N => Great for Doing Vegas on the Cheap I stayed at the Gold Spike in il       If you plan to spend your trip outside of your hotel room and just need a clean place to sleep for a good price  you can t beat the Gold Spike  Access is super convenient from the freeways  you can walk   minutes to the Freemont Street Experience if you like to gamble downtown  which I do   you can also hop on the freeway and get to the Strip in   minutes  Our room was clean and even though we had a smoking room  we were able to open our window on the  th floor and keep the room well ventilated  The shower water pressure was great  The gentleman at the front desk was pleasant and friendly  we were able to get extra towels when requested  and we had a great time  It s not the Ritz  the carpet could use replacing and the casino was smoky and contained some less than savory characters  but why pay      for a beautiful clean room if you are going to spend your vacation seeing the sights  Save your money and buy a Cirque ticket instead  
N =>  Give me a break  We stayed at this casino hotel on ch    amp     I must admit that based on the ratings I read I was questioning my decision to stay here despite the excellent price      for Sat  and     for Sun   right up until the day before we left  Because I couldn t find prices anywhere near this  for a weekend  and I knew we d only be sleeping here spending most of our time on the main strip  I decided to go with it  Upon check in what was in the reviews I read was true dark  rundown  very smokey and again I question my decision before finally making my way to the check in counter  located at the back   We were greeted by a very nice guy named Jeff  It was       check in is at       and our room wasn t ready yet  He said about    min  so we decided to try the restaurant and their       jumbo hotdog and soda  The restaurant was a bit scary  rundown and had some locals seated in it  and we questioned the bargain we were about to consume  As it turned out it was a great bargain and while we were seated there were four workers from the casino that walked by  looked down at us  smiled and said hi  This made us feel welcomed and put us at ease a bit  After eating we went to check in again and our room still wasn t ready we had to wait another    minutes  During this time Jeff  the desk attendant  took the time to tell us all about Vegas and some of the hot spots to go  He was very pleasant to talk to he also gave us a coupon for a free breakfast for having to wait so long  Once we were able to go up to our room  on the third  non smoking floor  we were pleasantly surprised  It was more than we expected  very clean and nice  Nothing like what we had read about on this site  In our opinion  and we have traveled the world staying in hostels and in very expensive places  for the price you cannot beat this place  quiet  clean and comfortable   Again we used this only for sleeping  spending all of our time on the main strip  Also upon check in Jeff gave us a slip of paper to put into the car so that the security guards outside would know that we were staying there  I think if you let your mind play games with you and relate this casino and location to what you see in the movies you may be somewhat afraid to stay go here  However  we did not find this to be the case  It is our opinion to give it a try  
N =>  Gold Spike    smoky and dirty We stayed in a room at the Gold Spike while my boyfriend attended NAB last year   il       I was initially intending to come when it was over but I actually got a cheaper ticket from Canada coming at the same time as him  We had a shuttle from the airport and there was only a few of us going to downtown  When we got to the hotel entrance I thought it looked pretty depressing and when we went to the checkout desk we were greeted by a clerk missing some front teeth  During the check in  which took some time  the smoke was so thick you could cut it with a knife  When we got up to the room and opened the door it initially didn t look bad but the carpet was so dirty I couldn t believe it  it was a dark carpet and it had big dark stains all over it  We had to get help from the front desk to air our no smoking room out because the smell of smoke    either from the other rooms or previous smokers was strong  Every night we put a wet towel under the front door to block out any smoke coming in and I never let my bare feet touch the floor  The beds and linen appeared to be clean and the beds were comfortable  The tv worked  the parking was free  the bathroom was clean and the maid was nice and gave us clean towels every day  Would I stay here again     NO   My boyfriend on the other hand really probably wasn t that bothered and that s why I booked him there initially After that we left and went to the Grand Canyon and that was spectacular  
N =>  Unexpectedly Filthy I ve been to the Gold Spike casino before so I had pretty low expectations about the hotel  I expected the room to be old and theadbare  and that would have been fine  However  I did not expect the filth  The air in the room was so smoky that it was almost unbreathable  The carpet had not been vaccuumed and was covered with stains  I tried to avoid stepping on it with my bare feet  The toilet seat was literally smeared with feces  It was vile  I m not some prissy girl  but I was pretty grossed out by the cleanliness of the room  
N =>  What a place  After leaving the Hilton to stay at the Gold Spike  it was quite a shock  I lovingly referred to it as the  quot ghetto quot   After entering the building and not seeing the  quot front desk quot   I finally inquired and found it  The person at the desk was very friendly  My husband and I checked in and took the elevator to the third floor  It seemed OK once we got off the elevator  It looked nice till we got into our room  Small  dark  and smelled strongly of reeze or something similar  It was close to Fremont Experience and a place with    theaters  That was nice  The other thing I didn t like was there was a knock on our door in the middle of the night  but luckily nothing happened from that  We ate breakfast before leaving which was good  but not great  You had to order your own and pick it up when ready  Different  but I felt lucky to be leaving the next day alive   
N =>  Not too shabby  We stayed at the Gold Spike il      to attend the Viva Las Vegas   Rockabilly weekend  The room was clean and what I would consider adequate  The price was great and the location was good  There was easy access to the freeway and to Las Vegas Blvd  strip   The diner left just a bit to be desired as far as the service goes  but the food was good and reasonably priced  For staying at the hotel  you automatically get entered into the drawings they have twice daily  and each day you are there you get either a free breakfast coupon or a  buy one get one free  meal ticket  Didn t have a problem with the neighborhood it was in  felt perfectly safe walking in from the parking lot in the middle of the night  Would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Vegas  Not the Ritz  but definitely a decent place to rest your weary body  
N =>  What an awful place This was my second time in Vegas and was visiting to get married  Since we are older and the second time for both of us getting married we decided to sleep cheap and spend our money on touring  I just want to let others know to not do what we did   upgrade a bit  It was terrible  The first morning we decided to eat our  quot free quot  breakfast at the hotel  We had to clean our own table  Out of all the tables we picked the cleanest one we could find and it was not clean  Food was OK  Our room was filthy  the carpet was more dirty than clean  I would never have walked on it barefoot  The air did not work very well  by the time we left   after   days   our room was starting to cool off  The bathroom drain was open and the water backed up in it and filled the bottom of the bath tub  I was never comfortable to leave the room and go to gamble myself  The casino  restaurant  and bar were continually filled with a transient population  It was very dark and smelly  On the last night we were there I picked up my pillow and crickets jumped out of my pillow case  My suggestion would be to find another place to stay this one needs to be leveled  The highlight of the place is the desk staff  They are helpful and seem overworked but very nice  
N => Absolutely Disgusting   
N =>  Good Stay  
N => This Place Sux  
N =>  Good room   Legal Cheating by the Casino  
N => well worth the price  
N =>  This place rocks     
N =>   Le motel le plus connu et le moins cher du downtown    
N => Grandview needs to get it s act together Just returned from this place two days ago  This was a nice place to stay and I have no complaints about the accomodations  But I was very disappointed in the staff  They screwed up at ever turn  I arrived late in the evening while some of my family checked in earlier in the day  The hotel staff harassed my mother several times that evening before she showed up at the desk with her credit card to  quot calm quot  the front desk staff down   Reservation was in my name  but I had called to get them permission to check in early  I arrived at      pm and gave them my credit card to settle all issues  next day at about       at night as we returned from an evening out they had locked us out of our room  not one key worked  When we called down to front desk they said it is because we hadn t paid our bill  I explained the situation of my flight delay and paying at      pm the night before etc  They had no record of my credit card  What a nightmare  When I went down stairs to resolve this they had charged my mothers credit card  And yet they still locked us out  A note attached to the account stated  quot Do not charge this credit card but to wait for me to show up with my credit card quot   They reversed the charges and were embarrassed about all these problems they had caused  And perplexed at what had happened  The left hand definitely didn t know what the right hand was doing  Some of the rooms were missing soap  some were missing shampoo  when calling to get what we needed they gave us the run around  and never delivered the soap or shampoo  Customer service is lacking BIG TIME gt  BE CAREFUL  I can t wait to see my final bill  I am sure it will be screwed up too  
N => I would recommend this resort for its spacious accommodations and decor  The beginning of the visit was frustrating because of the lack of coordination between the resort and RCI  neither would assume responsibilty for not having us on the registration list even though calls had been made to both agencies   weeks before    days before  and the day of  After about an hour  I was finally in a room where I took an immediate nap  only to wake to red  itchy   swollen eyes  and a familiar animal smell  Definite animal dander had been left behind  The housekeeping manager handled this graciously by offering to move me to a different room with no garantees  even though animals are not allowed   but we settled with having the carpet shampooed and all of the linen and comforter replaced  By the way  a guest later entered the elevator with a dog  If you have allergies to pet dander  beware and ask for safety cleaning  This worked very well  The       charge for coffee was ridiculous and was waived once protested  Very nice deli on site  The food was good  Shuttle service was very good   timely and considerate  Be prepared to tip  The resort shuttle activities were very good and allowed freedom of movement without the    regular shuttle service  Even though the overall resort experience was good  more effort toward friendliness could have been exemplified by the front end staff   they were a bit aloof and not as involved with guest services and care as I have experienced in other resorts  
N =>  Time away from the reality of Work and Kids We didn t rent a vehicle  we rode the deuce and shuttled around town  The room was clean and well kept  The pool area is beautiful  but be prepared  even us Canadians found it freezing  not heated  The free internet to book flights was great  Felt very safe on the grounds  Did not get hounded for timeshare speeches  we didn t go to one and they asked us once and then left us alone  This was greatly appreciated Negative  they left us a message at   am  we were already out for the day  when we returned at midnight  they had locked us out of our room because we had not returned their call regarding the        safe fee  When we didnt have proper id  they had security escort us to our room to open the safe to get our passports for i d  WOW  I was less than impressed and will NEVER stay there again for this event alone  They have no idea how to treat a guest   
N =>  wonderful place but you need a car  We just returned from a week at Grandview  It was very good and clean  the first unit was shabby and the carpet was stained  one of the faucets was broken  but we were moved immediately when we complained  the facilities are very good  pools  gym and BBQ    Having Southpoint next door is a plus as they have lots of restaurants  movies  bowling etc  and  of course  a casino  the furniture is not very comfortable to sit in  but  who in Vegas sits   Wonderful vacation  
N =>   It was just great for us We knew going down this would be a time share and we d get at least a quick push from the staff on how great it was to be an owner  We did have that happen  but it was over after only a few seconds when we said we were not interested  The room was great for us  The price was outstanding  It was about a    minute drive to the shows on the strip  but we didn t mind that at all  Ton s of space  We didn t run into any sound problems with other rooms  Two minor complaints  The leaf blower guy at   am     really are they serious  The pool was so cold  Perhaps when the temp outside it       the cold pool is great  but we were there when the temp was in the    s and the pool was too cold  Recommend the breakfast at the casino next door  Internet came at a cost  
N =>   Good family environment for Vegas We got a great deal on the Grandview not realizing it was a timeshare  We loved the location next to South Pointe and the fact it was off the strip so we didn t have to explain inappropriate behavior to our kids like we often do when we have to stay on the strip  We stayed in the Sage building  The chairs were dirty  stained   the parking during the day was limited  but fine at night  the walls were thin  They have a restaurant onsite which would ve been great but the grill or fryer was broken and we couldn t order  but South Pointe had several restarurants to choose from  The pools were great  We felt like we had a lot of space in the room for the price and we loved the jacuzzi tub  
N =>   Best value in Vegas We booked through the  quot resort quot  portion and skipped the whole timeshare thing  We stayed in Lily and really were impressed by the rooms  Having   rooms that were adjoining was perfect and thought the layout was terrific  Its a bit confusing when you book   there are no  quot   room quot  condos   you have to book   separate rooms and hope that when you check in there are adjoining rooms  So if you have a family with small children   check in as soon as you can so that you can secure adjoining rooms  The front staff was wonderful in helping us secure our rooms  especially at  p on a Friday night when its seemingly chaotic with everyone checking in  My kids loved the pool  I thought the exercise room was great and the distance to the strip was exactly what we wanted  There was a free shuttle to M   the newest casino  You definitely need a car  The rooms were quieter than a Holiday Inn  no  quot smoking quot  smells once you re in your room  THe plumbing very loud   especially the jetted tub  but it was bothersome once over the entire weekend  Overall  we would definitely stay here again  
N =>   Nice Place to Stay with the Family Staying here  you definitely need a car  However  there is still a lot to do close by  The South Point Casino is right next door  and besides the typically gambling  they have a movie theater  bowling alley  arcade room  and much more The pools during our stay were pretty cold  but they were having a mild Spring  so we were told   Most of the time was spent in the hot tubs  which were really too hot to spend much time  so I d say the pools were just average  Rooms were nice  new  and clean  Would have been nice to have free wifi  but you don t  so you need to go to the lobby to wait for your chance at    minutes  Not convenient  but better than nothing  The highway is easily accessible from the resort  so we hopped on that most times to get where we needed to go I think you ll enjoy your stay here  We would definitely go back again  
N =>  Very Nice and Convenient Location The location is on the Las Vegas strip  but to the south  easy to get to and conveniently located to many offerings in Vegas  such as shopping centers  restaurants  etc  The unit we stayed in had a full kitchen and comfortable furniture  The decor is stylish and relaxing  The parking was not great on weekends  we had to park in a parking structure near the building  but a decent walk late at night to the hotel  The area felt safe though  The GrandView does not offer free wireless in the room  which was disappointing  We paid     for the week we were there and the speeds were pretty slow  usually around  mb  They do offer guests to use their computers in the main office building  but we like to lounge around in our pajamas late at night or in the morning  and it just was the same  The pools were nice  though it was cool cold when we were there  so we didn t take advantage of them  We rarely heard any other guests  and found the stay relaxing and comfortable  
N =>   Great Resort in a Great Location We have just returned from   weeks at this resort as an RCI Timeshare exchange and were very pleased with our stay  We had really bad colds the first week so weren t able to make the most of the resort facilities  bit we did make use of one of the hot tubs in the second week which was wonderful  We also used the Southpointe right across the road for the buffet breakfast and a couple of evening meals  and the inevitable gambling which has to be done when in Vegas  We also saw a film in the Southpointe cinema The front desk and housekeeping were very helpful and quick to respond to our requests  I must thank the writers of previous reviews  as it was through reading your reviews that we realised the significance of having black out curtains in the bedroom The first unit we were shown in block   Lily  did not have black outs  so we spoke with the front desk and requested that we be given a unit that did have them  They were very quick to respond and were able to reassign us a unti in Block   Daisy  which we were very happy with We were so happy that we have decided to stay here again when we return in e       
N =>   Great place to stay  Just got back from a one week stay at the Grandview  We had a   bedroom    bathroom suite as we were traveling with another couple  It was great  We each had our own kitchens  living space and washer dryer  We had our car so it was no trouble driving to the Strip for shows  etc  We really loved the Southpoint right next door and spent a good deal of time there  Several nice restaurants  bars and a great  quot sportsbook quot   The pool at the condo was really nice too Our beds were really comfortable but I brought my own pillow  My husband was wishing he had brought his pillow  Yes  sometimes you could hear the shower on in the room next to us  but not bad like some other reviews  The place was very clean and nice  amp  roomy  Flat screen TV s also great although there was no TV Guide which would have been nice to have since all the stations are different than in California We could not have been happier with this place and will definitely go back  We stayed in the Daisy tower which was the newest one and never had any trouble with getting parking space like some of the other reviewers  
N =>   A nice surprise  My husband and I stayed here for two nights  We were traveling with our then    month old son and a    year old cousin who was visiting us from Europe  I was dreading the timeshare sales pitch  but all they did was ask if we wanted to attend the presentation  We said  quot no  quot  and that was it  be it was my squirmy toddler who helped us out on that end  who knows  My other worry was parking as some reviews said it was hard to find with the construction  but it was fine  There was a parking garage that newly opened in the event we didn t find parking near our tower  No worries The suite was very nice   fully equipped kitchen  big bathroom  whirlpool tub  The bed was a little uncomfortable  but it was okay  My only  quot complaint quot  was that the neighbors were runnnig the whirlpool tub really late at night and making a lot of noise  in spite of a sign asking that the whirlpool not be used after     Anyway  I loved having the kitchen and being able to prepare our own food   saved a ton of money  The pool complex was fine   not big and fancy like at some of the other hotels  but it suited us just fine Overall  we would definitely stay there again  
N =>   Bad Suite Arrived Sunday evening  Hard sold a condo meeting  Saleperson refused the word NO  Finally got to our unit  Large tear in the sofa cusion was first thing we noticed  Called the front desk and they told us they would note it on our file  Later towel bar fell to floor in bathroom  It was not connected  Plumbing in bathroom plugged  They did provide us with a plunger  In kitchen we were provided with one    oz glass  Asked for additional and was told they were on back order  No phone book in unit  Asked for one and front desk said they could provide us with a number and address  Furniture in room looked worn out  The arms of the chairs were nearly bare  the coffee table was quite scuffed  It looked worse than a motel    Thursday was supposed to be our tidy up room service day  but they did not show  Pool was nice and they did get us      Sheena Easton concert tickets at the Southpoint accross the street  I expected a great room on moving in  I should have insisted on a new room which was my mistake but I believe they should be responsible for their accomodations  My belief is that The Grandview is in financial trouble or possibly very poorly managed  
N =>  We own at the Grandview We enjoyed our stay at The Grandview  We are owners and recently upgraded to a   bdrm in their new building  Staff was very courteous and professional  I loved being far enough away from the strip to escape the noise and smoke  but close enough when I was up for it  Location is convenient to many of the comforts of home  grocery store  gas station  fast food  etc  Room was clean  Luckily  we didn t have any neighbors until the day before we left  I only look forward to more improvements and expansions at The Grandview  Can t wait to visit Viva Las Vegas again   
N =>   Grandview was totally AMAZING    This was simply an amazing experience    Resort is located about    mins  from the strip but well worth the distance  Despite other reviews  we had no complications at all  We were able to check in early and check out late  NOT ONCE was i asked about a time share  nor was the staff rude in any way  The room was incredible  My girlfriend said she felt like Paris Hilton  The bedroom  living room  kitchen and bathroom were all spacious and well decorated  We ll probably never stay on the strip again as the casino s rooms do not compare to the value we received at the Grandview  
N =>   Excellent place to stay    This was the  nd time we have stayed here and it will certainly not be the last  My girlfriend and i stayed for a week in ust       The resort has improved since the last time we stayed   customer service was better and they now have a parking garage so finding a space is much easier than it used to be We were allocated to the Daisy building which is the newest of the towers and it was fantastic   everything was like new as though we were the first to stay there  They now have LCD tv s in the lounge and bedroom so this does give more space to move around and also looks better The bed was extremely comfortable and i have got to say we did not experience any unwanted noise from other rooms as has been mentioned on other reports This resort is located approximately   miles south of the main strip but as we hired a car this was not an issue for us but i think i would stay closer to the strip if i had to rely on public transport  although the resort do offer a shuttle service to and from the strip   we didn t use this so i cannot really comment on it The pool areas are well maintained and provide free towels   my only gripe with the whole resort really is that you cannot get a beer round the pool   but it s no major problem The south point casino next door is really good   pretty cheap to eat and drink there and a decent casino too  as well as bowling and a cinema complex  Oh yeh  Friday night all drinks are     You heard me right       It s also worth taking a trip to the new M resort which is about   miles further along the strip   this is a fantastic place   very luxurious All in all 
N =>  EXCELLENT I really enjoyed our stay at Grandview Las Vegas  It was a pleasant stay away from home  The rooms were excellent  the facility overall was nice  The staff was excellent as well  The location was great and I would recommend this facility to family and friends  My overall experience would be   stars  
N =>   No Free Shuttle to Strip  The Grandview is one of the finest timeshares  Clean and no bugs  However they were to have free shuttle service so I did not rent a car  When we arrived they changed the free shuttle to       each a day  Or the cab was     one way to go   miles to the strip  At the welcome meeting everyone who was there was very disturbed about the fee  One couple had just purchased their timeshare and after hearing the complaints went right to the office and got his money back They have a few free shuttle trips to the grocery and the strip twice a week is free  Next door there is South Point which has a great casino and inexpensive eating  They better change their services cause everyone was pissed The pool is very clean and a real family resort  Everyone well behaved  
N =>   Great Stay We stayed here for three days during the Las Vegas Desert Classic professional darts tournament    for us the location was perfect  just a short straight drive to Mandalay Bay where the tournament was held  Clean  Spacious  Nice  The price we found was right  But if you need internet  it costs extra  We had one problem due to a glitch in the system  but the manager went out of his way to resolve it and was very helpful We would stay there again for next year s tournament  
N =>  Nice Hotel but far from the strip Very nice hotel that is gated and has security walking around at all times  You have to have your card with you to get onto the grounds  Pretty far off the stip  Almost at the very end of las vegas blvd south  right next to South Point  Also had no shuttle service while we stayed  they told us we could use South Points but we never did because we had our own vehicle  Overall nice hotel  wouldnt stay here though if I was only in Vegas for the weekend  or if it s your first time  You are at least   km from where everything happens  it was also hard to find parking when you got back late at night  
N =>  Comfortable and Clean I was in Las Vegas for a music festival  and was delighted to find the Grandview  We were able to get two separate rooms with a connecting living area for our group at a very good rate  and the rooms were spotless  Whenever we wanted to go to the Strip  it was easy to catch a shuttle at the casino across the street  It was a great deal  
N =>   Don t Do the Timeshare Presentation    When we got there  check in was a breeze  The talked us into listening to  quot a    minute presentation about the property and some of the projects that were going on  quot  The next morning we did the presentation  We told the person we were assigned to right away that we weren t interested in buying a timeshare  we were just doing it for show tickets  She said   quot So you are just here to waste my time  quot  I thought that was a little rude  The presentation was also to include a free  quot breakfast  quot  Turns out it was donuts  muffins  coffee  and lemonade  Not even milk or juice  Two and half hours later the  quot manager quot  was giving us his  quot final quot  offer and when we declined it and said we just weren t interested in buying at the moment  he said   quot Okay  whats the real reason you aren t buying  quot  Again I thought that was rude and Im not quite sure what he was implying  THREE HOURS later we got our discount Cirque du Soleil tickets and were able to leave  I wish I would have never agreed to do it because it really aggrivated me    Anyways  the rooms were nice and clean  The walls were a little thin but we must have had pretty quiet neighbors because we didn t hear them too much  The pool area was very nice  a little cold  but never overly crowded  The only other thing I can complain about was that we ran out of toilet paper one day and called to the front desk to get some  We left  and    hours later we got back and still had no toilet paper  My husband called up to the front desk and ripped them apart a little bit  About    minutes later we finally got some t p  Overall  the hotel was nice  a good value  but don t do the timeshare presentation unless you are interested in buying one  Also NOT ENOUGH PARKING    
N =>  Watch out  I stayed at this hotel  and the thing that bothers me most is that they put a     dollar hold on my debit card  So  of course      dollars was removed from my account  It has been three days  and they still have not released the money back to my account  I have called a number of times  and they keep disconnecting me While you are there  it may be nice  but after you leave  you become very disposable  I will never stay there again due to just this  
N =>   Nice Stay but Construction Noise was very Loud  We used our timeshare to exchange and try out this particular resort  It is on the very south end of the strip but we didn t mind getting away from all the noise and it was smoke free inside our room  The room we stayed in looked brand new and had everything we needed  If you re here to visit family   it s a great place to stay  Grocery Stores and Shopping Areas are all close by  Even if the airport was just   minutes north we didn t here the planes  We had to rent a car for a week but it was only      for car and gas and we explored other areas such as Hoover Dam  local restaurants  chocolate factory  gardens  china town area  etc   I liked the points and extras they offered and ended up purchasing a timeshare here  We re planning to go to Europe and only owned   week  so with this purchase we re able to invest our money towards future trips instead of the money being gone after one visit to Paris and Italy After one year since we ve been there  we think it was a good deal investment  Now we can go on vacation     times a year without throwing our money away Only negative was that construction workers were very loud so we never slept in  They need to add dark shades curtains in bedrooms  too We re planning on returning to this resort in   Since we purchased they gave a us a voucher to go back for free for   days and   nights  If you re looking to save money and have family with you then consider staying here We re from Houston TX so a   mile commute to the casinos is nothing for us  
N =>   We loved it  My husband and I stayed at the Grandview from                 We weren t looking to stay on the Vegas strip this time so that is one of the reasons we were fine with choosing the Grandview  We stayed in the  Daisy  building which is their newest building right now  I guess they are planning to put up    more buildings in the next several years  They have a new parking garage next to the Daisy building so we never had a problem with finding a spot to park when we d come back late at night  Anyways  the room was really nice  very modern  amp  clean  The only noise we could hear through the walls was when our neighbors used the jacuzzi tub  However they have a courtesy sign next to the tub asking not to use the tub before  am and after   pm  So other than than we didn t hear anything  It looked like the maids came around everyday as well  We had a nice view of the Southpoint Casino right across the street  We really liked the Southpoint Casino  it was pretty big  very nice  and had a    hour restaurant which was very convenient  Anyways  back to Grandview  I was a little worried about some of the previous posts I d read on Tripadvisor regarding being hassled with their timeshare presentations  They asked us once when we got their and since they said they d give us      and or show tickets for going to their   hour presentation we signed up for it  The presentation started at   am and we got out of their at   pm  Then they gave us our      and we were on our way  So if you have a couple hours to spare then this is pretty harmless and you can get some good show tickets or cash  We also did the Tahiti Village timeshare presentation which was   hours  however we got   Cirque Du Soleil show tickets as well as   tickets to the Madam Tussauds celebrity wax museum  So all in all we spent   hours for   different presentations and saved around      so it was worth if for us since we were on a tight budget  We also visited the Green Valley Ranch and ate at the Original House of Pancakes their  in which the food was really good  My husband had the Irish Omelet which was fantastic  They bake their omelets instead of frying them  Anyways  the GVR was nice  I d probably recommend checking it out at least once  We also drove down to the new  M  casino  This place is immaculate inside  So modern and swanky  just very nice  I heard they have a fabulous buffet  but I we didn t eat their  They took our     bucks on the slots in less than a     hour so we split  We heard it was a billion dollar casino  in which my hubby and I chuckled a little over that when we stepped on the front grassy area and saw that it was astro turf  Oh well  Another thing we were trying to find was a casino that had Spanish    blackjack tables  I must have called around to     casino s and none of them had it anymore  The Excalibur had   table but didn t have the match the dealer side bet option which is basically the only reason my hubby and I love to play that game  Also  we rented our car through Savmor which their name used to be under ACE  They were the cheapest we found and they never had a line like all the other places we saw  So I d recommend them  So all in all I would definitely recommend staying at the Grandview  but you will want to rent a car if you plan on going further than the South point casino  The Strip is only about a      minute drive from the Grandview  
N =>   Far from Strip I stayed in the newer building  The room is very modern and all amenities  However  the strip is far  They have a free shuttle hourly starting at   am        pm going to the strip that stops at Excalibur  And going back to the hotel from the Excalibur hourly from      am       am  It you have to list yourself on the shuttles in advance or else you might not get on it the whole days because they get filled up quick  It costs about     to get to the strip in taxi  It cost    per person to get there by shuttle from to the airport  I would suggest to stay at the strip and save yourself time and money  It was a hassle to go back and forth from the strip to the hotel unless you rent a car  Southpoint hotel was next door and their buffet was ok but after two days it gets boring  
N =>   Clean and Nice place for Families We went to Grandview for   nights in early   The check in was a breeze  No timeshare harrassment  Room was clean  I agree walls are thin and can hear everything  I would stay there again with family  Not a Vegas party place  Cabs run     to get to Harrahs  The hotel next door has good food for reasonable prices  
N =>   Wheelchair accessible rooms are TERRIBLE  First let me say that after    years in a wheelchair I have learned what to ask of places before traveling  but this place lies and makes a disabled person feel so much more disabled than before you come here  First  because of an all day fiasco at the airport unrelated to this review  we arrived at The Grandview at  am on Saturday il   th to find that there were no  I mean NO available parking spaces  When people on here said the parking was bad  I way underestimated the problem  It was raining and cold so my husband let me out at our building and went to park   over at Southpoint I think  I waited for him so we went to the room together  I have stayed at some amazing timeshare resorts  but was keeping an open mind since I have never been to Vegas  We were on the  th floor of the Jasmine building  Upon entering the unit I thought everything was okay  a little small compared to others I have been to  but that was okay  I just wanted to get out of my wheelchair that I had been in since  am Friday morning  Well  a good nights sleep was not to be had since there was NO WAY to even get into the bed  It was taller than me in my wheelchair so I couldn t transfer and so high that my husband could not lift me either  I called the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and the manager would be in at  am  So the first night in Vegas I spent my night in my wheelchair  On the next day I got no resolution with the manager on duty and decided to call RCI to see if we could be relocated to another resort  Only one could be found available in all of Las Vegas that said they had an accessible unit  so we went to see it  Again  RCI was lied to by the other resort  The doors were not even wide enough to get in the room  We went back to The Grandview where I spent yet another night in my wheelchair  On Easter Sunday the general manager of the resort was there and I got the opportunity to speak to him by phone  All he would say is that they were ADA compliant  I told him that wasn t true because the bed was not accessible and he just said that it was and he had never had any complaints from people in wheelchairs before  which we later found out was another lie  Anyways  my husband told him that he was taking the bed off the frame by any means possible so that the bed would be lower and so I could get some rest  This GM was very disrespectful to me as a guest at his resort  We did get the frame off the bed and it made it lower  but still a little high  Also  I had noticed in the kitchen that all of the lower cabinets were empty  I could not reach a cup  plate or bowl there  When I brought this up while talking to the GM he said that if I would have requested it before I got there they would have moved it down  be he should think about the fact that this was supposed to be a wheelchair accessible unit          shouldn t access to dishes be a given  Then  the final straw was the roll in shower  It was very small  Although I do understand the need of a disabled person to be able to roll into a shower  usually there is some sort of slope to keep the water inside and help direct waterflow to the drain  Not here  It was all flat  So guess what happened when my husband was helping me out of the shower     he slipped and I injured my foot trying to get back in my chair  I will say that Vegas is a pretty place with all the mountains and beautiful sunrises  but the people there are not generally friendly to the disabled and have an  quot I don t care quot  attitude  The positives which have nothing to do with The Grandview  are  The folks at Treasure Island are incredible  The valet had my wheelchair put together before my husband reached the trunk to retrieve it  and it is not an easy chair to figure out  Also  when one of my wheels popped off right outside TI  we went in and within   minutes    men from the engineering department were fixing my wheel and got me going again  Thank you Treasure Island  At the Mirage  we saw the Secret Garden and the dolphins and it was a wonderful afternoon  Nevada is a pretty place  just don t go to The Grandview if you are in need of an accessible unit or a friendly staff      you will have a more  quot grand view quot  if you stay away from this place  
N =>   Scam to get you into time share junk They have low rates to lure you into buying their time share junk  The condo was new and nicely furnished with IKEA type furniture but it is not worth the hassle  
N =>   Be carefull I used an exchange to stay at the Grandview since I was going there for the national bowling tournament  When we first got there we were   hrs early  but they got us in a room right away so we were happy  Our room was really big  we had an A and B room which I liked  But there is   huge problem with all the rooms  quot  yes i said all quot  even the new ones they show you in the presentation have this problem  It is paper thin walls  If someone goes to the bathroom in the room above you  you can hear it  The wind out side you can hear as if you had no walls  there is a warning about no hot tub after    pm and I was woken up to it at  am in the morning to    Loud is an understatement  Next is the location it is   miles off the strip  You MUST have a car  People say it is not necessary  they are on crack you MUST have a car  Taxi is up to     one way  a total rip off  plus the shuttle is a joke for a multi billion dollar company there should be a shuttle every half an hour  not every   hrs  Next is the presentation  we wanted free money so we signed up right away we  me and my friend Jon from college  got   show tickets and      which was a good deal  After the presentation was the sales pitch my lady was nice and i told her i just bought a condo last month so i had no money to spend on another condo and she left me alone   this strategy works best if you want to say NO   But my friend who went with another lady was a totally different story  She was nice to him at the beginning but at the sales pitch she sexually harassed him saying he was an   out of     And when he said he was not going to buy she did a     and said he was the gayest person she ever met and called him a virgin and then said he would stay that way forever  I Think we should SUE them but I don t know  That is y they are getting a very low rate Plus if you are going to Vegas for the national bowling tournament  none of the casino s care that you are there at all  Prepare to be ignored by everyone except  quot binion s  quot  but that casino was great The south point casino was great they always had tables open  and it was a close walk to get there  Their food is terrible but the gambling is great so I like it  
N =>   Pleasant Stay over Easter My wife    year old son and I stayed at Grandview for   nights in a   BR suite through RCI exchange over Easter week  Staff was friendly and efficient  There was a separate check in desk for owners  but we did not have to wait at all LocationThe resort is located several miles south of The Strip  Depending on your purpose for visiting Las Vegas  that is either a major plus or minus  It is away from the congesting of the casinos  There is Southpoint Casino next door  But you do need a car to get other places  like grocery stores  We planned on and visited Hoover Dam  Death Valley and Red Rock Canyon  so the location was great for our purposes  It is also right next to I    so access to the highway is quick and easy There is a free shuttle from the resort to from Excalibur  It leaves and picks on every     hours  But you have to make reservations for specific times and space on the shuttle is limited  Not very convenient unless you know you are going to spend a set number of hours at The Strip  But if you have a car  parking at the casinos is available for free AccommodationThe resort is made up of several    story high rise buildings  Several taller building are nearly finished  Parking was a bit tight although a parking deck is under construction The suite design is a bit unusual  Two suites share a small locked foyer  After you unlock the foyer door  you have to use your key again to open your assigned suite  Not sure the benefit of this design over the traditional connecting door between suites  Our neighbor cooked a lot so we got to smell their food which gets trapped in that foyer  We never had a problem  but I can foresee a noisy neighbor coming in late  making a lot of noise in that foyer before entering their own suite The room itself was very nice  Spacious  Furnishing are up to date and comfortable  Cabinets were made of particle board with laminate but adequate  We did not find any problems in the room  Walls are a little thin so we could near people talking from time to time  But because the resort is off The Strip  it probably kept the party crowd away  so we were never really bothered by noise Wi fi speed was excellent in the room but there is a fee      day or     week   There is free computer use at the main office  but I understand that it can get a bit crowded  And there is no privacy  good to do quick email check or print boarding passes There is a safe in the room  They ask if you are planning to use it when checking in  so they can charge you      We declined because we had not planned to use it  But my son  decided to check it out  We were not charged for its use  so I suppose it is on the honor system Resort  amp  AmenitiesThere are   nice pools  one heated  In il  water was very cold in the unheated pool  Also   hot tubs  Poolside towel were provided  A deli is located by the pool for groceries and snacks  There is also an exercise room  Several gas grills are available  if you are so inclined Timeshare SalesI read many negative reviews about Grandview s timeshare sales pitch so I was a bit weary when I checked in  I already own lots of timeshare so I was not interested  They politely offered a    minute presentation upon check in which we declined  They did not push it any further and never called our room to try to get us to attend  Only other sales pitch was that we got an  quot invitation quot  flier for free stuff if we attend a sales presentation  I suppose the nightmare begins when they do get you trapped  But if you really are not interested in purchasing any timeshare  don t bother going to the presentation just to save         on tickets  Probably not worth the headaches because it is the sales person s job to sell  sell  and sell SummaryAll in all  we enjoyed our stay at Grandview  If I go back to Las Vegas  I would not hesitate to stay at Grandview again  
N =>  Great place to stay  st the postive  great location if you have car on south end of town near    very clean units w all ammedities kitchen etc front desk helpful SouthPoint Casino isright across the way  amp  has great buffet bowling theater etc now negative   parking is limited not enough towels in room soundproofinglimited between rooms pool not heated  amp  very cold computer room decentbut not enough computers i ve stayed here numerous times  amp  would stay again  
N =>   Excellent value  Ideal if you don t want to be living on the Strip Just back from six lovely days at the Grandview  Our room was very clean and the staff excellent  If you do not want to buy a timeshare then don t go to the presentation  My only small complaint was that they charge to use the wireless internet  Using the free service in the Media Centre can take for ages as some guests do not adhere to the    minute rule  Also there is no privacy  Having a car is a must and gives you more fleaxability  Its only a short drive to the strip where you can park easily at any of the hotels  The Interstate is behind the complex  I don t think I will return to Las Vegas but would recommend anyone to stay at the Grandview 
N =>   Worst place everrrrrrr stay away         I don t even knoqw where to begin except that this is a place that I will never make a reservation at or recomend to anyone  I made my reservations on the   th of       for a friends wedding that we were attending  After spending an hour on the phone and put on hold three times all lasting about ten minutes I finally got my reservation confirmed and paid for  I told them that we were not going to be checking in until aout one in the morning because we had a late flight and they reassured me that it would be ok and that we will not have a problem  We finally get there at about     am only to finde out that they did not have our reservation and we were no where on their system  Our name  reservation number  they had no record of none of it  We were furious here we are tired from a long day and did not have a room  Thank God for our frinds that also had the same problem  there were four of us couples  and went ahead and reserved us a room at the South Point right next to this resort  If it had not been for our friends we would have been all over Vegas a two in the morning trying to get a room  They made no appologies for the inconvenience that they caused us  We had to demand our refund back and threatned them with a Lawyer if they did not put back out money  First time in Las Vegas and had to experience this  So please if you are going to stay somewhere stay at the SOUTH POINT THEY WERE EXCELLENT AND TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THE GRANDVIEW HAD DONE  
N =>   Great for Families We just spent a week at Grandview and had a wonderful time  We had two rooms and our group had   adults and   children under    yrs  This was not our first trip to Vegas and didn t need to stay near the main strip area  been there  done that   This place is close to grocery stores  outlet malls  and easy freeway access  Easy walk to South Point Casino next door  Grownups went to play in casino and kids played in bowling alley and arcade  Good breakfast and lunch buffett Parking area was busy  but no worse than other time shares we have visited of this size  Recommend you have a car if staying here  Great place to stay if you are planning on doing more than just visiting strip area  
N =>   Loved this place Stayed for one week here  Used the one bedroom unit  Super clean  furniture was clean  bedding was crisp  Have nothing negative to say about this Condo  will definately be back here on my next trip to Vegas  Entire staff was super friendly and helpful  What I really enjoyed was the internet room it had   computers to use to help do your research on Vegas or to get your airline passes  
N =>   Nice place away from the strip Just returned from Las Vegas and a stay at the Grandview  Our experience was good to great  I would say the high pressure sales of the timeshare presentation is true that you read from others  But just keep saying no  if you decide to go  Our view was okay  the one nice thing was the new  quot M quot  opened the day after we arrived and we got to enjoy the fireworks from our unit  Other than that we got to see construction next door  The staff I have to say was beyond excellent  The day we were leaving our flight wasn t until    pm  We assummed we could check our luggage with the airline  so we returned our car and went to the airport  However you can t check your bags until   hours before your flight  So we called the Grandview back  they held our bags  let us use the shuttle back to the strip  and then back to the resort  We still had time to waste  they let us use the computers to waste some time and just bent over backwards to make our bad starting day finish off good  The Grandview is located a way down from the strip  but with the shuttle they run  you would be fine with no car  They are located in an up and coming location  Don t hesitate to stay here     
N =>  Great Place   Despite the Bad Reviews First of all  I decided to stay here for two reasons     We are time share owners and    there were only two places featured for Las Vegas and this was one of them  I was hesitant at first after reading a couple of negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised at how friendly and accomodating the staff were  Of course when I arrived and informed the staff that I was an owner they directed me to the  quot VIP quot  check in  the hostess was pleasant and tried to offer me some tickets if we  quot toured quot  the resort and I politely declined  During our stay there was no phone calls or pressure to attend one of their seminars which was a pleasant surprise since I have been to other time share resorts and they bombard you with calls from the moment you arrive but no  not here not at the Grandview  We were put in the Jasmine building which is what I was going to request for anyway since I had read that the building was the newest one  We were put in the   th floor overlooking the construction of their newest building  which concerned me at first but since this was a long weekend  ruary        there was no construction going on as I was assured when I checked in  It was a great room  very very clean  the bed  a king sized bed  was VERY comfy and cozy  The jacuzzi was a great treat especially after walking all day on the Strip or after our return from a beautiful day the Grand Canyon  we drove  highly recommend   The only one minor complaint is that the walls are thin so if you plan on partying you need to either be considerate of the other guests or you need to take your partying back to the strip  We could hear full conversations late at night but they did not last for long  This resort is located just minutes away from the Strip  literally right down the street  but not in walking distance   If you are going to stay here I recommend renting a car in order to fully enjoy the area  We will definitely be staying there next time we go to Vegas and we will definitely be recommending this resort to family and friends  
N =>  This was the first    This was our first trip and our last trip to the Grandview  Upon check in we were given a room in the Lily building  When we first walked in the room it looked a little worn and the furniture was stained  but that was fine  Not what you would have thought for a resort but it was OK  The first night of our stay our the sheets were so worn out the elastic would not hold the sheet on the mattress so I called for a replacement the next morning  They delivered the sheets  but that was it   they delivered them  I put them on  But none of these small details prepared us for what was in our future  The very following morning we woke up to have live roaches in our bed and running across the living area floor  Upon calling the main desk they offered to come up and exterminate  I told them that was unacceptable  I then was told they would move us to another building  but they could not give a refund  We did accept the room in a newer building but the vacation was already ruined  We have traveled a great deal in the last    years and this was the first of ever having creatures in any of our rooms  let alone our bed  Vegas is a great place to visit  but I would definately say  if you are planning a visit I would stay any place else but the Grandview   
N => Avoid the Time Share Presentation    WATCH OUT  My husband and I just wanted to buy tickets to a show and we were told about this great offer regarding cheap tickets if we  quot just quot  went on a tour of the Grandview resort for a couple of hours one day  We didn t see the harm  The cheap tickets were appealing  along with free dining vouchers and gaming chips so we thought why not  but DON T BE FOOLED   Even at this stage  there was an abnormal amount of questions regarding our income  occupations etc which did unnerve us  We were told on the coach on the way over that we were going to have our own individual tour guides for the duration of the  quot tour quot  and we were under no obligation to buy anything  When we entered the property we were shortly called by our  quot  Tour Guide quot   He showed us to some  quot free quot  breakfast where he waited impatiently for us to grab some food drinks  He then led us to a table where we proceeded to sit for approx three hours and listen to a spiel on time sharing  We were annoyed as we were totally disillusioned by the whole thing  He claimed there was no obligation to buy but this was so far from the truth  Throughout his rant  he was extremely pushy and ignorant  He ignored and dismissed all of our questions and when we said no  he continued to push and push us  whilst at the same time insulting our lifestyle of which he knew nothing about  His starting asking price was         which he could not seem to understand when we explained that this was a huge amount of money and there was no way we could make a decision like this investment in the space of a few hours  We were pushed into a corner and it was absolutely horrible  It felt like we were targeted for superfiical reasons and in his mind  we were a sure thing  We both have a lot of patience and when we complimented the whole idea  informing him for the fifth or so time that were saving for a house as we are just married and there was no way we could afford this investment at this time  he turned nasty  At this time I insisted I didn t want to hear anymore  He then proceeded to bring over the manager who continued  I was fuming  although funnily enough the price was brought down to          with again the crippling interest rate of        Again we claimed we were not interested and got up to leave  Whilst collecting the free gifts  another attempt was made  This time it was brought down to        I felt the whole experience was horrible  The sales manager was manipulative and sly and I would definitely warn people against going on this  quot tour quot   All we could think of was that some poor people get sucked into buying the shares at the original price of          which is just daylight robbery  The whole thing appears to be a SCAM    If these are the kind of people who run the Grandview resort  I would say avoid like the plague    
N =>  Great Time at the Grandview  We had a great time at the Grandview   It was so nice to have a full kitchen and washer dryer during our long stay in Vegas  We rented a car  as is advised  and it was worth it to have the ease  We parked for free at the casinos and spent the day  and or evening  walking from place to place  It was nice to easily get back to rest and change in between day activities and night activities  There are several grocery options nearby  Walmart  Target  etc  with a car  We also easily rode out to the Hoover Dam   great side trip and really easy We loved the SouthPoint and gambled there a bit  Friendly staff and fun tables  had good luck at the slots too  There are movies  bowling and a spa there but we did not have time to take advantage of these things We wished for a few things  a fan in the bathroom   it got very steamy and hot  curtains  or darker blinds  in the bedroom   it was VERY bright VERY early each day  a heated or indoor pool   too cold outside  even if there were some folks who dared  We did not pay for the Internet as we have acccess on our PDA s but we did rent the safe      for the week   Easy to use and gave us a feeling of safety  Please make sure to pull your unit doors shut when you go out as they ARE heavy but did not always seem to shut the whole way by themselves We WERE able to hear  and smell the cooking of   the neighbors right next door  there is a common keyed entrance for every two units into a foyer of sorts  then another keyed entrance to the individual unit entrance   This could have been a concern  but it was a weekend rental  not the whole week we were there We would come back here and would reccomend it to others    
N =>  Grandview Vacation We own a timeshare through Hilton Vacations but were unable to use the points  so we transferred them to RCI and planned our trip  The check in was ok  the staff at the front desk was not very helpful  but the time to check in was about   minutes  We were then told to go over to get our parking pass  which I wondered why we could not do this at the same time we checked in  but then I found out why They wanted us to sign up for a presentation  we already own so I was a little confused  and were very pushy  The  quot shows quot  they had tickets for I had already been to so I decided to opt for the    for gambling We went to the presentation  which was not really pleasant  but got through it and even though they really did not want to give is the vouchers for gambling they did   I actually made       off the vouchers  The rooms are nice and I love the full kitchen and washer and dryer  The beds are comfortable  the only thing that was not great was that our room keys kept expiring every day  We had to keep calling to get new keys  By the third set of keys they finally got things right South Point is right across the street  and we have stayed there a few times so I know that the place is great Other than the room key issue  pushy sales people  and very noisy housekeeping staff at     am in the nextdoor unit  I will come back again  
N =>  Great Place For Those Who Want To Be Away from the Strip AccommodationsThe suite was great  We had a very clean one bedroom suite  which was a little smaller than some of the condos we ve stayed elsewhere but larger than a hotel suite  such as Residence Inn or Homewood   The suite had a sofa sleeper  a full kitchen and a washer and dryer  There was a safe in the bedroom      to rent   In suite wireless Internet access was        for the week  The noise level was only a problem when the people above us chose to use their Jacuzzi at     AM  it clearly states in your arrival documents as well as on a place by the tub to be conscientious of your neighbors and use it between  am and   pm   We had two large TVs  one with a DVD player LocationIf you are staying for a week  this is the way to go  I loved NOT being on the trip  particularly during Halloween  The South Point casino was right next door and offered everything the strip casinos offered   nice restaurants  plenty of space for gambling  no waiting for machines   and entertainment  The resort offered shuttle service to get to the Strip  which is only   miles away  We rented a car so we could shop  malls and groceries  including Wal t market nearby  and didn t have trouble with parking Check In We arrived at the resort at noon yet they had our suite ready for us  I asked for a room with a view and they gave us one facing the Strip  which is   miles away   We were directed to another person to get our parking pass  That person asked if we were interested in seeing a show  I said yes   she then said they would provide us with two tickets for the show we wanted for only      the tickets would have cost us about       plus       certificates for gambling  I told them emphatically that  if this was a timeshare presentation  we were NOT interested as we already have a timeshare  She insisted they just wanted to show us around the facility in hopes we d tell our friends to come to their resort  We met for lunch  which was sandwiches  dessert and beverages  the next afternoon  It was supposed to take    minutes but took   hours  The young lady who took us around was very nice and we were very upfront with her about NOT being interested in purchasing another timeshare  although I will admit  that  had we NOT already owned one  we would have made the purchase   She said she understood but still wanted to show us around  Afterwards  it was the same as with any timeshare presentation   you say NO  they get their manager  After we said NO for the  rd time  they said okay and directed to a man to give us our tickets  When we sat down with him  he gave us ANOTHER pitch  This is where my husband almost lost it  He said we just want our tickets  He directed us to another room where there were several  quot We All Said No quot  couples also waiting for their tickets  We finally got to someone  told them what date and show we wanted to see and had to wait for    minutes for confirmation that our tickets were available for that day  After approval  we were told to show up early that day to make sure we got the tickets we wanted  Criss Angel at the Luxor at  PM on Tuesday   We got to the Luxor at noon on Tuesday and they told us no tickets were available  We had to go for Thursday and the tickets were for the furthest row of the theater  and we couldn t pay the difference to get better seats   We took the tickets and certificates DiningWe were tired when we arrived so decided to try room service from Scotty s Bean  which was on site  We ordered chicken wings   got   for       and they weren t fully cooked  We ended up spending     for   wings  a cheeseburger with fries and small salad and a Cobb salad and some smoothies  which were DELICIOUS    For most dining after that  we opted for the South Point  very good restaurants with reasonable rates OverallWe would definitely stay here again  We just would make sure we didn t attend the presentation  
N =>  Perfect accomodation A week at the Grandview was given to us as a gift to celebrate our   th wedding anniversary  We have been to Las Vegas many times and always stayed on or near the strip  No more   We were welcomed graciously  and made to feel at home  Our suite was very beautiful and convenient  A great surprise was the closeness to the South Point Casino  Just a close walk across the side street  and we did that often  The pool was great  and warm  We mixed our own cocktails and small lunch and sat by the pool to enjoy  Parking was never a problem  We had a unit overlooking the pool on the back side of Sage  We always found a spot in the back making it very convenient to enter to our room  The grounds were very clean  as was the building  After the congestion and noise of  quot the Strip quot  it was so welcoming to return to the peace and quiet of the Grandview  
N =>   FANTASTIC Experience Grandview   Las VegasWe exchanged our Timeshare with RCI for a   Bedroom   Bath unit  at the Grandview at Las Vegas  as there was another couple traveling with us  We were given a   Bed A B unit  The   units that make up a   Bed  A B unit are the equivalent of two   Bedroom units  Each unit is huge with a TV in the living room and another in the Bedroom  Large Jacuzzi Tub  large shower and a   sink bathroom  Oodles of closet space and lost of drawers  The Grandview was equal to or exceeded all of our expectations Check In  When we arrived at Grandview  we discovered that Check In was a breeze   Don t forget to pickup the  PARKING PERMIT  during check in   We were in the  Jasmine  building which is the newest building of the   or   buildings that make up Grandview  There are two more buildings under construction Maintenance  On Sunday morning  we had a problem with the TV reception in the  A  unit on the Living Room TV  and called Maintenance  A man was at the door within    minutes and worked on the problem  Even though he had to make a few trips for parts he was determined  We left for our day s activities before he had completed his repairs  but gave him permission to enter and make his repairs  We left around    AM and returned around   PM and discovered that not only did the Living Room TV not work  but neither did the TV in the Bedroom  and the Bedroom Lights did not work  I again called Maintenance and again a man was there in short order  He worked on the electricity and called in another man to assist  It took them about an hour  but when they left the TV s in the Living Room  Bedroom  and all the Lights were working properly  On Monday morning around   AM another crew showed up to make the repairs  We advised them the repairs were made the night before  My thoughts are that Grandview responds promptly  Our electrical problem was out of the ordinary but they stayed on it until it was repaired properly and everything operated normally  We had no further problems of any kind Parking I had read bad reviews of the Grandview regarding inadequate parking  Our experience was that there was not a parking problem  I reasoned that it was because we were in the end building  next to the new buildings under construction  All of the paving and parking areas are completed  but security fences block some of them off  We found that around our building there were always vacant parking spots  regardless of the time of day  I imagine that if I were staying in one of the buildings in the middle of the complex that there could be parking issues Room service In the information packets we were given at check in  we were informed that on the  th day there would be room service  We were gone on the fourth day during the daytime  and it was obvious that there had been some cleaning   garbage baskets  dishwasher  new towels  etc   but the bedding was not changed  We rather expected that the bedding to be changed sometime during the week  but this was not the case  We ended up washing them in the Washer Dryer in our unit NO Pressure to attend sales meeting  During Check In we were asked to attend a free breakfast to explain the future plans for Grandview  We were told this was not a sales presentation  but rather to have us come back to Grandview on our next visit to Las Vegas  We told them that we would decide later as for right now we just wanted to get settled  There was a flyer stuck in our door one day offering a free breakfast to attend an information session  but we never acknowledged it  There was NO pressure for us to attend anything of any kind whatsoever 
N =>   Great Place to Stay in Las Vegas It is just south of the strip but only took five minutes or less to get to the  quot Welcome to Las Vegas quot  sign  The staff was very friendly  They allowed us to pre check in since we arrived so early in the morning and then followed through with a call to let us know our room was ready  The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable  I did not participate in the resort activities as I was so busy elsewhere  but they posted activites calendar in the elevators  I was not pushed to do a timeshare sales walk either  While it is best to have a car  I drove to the nearest  quot Duece quot  bus stop    minute from resort  and parked and rode the bus around the strip     for    hours  get on  get off when you like up and down the strip  You can catch the bus from in front of the resort but you will need to go to the change station  Bottom line is don t get stressed if you don t want to drive  There is a huge Town Square AND Outlet Center on Las Vegas Blvd  I WOULD DEFINITELY CHOOSE TO STAY HERE again without reservation  
N =>   Great Place to stay We just returned from a full week in Las Vegas staying at the Grandview  We had a wonderful time and we would definitely return to the Grandview again and again  Our trip was focused on my husband s birthday with friends flying in to meet us  The Grandview was able to give me an identical suite right next to ours for just an additional        We had so much room between the two rooms for ourselves and another couple  We hosted two parties while we were there and the setup was more than perfect  The front desk staff was always helpful and the place was extremely clean  We saw some rooms being cleaned after checkout and they even moved all the furniture to make sure the floors were cleaned everywhere  It was so nice to have a living room  dining area  kitchen  separate bedroom and a large bathroom  We loved the pool area which really made us feel that we were on vacation and not in downtown Vegas  The outdoor hot tub was awesome  We rented a car  however  the complex provided shuttle service to town all day long  The drive to town was also easy  Taking the highway was only a    minute drive to the strip or just staying on Las Vegas Blvd took only    minutes  We were back and forth a few times a day  The Southpoint Casino is right next door and only a   minute walk  Odds of winning seemed better here than on the strip  Great buffets    You can t possibly go wrong when booking the Grandview  You will love it  
N =>  Nothing special We have just returned from a weeks stay using one of our RCI exchange weeks at Grandview and could not find anything special or stunning about this place   it was just about that maybe what is expected  In general the standards were good   the buildings and rooms very clean and equiped to for anything you wanted with a kitchenette   washing machine   tumbler dryer   dishwasher   large fridge freezer  fully air conditioned   the only problem was no shop to buy food  We spotted one across the main highway but it seemed a mission to reach and got the impression this was a tatic to get you in the south point casino next door  Depending where you are allocated can be a problem with ongoing building work and car parking seemed an issue   they run a very good and reliable shuttle bus to the strip if needed   Our initial allocation was in Iris building on floor   but was moved after protest to the top   th floor as this place must have been built on a budget because to can hear everything around   above  amp  next to you   especially when baths are being run   the noise of this and the water pipes about is incredible    the walls and floor are so thin with certain areas ceramic tiled   this just makes for a ear numbing racket  Bear in mind this is a timeshare resort so you will be steered in the direction of a    minute session but if you take this up you can get free show dinner or gaming vouchers   at least they are not too bad   kept to their word and leave you alone afterwards   we managed to get      food vouchers for the Luxor which come in handy  If you are considering staying here   it is miles out of the way with not much around at the moment and unless you are hard of hearing   take some earplugs   oh and leave the kids behind   unless they are keep open air swimmers   there is not much else for them Sorry   i know loads of people like this place but Would only return if desperate  short on money or given an all expensives paid week   it just isn quot t spectular   
N =>   WOW and a whole lot more  We just had our first Las Vegas experiance and we had an unbelievable trip  And it all started with the Grandview at Las Vegas  Our flight arrived in the early moring but we went right to the Grandview anyway just to see if we could check in early  Our room wasn t ready yet but they did call as soon as it was and let us check in early without any hassle at all  Staff was extremely friendly and had a ton to offer  The Grandview is a vacation club as we already knew and of course they offered a presentaion  which we went to without hesitation and we were offered show tickets to a show of our choice at a great discounted rate  We saved      and got great seats at Mystere  Now  we were already owners of another timeshare and that is how we ended up at The Grandview  but after sitting through their presentation  we loved it so much we bought into their club as well  It was definately an offer we couldn t refuse  As for the rooms  outstanding  A full suite with jaquzzi and full kitchen  Well kept and not outdated like other places we have stayed at  Overall a     and we cant wait to come back and stay here again  
N =>  Nice experience Just returned from the Grand View where we had a very enjoyable experience  Were able to book both an A and B condo so elderly family was just next door  Next door to the South Point Casino where we were able to see the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon  a highlight of our trip  Staff very friendly  no sales pressure on time shares  Pool great  some weekend problems with parking but not weekday  This is due to construction  No noise from that      weekly charge for Wi Fi was our only concern  Public computers     in lobby  a nice touch  Snack bar  poolside was great for snacks and souvenirs  We got a rental car  but the resort has a shuttle to the strip and was reliable  
N =>  Nice Place I booked this exchange through RCI and was a bit concerened by the distance to the strip  Although it wasn t a terrible commute  I would have rathered being closer to the action  The distance necessitated us getting a rental car  a first for me in   trips to Vegas That being said  the rooms were large  clean and comfortable  Had it not been for the South Point Casino next door I would have hated my stay  but the casino was in walking distance  had resturants  buffets  a cinema and a bowling alley  Which worked out well for my family which included my two boys     amp      and my mother in law We reserved two units and experienced rather small correctable problems  We did not attend a presentation  and did not feel pressured to do so Overall we did alot of outlet shopping  visited the Hoover Dam  and Freemont Street  and had an enjoyable trip  
N =>  We loved Grandview We stayed at Grandview in   We are owners at Wyndham   had points banked at RCI  We thought the resort was beautiful and clean  I think we stayed in the Jasmine building  You need a car  but this time we did some site seeing which was nice for a change  Parking on the stripe is free  so no problem when we wanted to go to the strip  We went to South Pointe to eat and found it very nice  even saw a movie one afternoon  We did go to the Time Share event and they are a little pushie but you got to expect that  Our room was great   I would go back again it was nice being away from the strip  Must go to Ellis Island   Steak  Baked Pot  Salad and Beer for        Went to see the LOVE Beatle show   excellent  Also  Carrott Top   excellent  Can t wait to go again  We still have points left at RCI and we are going to stay at Grandview  
N =>   vacation from hell the place has NO service   NO anything   it was so bad that i spent  days of my   day trip there and left      paid to stay at another hotel   the cost to get around from that hotel would have cost upward of       for the week   they have a shuttle but it runs on a book by the day to use  first come first serve  the staff could have cared less with helping guests  the most important thing is to sell the time share  don t worry about the guest   they are already here    again the place is in the middle of nowhere  with no stores no restruants   they don t even help with airport runs when you leave     it is a shame    when i left after only   days they didn t even want to know why   but i told them      colleen santostaunton  ma      c      aol comfeel free to contact me if you have any questions 
N =>   Not on a give away  I cannot begin to tell you how horrible Grandview is  If you havent been to Grandview    DO NOT GO  The free gifts and  quot sucker packages quot  arent worth the headache  disrespect and overall attitude you will deal with from their staff and sales people  Remember people  there is NO SUCH THING as a free lunch My husband and I were approached during our recent trip to Las Vegas by a very sweet lady offering free shows  dining credit or free gaming she explained that if we were willing to spend     hours touring a timeshare opportunity  we would  upon complimention be handsomely rewareded with upto         in free gaming  dining  or show credits   all we had to do was hand over        bucks cash and board a shuttle   Upon arriving at the Grandview Sales Center  we were ushered into a small room for a  quot short quot  presentation  They started off explaining that Grandview DID NOT participate in  quot high pressure sales quot  and that we were all under no pressure to purchase the timeshare   they were simply  quot educating quot  us for our own good  Although many things that the sales staff showed us made sense   my husband and I opted to not make an impulse purchase and enter into debt without spending time talking it over and looking further into things  Like many people  my husband and I never considered buying into a timeshare before arriving at Grandview   and weren t prepared to plop down         on a whim after spending only a brief amount of time on the actual property  Our decision was final   in our minds  at least  However  in complete contridiction to what they intially said  the Grandview Sales staff did not take  quot NO quot  for an answer  We tried  several times  to explain that we liked what was offered  however  we arent impluse purchase people   and wanted to mull it over  That we were not comfortable saying  quot Yes  we ll pay         a month for the next three years     quot   They kept pushing and pushing  Finally  after explaining no less than   times that we were not buying a timeshare  quot RIGHT NOW quot  we were ushered into a final room which is where things got really out of hand    Up until this point  I can go along with the whole thing  The staff was doing their job  and I was standing my ground   they remained friendly and ergo I was doing my best to stay sweet and explain our position the best I could    The last man we met  however  was the rudest most imcompetent man I have ever come in contact with  While he pitched us one last time  I went to say something   he stopped  looked at me and said  quot Are you interupting me  quot I was flabberghasted  Interupted him  I was telling him no   and because thats not what he wanted to hear  he got     and offended me in such a way that words will never do it justice  My husband  who is genuinely a kind man and has the patience of a saint  really bristled at this out of line comment  The sales man asked  quot if he had ruffled my feathers quot  to which my husband said  quot this is over   we re leaving quot   As you can probably imagine  it was shocking  embarassing  and absolutely uncalled for  When you re considering or being asked to make a huge purchase  which I would absolutely consider a timeshare with a price tag in excess of         to be    I think that you should be treated with kid gloves  On top of the incident above  when I tried to explain to him that we just purchased a house  and a car   we went on say that  quot I understand  you don t have the money quot     which was an assumption on his part   and a wrong one to boot  Just because I choose not to spend money with him there doesn t mean I don t have it to spend elsewhere   Walking out of Grandview I was sick to my stomach  And I can promise you  if I decide to purchase a timeshare for my family   it will not be thru Grandview     
N =>   Great Time We stayed at the Grandview                  Our room was in the Iris Building  Room was beautiful   Clean  and comfortable  Not sure why there are bad reviews  We were not pressured into timeshare sales  Pressure was seen more from sales people on the strip  The pool was just opened at this building so the water was cold but I am sure after it is there awhile it will warm up  But the hot tub was nice at the pool  Never had any problems parking or with much noise  Could hear water from another room but not real often  I have heard worse in a hotel  You just have to remember you are still in a  quot hotel quot  setting  We loved our Jacuzzi in our room  It wasn t a problem to not be in it after   pm  South Point was not as great as some reviews  Liked the buffets better on the strip  The Steak place in South Point was good  We rented a car  I do think that is a must here  We took day trips to the Hoover dam   mins away and worth the drive  then we also visited the Grand Canyon a bit farther maybe       hours but well worth it also  I would stay here again  Everyone was nice and helpful Don t let the bad reviews scare you    Go and enjoy yourself   
N =>  No Parking We are owners of another resort  We stayed at the Grandview as there were no rooms available at ours  I was appalled that there was such difficulty finding parking  I have a disabled mother who was with me  There were far too few handicapped spaces and virtually NO spaces of any kind if we got back after    PM  I would have to let her out and make her stand there by the door until I parked wqay in the back and came back to help her to our room  What is worse is that they are expanding  This means an even bigger parking problem This needs to be fixed  
N =>   excellent place to stay  our stay at the grandview was quite a very pleasant surprise  after reading several reviews re the  quot paper thin quot  walls  service  etc   we found no problems with the unit  it was clean  comfortable   amp  spacious  it was like having an apartment of our own in las vegas  the staff were friendly  helpful  accommodating   amp  most gracious all around  while it was off the strip  it was still close enough to be able to get to all attractions  shows  etc  this is one place we ll definitely be going back to   hopefully soon  
N =>  Mistreated Let me tell you  I called on the    to confirm my reservations and was greeted with a major attitude  I called and the person who answered the phone said  quot what do you want quot  I asked about my reservations which were confirmed then had the phone slammed down  I don t even know who the person was  Once there we checked in and were quickly sent to a  quot oweners meeting where they tried to sell us a different time share option  They would not take no for an answer  We left telling them we are on vaction and do not plan on spending the whole day with the sales staff  To continue with this annoying visit  We tried to use the washer and stove  both were broke and I was told some one will be up to fix them  quot NEVER HAPPENED    quot  We were also told since we are owners we are no longer entitled to a welcome gift  Fine but when we asked for an extra wash cloth we were informed that it is   per room and we got ours  quot TWO MY BUTT quot  I have been to the grandview before and had a nice stay but will not go back again  I prefer the CLIFFS at PEACE CANYON  The staff is more concerned about your visit not their personal life while at work 
N => Fantastic Staff Accomodations and Hospitality  Don t believe the reviews We have a timeshare and originaly booked at the Summer Bay Resort off Las Vegas Blvd  After reading the terrible reviews we re booked  free through RCI  at the Grandview at RCI s Recommendation  We were pleasantly pleased with the re booking  This place is a Jewel in the Desert  We checked in around   pm    th by Cynthia who quickly became a great friend  We told her we were there for our   th wedding Anniversary and she never even bothered us about the time share presentation  since we own   weeks and are Gold Crown owners there was really no point we can not upgrade any furhter  we own the highest you can get  She was gracious enough to send us an Anniversary basket complete with Champagne  Glasses and various Las Vegas gifts  We never heard any noise from constuction  We did hear a few chairs being moved from the floor above us  We stayed in Lily Bldg  unit     A amp B  Cynthia also out of her own pocket bought us a gift for our Anniversary  I made a point of complimenting her to her boss who was very nice CONS  Floors were dirty  Seems as though they wash with cleaners instead of just plain water on those floors which attracts dirt like a magnet Parking was at a minimum and we frequently parked on the street running between the Sout Point and The Grandview  actually made it easier to get to our unit Blinds in the bedroom did not close all the way making it very bright in the room  We were so tired every nite we never had a hard time falling asleep The Walt was very close so we bought groceries  We rented a car and found it very easy to park at the casinos free and walk to where we wanted  The Southpoint does have a shuttle but only goes to the Mandalay Bay and you have to walk from there  Grandview has one running only on saturday  The Southpoint was great  Buffets were awesome  Sunday brunch was pricey but still cheaper then in town  We made the mistake of going to the Colorodo Grill while there  food was terrible and service was worse  We ended up getting     our bill taken off  The Primarily Prime rest  was fabulous  Food was cheap  for Vegas    of us for      eating Prime Rib that was as large as an average dinner plate and about   inches thick  We told someone one day we were org  booked into the Summer Bay Resort and they said that place was a dive  they heard horrible things about it  Told them we were at the Grandview and they said it was one of the nicest timeshares in Las Vegas so we were glad we re booked all in all we were very pleased with the service and rooms we got  
N =>   Loved the Grandview We were at the Grandview for a week earlier this month  We booked through RCI using points we have  We knew the location was not in the middle of the strip and we had read about parking problems  We never had a problem parking the car    always found a spot even later at night   might have to walk a little bit but not far  We loved the fact that the South Point Casino was next door  They had a great breakfast buffet for        can t beat that and their evening buffet was       which was not bad either   they also have other restaurants to eat at which aren t too expensive  We were offered the timeshare tour at Grandview and decided not to do it   no pressure  All timeshares try to get you to tour their facility  they are in the business of selling units  This was our first timeshare stay in the US    we usually go to St  Maarten or Aruba  We were surprised that no one came into the room the entire week  You could call to get a change of towels or wash your own  Each unit has a washer and dryer  The one bedroom was about the size of a studio in Aruba   but how much time do you spend in your unit anyway  We use it as a place to sleep  The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows  You do need a car to stay at the Grandview   but I feel anyone that does not rent a car in Vegas is cheating themselves out of seeing Hoover Dam  Red Rock Canyon  and Valley of Fire which are all spectacular and well worth driving to see  They were the highlight of the week and not the man made hotels trying to outdo the other  
N =>  Horrible service  When we arrived there they sent us to the  quot VIP quot  check in  I believe they thought we were suckers  That is where they tried to make us sign up for a   hour ordeal to sell us more time shares in this hotel and in the end they ll give us discounted tickets to local shows  After telling us all this we find out that there was a mix up in our reservations  They put us in their waiting room so they could fix it I ended up falling asleep in there because we waited so long Turns out that they forgot about us  We had to find someone to remind them that they left us in the freezing waiting room Finally they gave us our room key  but only one of our rooms was ready for check in At first glance the rooms are nice  but the closer you look things get ugly The shower was disgusting  There was mildew all over the bottom  on the tiles and shower door  The shower head was tiny and the water pressure was way too low  Mind you they give you a shower large enough to fit   people in it Our bed was absolutely disgusting  I couldn t believe it  There was hair all over one of the blankets  I didn t discover this until about   days before our check out  I know for a fact that they weren t my hairs and we certainly didn t have anyone else in the room I LOVED the lights shining so brightly in our room all through the night  The blinds did a terrible job of blocking out light in the bedroom  but in the living room they had heavy curtains that made it dark constantly The parking  You would think with all the rooms that they had there that they would provide at least one spot per room  It was horrible     am and parking on the streets  The parking was the worst part of our stay  
N =>   Long Time Owner   First Time Stay We got this timeshare on our honeymoon in Vegas in      We didn t get a chance to stay there until       It was a bit of a hassle actually booking our room  but we finally got it on a date sometime around our aniversary  We had to bring our son  but fortunately my mom came along to watch him  so my hubby and i could have some time alone  My first impression of the room was that it was better than i remembered it from      I was very impressed  but as the week went on i started noticing little things  like the wear on the furniture and the scuff marks on the bed spread  Also  when we ran the jacuzzi tub some gook came out of the jets  Still I tried to make the most of it  What I really wasn t feeling was some of the noise  The first night we got there the radio in the room next door just came on full blast in the middle of the night  it took a good hour to get someone from the staff to come up and go in the empty room to turn it off  turns out some jackcrack had set the radio alarm to go off with the volume full blast  what jerks  then off course there were the folks above us  who seemed to be moving furniture everynight between   pm and   am  that even annoyed my hubby  who is usually pretty laid back  and of course there was the not really  but pretty much manditory meeting they had you go to so they could try to upsale to the owners  we were there for most of a whole day and  even though we did end up upgrading  it was mostly a waste of time to me  all in all the  quot resort quot  was pretty decent  i mean there s no way you could stay in an equivalent hotel in vegas for that amount for   people for a week  plus i liked that the south point casino is right across the street  so a couple nights we didn t even have to drive all the way down vegas blvd to the strip  we just walked across the street  also the restaraunt across the stree was really good and they give a     discount for those staying at the grandview  so all in all it was worth it  
N =>   Loved it  Had a   bedroom for   people  That gave us   condo s  and it worked out great  Having   kitchens    bedrooms    bathrooms gave us room to spread out  The condo was well equipped  beautifully furnished  and immaculate  Being across the street from the South Point Casino was a big bonus  We liked gambling there  and the casino appealed to everyone in the group  It also gave us flexibility to come and go as we pleased and to not have to always be there as a group We had a rental car  so it was easy to visit the Strip or to run out to grab a bite to eat  If you are going to stay off the Strip  definitely recommend getting a car  Not sure how cost compares   we used RCI points to book  The only negative is the construction that is going on as part of the complex   the noise started at      am each day  so this would be frustrating if you re not an early riser  
N =>  Great vacation   My husband and I spent a week at the Grandview                   Overall acommodations were above average  Our unit was a   bedrm in the Primrose Bldg  Unit offered all that was needed     bed linens could have been upgraded somewhat  Enjoyed the pool area  South Point Casino across the street was great  Good food  lots of gambling options  movie theatre and shows  We rented a car for the week so we picked up Groceries at Albertson s which is about a     minute drive East on Silverado Drive  Strip is about     miles from the Grandview  Not sure about the bus system as we didn t have to use it     however we heard good and not so good reviews Staff at the Grandview were very helpful and friendly  We were not pressured into a time share presentation  we were asked if we would like to sign up for a  quot complementary breakfast   time share presentation quot  for the next moring after we arrived  We politely declined and told them that if we decided that we wanted to do a time share pres we would be in touch with them      that took care of that The business center in the main bldg leaves a little to be desired as the room is shared with a childrens craft center  There are only   computers and always a line of people waiting to use them    room tends to be noisy  However  having said that we did use the computers and managed to get our work done    not a hugh problem If you return back to the Grandview late in the evenings you may have to park out on the street as there are not enough parking spaces around the buildings   Parking in the street was not a problem for us  car was safe enough Overall  we had a great vacation in Las Vegas and would return to the Grandview again  
N =>    Year Anniversary In celebration of our   years of marriage my wife and I decided to stay at the Grandview Las Vegas  We stayed the first week of il  Let me first start by saying we will definitely be coming back  The room was great  Felt like home away from home  We decided to hit the grocery store around the corner to stock up on a couple of things  so we did not have to eat out every meal  A great location right down from the strip  but if you want to gamble the South Point meets all your needs and is a stone thows away  I loved the low limit tables  along with the variety of slots   Something for everyone  I did use the work out room  it is not that big  so I suggest getting in early  The pool was a little cold to swim in but it was nice to just lay out  The property is having some work done but it did not interfere with our stay at all  All and all we had a great trip and look forward to a return trip  
N =>   First Family Vacation So our first family vacation was in Las Vegas  Not a typical vacation spot for a   month old baby girl  but nevertheless  she did enjoy herself The Grandview offered great accomodations and beautiful suites  I did read some negative reviews about the early morning construction and parking difficulties  but we did not encounter any such problems  The staff was efficient and friendly  the rooms were clean and well stocked  Our middle of the night arrival was met with friendly faces and no pressure to purchase a time share  We needed a play pen at   am for our little darling  and it was brought up to our room in about    minutes  It was great to have a full kitchen when you didn t want to go out  because let s face it  it gets tiring  The outlet mall was very close to the Grandview and we enjoyed a couple shopping days during our stay  We did rent a car  which made it easier to get around  so we did not experience any shuttle rides  If you re travelling with a family  I do recommend renting a car and reserving  in advance  a child car seat  Most car rental companies offer car seats on a first come  first serve basis I would definately recommend the Grandview to young families travelling to Vegas  The amenities offered made it so much easier to travel with a baby  
N =>   Pretty good place to stay if you want to stay off the strip    Let me begin by saying that I really trust the people who are taking the time to write reviews of the places they have stayed    I rely on them quite a bit when making travel plans   so I take it very seriously and want to provide as objective feedback as I can   We stayed for a whole week at the Grandview  they are a Vacation Village property and it was funny when i realized we actually stayed at a sister property in orlando a couple of years ago this resort really reminded me of that one   Our villa  a   bedroom  was very spacious and everything was NEW in fact the guy who checked us in said the building was only   months old  The villas are very nice   we did a timeshare exchange within RCI to book this place and it is rated a Gold Crown resort and i think it is a doing a pretty good job of that   although we also own a Westin timeshare that is really what i would consider   star Overall our experience was good but there were a few things that could have made it even better    children s activities list was not updated and there was confusion day to day as to what was going on and when the resort claims to have an RCI office on site and they do have a space with an RCI sign on it but no one from RCI was ever there  not a big deal if you are not an RCI member but i was hoping to get to talk to someone just to ask some questions  the complaints about parking on some of the other reviews were not experienced by us   we actually found no problem with the parking there was construction going on right next to us while this did not affect us during the weekends  mon fri  we were awakened to the sounds of construction  this is really picky i know but their towels were awful they kinted all over the place   very annoying when you wear anything black  the livingroom curtains has the  quot hotel quot  shades so that even when it is daylight you can make it feel like night   for some reason  they didn t put these in for the bedroom and alot of light comes through because all they have are blinds in the room   we were facing the I    freeway and there is a huge neon sign advertising the casino next door that we just could t block the light    it was fine for me but my husband needs complete darkness to sleep All the kitchen stuff is new and in good shape  There are grocery stores within minutes  driving   The buffets at the South point Casino next door are pretty good for the price   although i doubt you would want to go more than twice     The resort does try to get you to come in for a timeshare presentation and when we declined they were fine about it    they tried one more time but that was it The pool area is nice and for this time of year it accomodated everyone that wanted to be there   as it gets warmer  i think it may seem a little small  it would have been nice if the little market next to the pool would allow you to put things on your room bill same thing with the kids activities   they all want you to pay separately   just need to make sure you always have money with you Again   I think this is a pretty good place to stay   it is away from the strip and it is good for families for sure   away from all the hub bub of the strip  It is also conveniently located a minute away from the I     I hope this was helpful  
N =>   Great Place           Enjoyed our stay  We stayed at the Grandview in Mid ch and did not experience any of the issues that past reviews had talked about  We stayed in  quot Iris quot  and had a great   bedroom unit that appeared to be very new and seemed to be very clean  The first night we had a little noise from some kids in the whirlpool tub next door  but as the sign asked  they were quite by      pm  The rest of our stay we didn t return until midnight or later and we had no problem finding a parking space  Granted  we didn t get the front row  but we found parking in our building s lot  Since  we had a car we had no problem that Grandview is a few miles from the Strip  It is so convenient to jump onto I    and go to the Strip or Downtown  All of the Casino s have free parking  We didn t want to deal with Valet  so we just parked in the  quot self parking quot  ramps or lots that each casino had  Never had a problem and it was quick and easy  I would recommend not dealing with Las Vegas Blvd  The best way is I    to the cross street you need  such as Tropicana or Flamigo  If you go Downtown  just follow the signs  The casino next door was great  It s new  spacious and the food was good  The only complaints about our unit were  the hot water was too hot  If we had kids along it would have been dangerous  Also  we would have liked to have seen some efforts in recycling  No indication of a place to recycle cans  bottles  etc      We had a great stay and would stay there again  
N =>   Cheap Stay Large Rooms No Parking Several Problems I found the Grandview to be an incredible value and was willing to accept many of the limitations that I had found from researching it  I was able to book it for     night  with a   or   night minimum   directly through the hotel   quot It was about   miles south of the strip  quot  No problem  I had a rental car  It took       minutes to get just about anywhere on The Strip   quot It didn t include daily housekeeping  quot  No problem   quot Parking might be a problem  quot  What an understatement When I booked  I was supposed to get     AA miles per night  I entered the code provided and my AA   The miles never posted  and so far I haven t been able to get them The suites were large and functional  with a full kitchen   We didn t utilize the kitchen much  The suites are     sq  ft   which is huge for almost anywhere but Vegas  In Vegas  they re just  quot big quot   Many rooms in  quot normal quot  Vegas hotels are in the         sq  ft  range  so it s not that much bigger  It was far more  quot plain quot  than most Vegas hotels Parking was a problem  particularly after about   pm  On most nights  I had to park quite a ways from the building I was in  On one night  I circled the entire complex for almost an hour  and there were probably a dozen others doing the same thing   There were NO parking places anywhere  An RV was parked  taking up FIVE spots  Many were parked on the street or illegally  I wasn t going to park on the street  I wasn t going to park at the hotel casino next door  I wasn t going to park illegally or in a  quot check in quot  spot  Nothing opened up  I parked at  quot check in quot  and went in to the lobby to complain  I told them about the RV  They said it shouldn t be there and that they would take care of it  I continued to circle  Nothing  I finally squeezed into a partial spot next to the RV  which was taking up about     of the spot   The next morning  the RV was still there  They never did anything about it  It was in the same spot for several days The Jacuzzi tub in the room would have been nice  but there were signs up saying not to use them after   pm  Who s in the room by   pm On checkout day  about    minutes before checkout time  I was just finishing packing  I was waiting to put my clothes on until the last thing so I wouldn t wrinkle my clothes  The housekeeper barged in  without even knocking    How totally unprofessional I will still consider The Grandview on future stays in Las Vegas  but only if I can t find anything else for even close to the same price  
N =>   Off the Beaten Track This property would not have been my first choice in Las Vegas  It s about     miles from the southern most strip hotels  Mandalay Bay  Tropicana   But  I was amazed to see the growth out there  My stay was for business and the rooms served well for our small group meetings  We definitely needed a car for evening dinners  etc  The beds  pillows  linens were not what I would expect of a timeshare  My expectation was higher than what was found in my room  riott vacation properties provide much higher quality appointments all the way around  Overall  it seemed as though The Grandview was built quickly  cheaply  and was appointed with economy low moderate furnishings  beds  and linens  Renovations  then  will need to happen sooner  if to remain competitive and attractive Taxi service is hard to come by  I needed a cab to the airport and was told to go next door to the neighboring casino hotel  Following their advice I went next door and waited    minutes for a cab Will I stay here again  Hmm  not sure  I d opt to stay in other locations first  but I might consider it  if the rates are suitable  
N =>   Easy problem free beautiful place to stay  I recently stayed at the Grandview for a   day  quot Girls weekend quot    of us shared a   bedroom suite and have no complaints about the facility  The rooms were amazingly clean and well stocked with anything we might need Since we were   girls  noone even approached us for a sales pitch One of our parties flight was significantly delayed and the staff was very accomodating with her next day check in into our suite Coffee was supplied to us for free for room use  and there is also a continental breakfast type layout in the lobby in the mornings We loved the tub  and even with   girls at the bathroom mirrors  we did not feel crowded We spent a fair amount of time next door at the southpoint casino and can find nothing bad to say about it  it was nice to be able to walk back to our room in a few moments at  am after a significant amount of alcohol So the downside     the pull out couch is completely uncomfortable  however the couch when put together is more comfortable than my bed at home City provided shuttle service is not as reliable as it is made to sound  but we were happy to pay        for a taxi to the strip to get there fast  And we decided that we had still saved money with the low cost of our room at the Grandview   we would have spent an extra      to stay in one of the  quot strip hotels quot  and did not spend that much in taxi fare Overall  we were impressed with our stay So much so infact  that I have a trip with my husband and children planned in the near future and have already booked our Grandview stay  
N =>  Not impressed My husband and I stayed at the Grandview from                 We had booked at the Grandview by exchanging a week with RCI  Check in was done efficiently even though it was  am  The receptionist was super friendly and helpful  The next morning our phone rang and we were asked to come down to the main desk  We were greeted by a young man who wanted to invite us to an introductory breakfast and for that he would give us a      coupon for a meal in Vegas  We were immediately suspicious and asked if this was a time share presentation  He said no just an overview of what was going on in Vegas  As we were unfamiliar with Vegas  we finally agreed to go  We asked several times  quot Is it a presentation  quot   Several times we were told no  When we showed up for the  quot breakfast quot  we were met by a representative who was about to take us on a tour of the property  We said we thought we were attending a breakfast meeting  She informed us that it was a time share presentation  At that point we said thank you but no and walked away with a bad taste in our mouths  Our   bed suite was mainly acceptable  although not up to the standard of our ownership resort  My major complaint was the dirty bedroom carpet   not fit to walk around on in bare feet After paying     for the taxi ride from the airport  we had been told by the Grandview staff before we arrived that there would be a shuttle available   not true  we decided to rent a car  There was rarely any parking at our building  but we were fortunate to be close to the main office and so parked there The closest grocery store is a couple of miles away and as we were attending a conference and time was tight  we just walked across the street to the South Point Casino complex and ate breakfast at the Buffet there  It was cheap     a person  and there was a good variety of food Before leaving we spoke to the Guest Services Manager and explained what had happened about the mis represented time share presentation  He had us fill in a customer satisfaction report and finally gave us back the deposit my husband had given for the  breakfast  we didn t get  We also returned the  free  bottle of wine we had been given  We loved Vegas and would go back there  even though we are not gamblers  but would NOT stay at the Grandview  
N =>   Great Resort the Price   A Definite Keeper   Arrived at the hotel on Saturday evening  Check in went smoothly  No harrassment about a resort timeshare presentation  so I guess the trick to avoiding that is a late check in  Room accommodations were more that expected for the price  Priceline was a great value at under     bucks a night   Keep checking back if you don t initial price first time  Hotel had come up unavailable on several prior searches but got online on a Saturday morning and there it was for a great price    could not believe my eyes Living room kitchen well equipped  Jaccuzzi tub was heavenly  The bedding could have been a little more comfortable for a resort  I am a Starwood owner and I guess I have been spoiled by the Heavenly Beds that they have at their properties Parking was fine each night we arrived back to our room and most nights we got back to the resort not earlier than    pm  The only problem we had while there was our circuit breaker kept going out a couple of times  So we would have to call maintenance to come reset All in all  a wonderful stay  Would definitely stay again  I have already recommended it to everyone that I know  SO  believe all the good reviews and take the bad ones with a grain of salt  
N =>   Do Not Stay Here If You Want To Park Your Car We booked this hotel through my mom s RCI time share network  It was free for us for a week The room was a nicely decorated   bedroom with a jacuzzi tub and sleeper sofa with full kitchen and washer dryer in unit  That is the positive side of things Upon check in they make you go to a  nd staff member salesperson  for a  quot parking pass  quot  Here they try to get you to sign up for the time share breakfast presentation under the ruse they will give you     off tickets to certain shows  When I told her we were set for our show tickets she turned nasty and rude to me  We were out to Las Vegas with our   young children to visit friends and the area  Every night we returned to our building there was not   parking space in the ENTIRE complex of approx    high rise buildings  My husband would have to drop me and my sleeping kids off at our building and walk in approx      mile from the closest parking spot  My kids were upset and crying that he had to walk so far and alone in the dark  I truly believe they are too worried about selling time shares than accomodating the guests that they have  The location of this resort makes it nearly a necessity to have a car to get anywhere  The resort takes an occasional trip to   specified place daily  but no shuttle other than that  I also phoned in ahead to make sure the pool was heated as i was told it was  When my excited kids got to the pool  it was frigid  dirty and had tree branches lying in the bottom of it  My best part of our entire trip was when we left the resort for   days and drove to San Diego and stayed in wonderful accomodations  The staff here just stared at everyone when you went in to complain about the parking situation  It was every single night  not just one exceptionally busy time  Our unit also overlooked the construction site where even more building is taking place where they can t accomodate parking  Upon checkout  no one asks you how your stay was they truly don t want to know  I did read the reviews ahead ot time and should have listened  I figured how bad could it be for free  STAY AWAY  I would have much rather paid top dollar and stayed somewhere that was concerned for you and your family s comfort  
N =>  Awesome place    I love this place  and so did the rest of my family  We rented   side by side   bdrm units  using RCI points  and it was well worth my RCI points  The place is far enough away from the craziness of the strip  but yet  close enough for us to go there everyday to walk and look around  The only problem  very minor  we had was lack of parking space  especially at night  But I m sure that will be resolved once the other buildings go up and more parking lots created  I can t wait to go back in the summer when they have the swimming pool and playground installed in the back  We stayed in the  quot Jasmine quot  building  which I was told  had only been opened like   weeks  
N =>  great hotel our family was there over the Christmas holiday  After reading many reviews about this hotel I was very hesitant about staying  but I had not control of our accomodations as they were may by a friend  Most reviews gripped about the sales people  amp  location of the hotel  The hotel was located about    mins from the strip  There are many restaurants within driving distance if you fancy Thai  Japanese or even buffalo wings  There is an Albertsons a couple miles away  When we checked in I noticed the timeshare sales dept was closed for the holidays  so I was very happy about that  The front desk was like a circus  kind of all over the place  But I admit the front desk was very casual  but friendly We stayed in the Iris building  The room was very nice  amp  the kitchen had all the luxuries of home  A couple negative things about the room were the walls were very small  I couple hear people talking next door at  am  amp  also when they dragged their chairs across the floor  Also sadly we could smell cigarette smoke on our non smoking floor  Our neighbors next door were smoking in their room daily  amp  the smoke was seaping into our room  We complained to the staff  amp  the front desk a couple times  Nothing as done  Also the bathroom door  in our suite  wouldnt lock properly  So it was easy for others to walk in when you thought it was locked  There was no turndown or maid service either  You have to throw your own trash away down the trash cute located on each floor  There was plenty to do for the kids within driving distace  like Shark Reef Mandalay Bay   M amp M World  amp  Ethel M Chocolate Factory  Just remember you are in Vegas so there is a LOT Of cigarette smoke so its not good if you have small kids or asthma  One big disappointment was many restaraunts were closed on Christmas Eve  amp  Day on the strip  Over all  a very nice stay  
N =>  Mixed Reviews Our flight was delayed and we did arrive at  am  The agent was very nonchalant  She didnt provide any explanation about the resort and placed a bunch of papers in our handsand sent us to a room that was not cleaned and appeared to either have an occupant  or the person just left   Thankfully no one was in the room or that would have been a mess  The agent who checked us in seemed annoyed but a guard was accomodating and bought us a new key to our new room That night was cold and we had no heat or hot water  The room was freezing  Maintenance worked hard to replace a broken heating system which took a considerable amount of time  They offered us no concessions for our trouble and needless to say  quot WE ARE OWNERS  quot  The hot water came on afterwards  Just be prepared that you are a distance from the strip and the so called shuttle is run by vegas com  It doesn t come regularly and you will have to wait a considerable amount of time  Also  try not to book your tours at the Grandview because they get a big commission for making a phone call that you can do on your own The room was spacious and can house   people comfortably  Any more than that would be crowded  Dont bother going on the free tours that they offer it is a waste of time if you are limited  They are trying to sell more spots and can become pushy I think they need more accomodations for guests such as shuttles  info etc   Otherwise the staff was friendly and accomodating  
N =>   okay but not great Big complex  on Las Vegas Blvd  about   miles from main strip Easy access to most things Check in okay  usual  quot have to get parking pass  from another clerk who is your time share host   didn t take too long not as pushy as some No luggage carts were available when we needed one  found them later after moving all our stuff  People seem to hoard them the night before they check out  Hallways and doors needed repainting  elevators dirty Heating and cooling worked fine and we had good view of the pool area and mountains  Kitchen was adequate  with usual coffee maker  toaster  dishes etc Room was okay except for when the people above us started their jetted tub  thought I was on a airport runway listening to a jet take off  Somehow they missed the sign that said no jetted tub after       PMThe bathroom lighting was way undersized for the vanity area  very dark and hard to see for shaving etc   the shower was a good size but the door didn t close properly  The towels were motel   ish Overall the place I thought was below average  not terrible but not as good as other timeshares we have stayed at  Especially since it is a relatively new  I would say a blue not a red trade for those familiar with RCI trading  
N =>  Service with and Attitude We stayed at Grandview from          until           Our room was outstanding and immaculate  The accomadations we comfortable and convienient to the South Point Casino  We wanted no part of the strip on this trip so it was very beneficial  As I have read in some of the other reviews  their customer service is lacking  We went to the front desk to get extra laundry soap to wash a few clothes before our return trip home  and were told to go to another desk to get it  When we went to the other desk  we were told by an associate that we had to wait in the line that had formed while we were waiting  so we left  They were rather rude about it  so we got laundry soap from a housekeeping attendant  We were not pushed on the time share  We arrived exhausted from a day of excursion  and had plans for our following eveing  they never mentioned the time share  Overall  the visit was wonderful  Be sure to check out the pool area  they have   pools located there  One was warm  one wasn t      
N =>   Beware of smokey rooms We have stayed at the Grandview twice in the last   months  Our first time we were greeted with ants in one of our units and missing silverware and dishes in both rooms  Housekeeping was called and they did not respond to our request   The next time we stayed here we were given   non smoking rooms  One of the rooms had been used as a smoking room  Since our previous experience was not up to the Grandview s standards we were given the hotel managers card to call if we had any problems  I called and let them know that smoke smell was very noticable in the unit  there were cigarette burns on the carpet and it also came complete with a clean ashtray in the cabinet  The hotel manager never called back to discuss our problem  When I checked out I was given a comment card to express my concerns about my non  smoking room  I did check and it was still listed as a non smoking room   These are the things that bother you about staying at the Grandview  It appears that if you have a problem that you would have to directly confront the managers at the front desk and wait until they do something for you  The normal channels do not work  The rooms are nice  staff is friendly on check in  yes  the elevators can be a problem and the tubs running late at night can be noisy  You just have to have a relaxed attitude coming here  since the management seems to have that attitude  
N =>   Stolen vehicle vehicle break  ins Do not Recommend  We are owners here  visited         Our car was stolen the first night  Reported to security  they said this was the first incident  it s never happened before  Our   year old daughter was with us and her car seat was in the stolen vehicle  We asked front desk about a car rental or taxi  so we can go purchase a new car seat  they sent us across the street to South Point Hotel  amp  Casino  They did nothing for us  We went back first week of          our car was brokern into the first night  Again  reported the incident  but did a little more investigating this time  We found  there have been many incidents happening here  I was very angry  spoke with property manager  I was told he would take to corporate office and someone would contact me  I asked Grandview to pay for my damages  I still have not heard anything from them  Do not recommend  They are still trying to sell timeshares  but they do not disclose the security problems  People need to be aware of the security problems going on at this place  Please contact me if I can be of any help csrfletes yahoo com  
N =>   Great Accommodations Just returned from spending a week at the Grandview for my husband s birthday and enjoyed every minute of it  We went with   friends and booked one   bedroom suite and a single   bedroom suite  We stayed in the Iris tower and everything was clean and new  The only unfortunate part of our stay was the cost of getting to the strip or downtown  We rented a car for three days  but should have kept it longer  And the other reviews that talk about using the South Point s free shuttle have obviously not been recently  A friend in our group asked the South Point about their shuttle and was told that in order to ride for free  you must present your South Point hotel key to the driver  So instead  we rode the trolley which wasn t bad at       a trip  There were salesmen trying to get you to buy a condo  but my husband said we simply weren t interested and we were never approached again  Yes  the walls are thin  but we didn t experience any loud noises or disturbances  Although  that might have been because we usually left the room early and didn t return until late at night  After all  you re not in Vegas to stay indoors all day long  The front desk and bell desk service was friendly  cheerful  and very helpful   We would definitely stay here again   but would rent a car for the entire week next time  
N =>  Just OK The one bedroom unit was comfortable  nice bathroom  The check in guy told us this was a new property  but parts of the building were already showing signs of age If you have a noisy neighbor like we did   moving furniture around in the middle of the night   it will be very distracting I wanted to check my email but you have to pay     a day or     a week for the privilege of wireless in your room  They have a tiny  quot computer room quot  in the lobby of the main building  but the three times I trekked there  all four stations were in use and the folks were not budging  Wireless access in the lobby is being discontinued   in fact they turned it off right in the midst of me sending an email Location was not fantastic  about   to   miles from the strip  but the hotel casino next door  South Point  is great  movie theatres  bowling lanes  lots of activities for families All in all  compared to other places I have stayed  I would not choose this place for my next visit  
N =>   No rest at this inn I was surprised at just how little rest I could get I actually had to move rooms on the third night due to the neighbors being so loud  thinking it was a once in a million irritation  I was moved This time I was bothered by the people above Anything on the tile floor is incredibly loud  and anyone running water  dishwasher  or clothes washer can be heard The rules on the noise  well they have none Kids can use the pool till midnight  giving no rest for those on the first floor but  you are asked not to use the jacuzzi tub after ten pm Having to take a bath before    pm  that isn t a hotel that is grandma s house Vegas isn t a city to rest in  so I suppose this won t matter to most But if you desire to sleep at all  go somewhere else 
N =>   It was great  We were there from     to         We were in Vegas in      when we bought this time share  We were unable to stay in it until now  We loved it  The place was immaculate  We stayed in a one bedroom and it was very spacious for us  The pool was beautiful  We went on a time share upgrade tour  No pressure at all and we got to see Carrot Top and got     in meal coupons at the Lexor  Can t beat that  We booked from Friday to Friday  We got there at       am on Saturday morning and our room was waiting  We left late Thursday afternoon so we had the room and pool all day too since we really didn t have to check out until Friday morning  The staff was great  One downfall is that some of the staff did not understand  speak English very well  but that seems to happen everywhere now a days  We will go back every year and stay here  We had our portable GPS with us so we were able to go anywhere we wanted to eat  We weren t tied to the strip to eat  If no one told us there was construction going on  we would have never known it  I would recommend this to anyone  We had a blast           
N => Extremely satisfying stay We couldn t have gone at a hotter time  but the hotel was marvelous  We liked the fact it was miles off the Strip  the rooms were cozy  frig  washer and dryer  TV  free DVD s to view  The noise level was picking up just as we were leaving due to construction on a new tower  but while we were there  it was quiet  The South Point was fantastic for food  the buffet and other places to dine were great  I used my mothers time share  we were approached on check in to go a seminar  which we canceled  and we were not bothered about it again  I can t say enough about what a pleasant experience we had  
N =>   Thin walls and broken elevators Stayed y     th   the rooms are really nice but but the walls are extremely thin  you can hear every noise the people above you make  moving chairs  filling the bath tub  having sex   it was really disturbing  not to mention the whole time i was there  there was only one elevator working   was quite frustrating to sometimes have to wait a     hour for an elevator no wireless internet from the room  gotta goto the main lobby and computer room for that  the computer room is nice though  nice laser printer etc   there is a large casino next door  South Point  that has cheap food and an ok buffet  but you are   miles south of the strip if you ant to have a real good time overall  it was easy to find and to travel back and forth from the strip  we had a rental car but with the elevator issues and the thin walls  cant say I would go back and cant say I can really recommend the place  
N =>  Locked out in Vegas Bottom line we booked a week at this resort And during the entire time there are door codes were in opperable on a daily basis We planned day trips to Grand Canyon and AZ and when we arrived the next mornings are suites and resort were unable to enter We even spoke to the resort Mgr Ms Valerio who stated that she would contact us and address the situation   To date our calls and e mails were un returned Too there is no true wireless connection there you have to use the public lobby to do so but while there you can here the staff be little thier customers   a great experience  
N =>   Beautiful clean and close to the strip but beware     Recently had a very last minute trip to Vegas come my way it was on a   day weekend so knowing time was short I was really wary of last minute prices as they can be high  Found the Grandview to be rated exceptionally high with very low rates  suspicious     I booked it and took a chance and was very glad we did  the room was fantastic so new we were the first to ever stay in it  clean all modern full kitchen  laundry in your room  a mini suite in pristine condition  However these are timeshares and this is why I say beware as a renter  non Owner  your are greeted warmly and well but then enticed into taking the tour they dangle Free show tickets at you  Free dining credits you name it and for    minutes of you time its a good deal if you want to save some money  but we were held in a room and handled by     people for well over   hours because they didnt seem to understand No Thank You  and this is why I say beware  its well worth the money to have such fine accomadations just know what comes along with the wonderful price of admission  
N =>  Beware of the Sales pitch We were hoping our first time there as official timeshare owners would be painless but that was short lived when they duped us into spending almost   hours attending an upgrade sales pitch  Anyone not expecting the sales pitch should beware The second night there we lost power to half of the   bedroom unit  They blamed it on a light bulb burning out causing the circuit breaker to kick out   huh       We didn t realize until the next day after they fixed the breaker that   of the outlets also didn t work  We reported that on Wed  and they still didn t have that fixed when we left the following Sat Although the sales person trying to sell us the upgrade told us there was Wi Fi in all the rooms we found that not to be true and the only place there was  was in the main lobby Excluding all the above  staying there was tolerable As the resort is still relatively new all was clean and tidy  Hopefully that will still be the case when they complete the additional    buildings towers that are in the works  
N =>  Great Las Vegas Location We spent four nights at the Grandview and I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was  I had read the reviews about how thin the walls were and was worried I would have four sleepless nights  Not the case at all  We had people on either side of us and didn t hear them  their TVs or their showers  We did hear a sound that was much like running water  but this sound was constant  it never stopped  After a while it was like white noise and we didn t notice it any longer  The bed was comfortable  The faux wood blinds weren t room darkening blinds  so it did get quite bright in the bedroom at      AM   we had an east facing room  The kitchen was well equipped and the bathroom was huge  We didn t use the Jacuzzi tub  but but it was a nice option to have  Being right next door to the South Point Hotel and Casino was nice  We walked over and had lunch and dinner a few times  We hopped on the freeway to get to the strip  it s so much faster than driving down Las Vegas Blvd  It took us about    minutes to get to Tropicana Ave  We used the guest computers and they all worked fine  I printed out our boarding passes and the printer was the fastest printer I had ever used  The resort is also close to the airport  Took us    minutes to get to the rental car return location on the day we left  This resort already has three large buildings open and they are in the process of building three more  It s a large resort and they strive to keep their guests happy  I felt that they took good care of us and would definitely stay at the Grandview again  It s nice to be close  but not too close to the crowds and craziness of the strip  
N =>  Worked for us    We stayed at the Grandview from ch      st and had a great time  The unit was roomy and we loved the big jacuzzi tub  It was so nice to be able to see mountains from our window  we live in Manhattan and are used to seeing traffic and buildings   The bed was comfy and we didn t have any problems with noise  The barbeque area outside was great  we used it a lot  although it seemed like there could have been more outside space given the intended size of the resort  The pools were fine  For the first few days only one was open and so it was pretty crowded and noisy  but after the other one opened all the adults sort of gravitated towards one pool and the children were in the other  so that worked out well The casino across the street was great  It is really RIGHT across the street  I thought we were going to have to cross Las Vegas Blvd  to get to it  but it s just across a small side road  It was fun to go over there and not have to go all the way to the strip The only problem we really had with the resort was our own fault  we went to the timeshare presentation  It was over TWO hours and the guy trying to sell to us was overly aggressive and insulting  We received good tickets for enduring the presentation  but honestly  it was such a waste of time and a negative experience that I don t think it was worth it  My advice would be to avoid putting yourself through this A couple other little things  first  you had to pay cash for everything  at the front desk and at the deli by the pool  which was annoying  but I guess to be expected since it s not a hotel  The room furniture was SUPER heavy and not the most comfortable to actually use  The table was a big round sheet of glass that wasn t connected to the base and I was constantly afraid of breaking it  The staff was odd  They were really friendly most of the time  but there were a couple of times when it was difficult to deal with them  We were trying to find out about the trolley and we asked someone at the front desk about it  he laughed and then said  yeah  I d get a cab  Umm  okay  thanks buddy  I had to repeatedly ask him until he finally  grudgingly  gave me a schedule  The deal with the trolley  by the way  is that it doesn t always stop at the Grandview  but it does always stop at the South Point Casino next door  so you just need to walk over there  Now  was that so hard to explain   Sounds like I have lots of complaints  but really these are just minor things  We had a great time and I would definitely stay here again  It was great being away from the strip  
N =>  It s not a riott    Stayed there the last week of ch  We didn t know what to expect after reading the mixed reviews  Check in was prompt   everyone very courteous with no problems  The unit was clean and neat but carpet in unit and hallways needed cleaning  This building is fairly new but very cheaply built  when opening kitchen cupboard door it hit a ceiling light  another light was hanging out of celing over tub  cheap shower head and no shelves in shower  bed ok but sheets very worn  cooking utensils missing and I called housekeeping for a skillet etc  They were prompt but only had one little skillet and said that is all there was   Very noisy when water turned on in other units  Unable to use wireless laptop in units  had to go to lobby to use  We were told no plans to do so in all additional buildings going up   Nicest part was having South Point Casino  buffet  etc next door  We have stayed at many riott time shares and believe me  this is no riott  they need to take lessons from them   
N =>   Inadequate security measures As owners of at this timeshare we were eagerly awaiting our first trip  we were pulled into a further timeshare presentation in order to secure tickets to one of the shows at discounted prices  The presentation went on and on  at one stage they stated the week      we purchased had no buying power to secure holidays in the RCI Brochure elsewhere  When we returned to our rooms and tried to access our safe the safe had been blocked  I managed to access my safe using a default code  The management told me I couldnt possibly have done this  I asked for my roomlock to be interrogated and discovered that an engineer had accessed my room unlawfully  I had     Dollars missing from my safe  The same story unfolded in the next room they had     Dollars missing  I recall on the same evening the On Call engineer being sent from room to room unlocking safes  The Management stated they had never had any similar incidents  however on an other occasion an engineer entered our Condo on the basis of changing Bulbs  The mangement have failed to answer our concerns and appears not to have any Complaints Procedure which is Tangible and transparent  They have simply brushed it under the carpet  
N =>  Beautiful Resort This was my husbands and my first trip to Las Vegas and WOW The Grandview was the perfect place to stay  not only was our unit clean  well maintained  spacious  and beautifully decorated it was the perfect distance from all the hustle and bustle of the strip without being too far out  A car ride takes about    minutes with no traffic  but had taken us as long as    minutes to get to the Aladdin with traffic  The staff was very accomodating  from allowing us to check in around noon to use of the corpoprate center well after midnight  to check out  The service never waivered Though we did not take advantage of the pool s  area  or the BBQ area  they too were clean  and inviting  The onsite snack bar was well stocked with just about anything you could need and the game room would have been tops had our teenagers come along with us  The jacuzzi tub in the room was great after a long day or evening walking the strip  however it is requested you do not use during the hours of    pm to   am  which is a bit inconvenient  but it is so you dont disturb your neighbors  The only complaint I had were the walls  and ceilings  are very thin and you can hear the ongoings in the adjacent apartment s   We would reccommend this resort to anyone  whether you are young or old  single  married with or without children  We will definitely stay again  
N => Fabulous Grandview at Fabulous Las Vegas  We actually stayed at the Grandview Resort by trading a timeshare week we own  We had stayed at the Mirage hotel   years ago  and I must say the Grandview was much more worth the money   Partly because the rooms are all suites and have full kitchens  but also because it s just far enough off the strip to be quiet all the time   It is a few miles from the strip  which means you need to rent a car or take a cab  but there is also a shuttle service which comes to the hotel periodically  The staff was also very helpful  amp  extremely friendly the entire time we were there  This is definitely a wonderful place to stay  
N =>  Timeshare folks too pushy  Hey Folks Just got in from Vegas yesterday  We had a blast  We spent  days  amp    nights  Fri Mon   We stayed at the Grandview Resort  The accomodations were ok  nothing too spectacular for a timeshare  Everytime the water was turned on for a shower or bath either from the room next to or above us the sound of the running water was extremely loud  as if the water was running in our room  The room also had an odor about it  We asked for a air freshener or something to make the room smell clean  no one ever accomodated us  The Grandview can t compare to Fairfields Grand Desert  The RCI salesperson was much too pushy  To be nice I could say he was on the passionate side when it came to RCI timeshares  But his passion turned into just plain rude and inconsiderate  The new South Point Casino is adjacent to the Grandview  The South Point was very well equipped for everyone  It has accomodations for the kids  A movie theatre  bowling alley  and gameroom  I say if you ve got kids just stay at the South Point Casino rather than at the Grandview  
N =>   quiet relaxation We booked the Granview through RCI and spent a week there  It was a wonderfully relaxing week  Of course  we were expecting the requisite timeshare pitch  but they didn t push it when we declined  like many other places  We had a one bedroom unit  It was spacious  We used the kitchen for many of our meals  We also had a few friends come to stay with us for a few days  and there was still plenty of room  We loved relaxing by the pools and dipping in the hottub  We rented a car  because we hate having to rely on other people for transportation  It was a quick      minute drive up to the strip  There is free parking at every casino  so there were no worries there  And if you just wanted to play a few games  without seeing the sights  the South Coast was next door and a very nice casino with LOTS to do inside We HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Grandview if you really want to relax between trips to the casinos  
N =>  Nice Place but no shuttle The Grandview is a nice place to stay  however  they use to provide a shuttle to the strip on a frequent basis  I was told by the administrative staff that they will no longer provide a shuttle at all  you will have to get a rental car or catch a trolley for       each way or       per day round trip  That sucks  
N =>   Good if you re not looking for quality       We stayed here for   days and spent most of it in our unit because it just felt that homelike  Night time in the units are a different story  The walls are paper thin and you can hear every little step the neighbors next to you are doing  In our case  we had a crying child  The curtains are fairly thin  so all the security lights from outside shined right into our windows  We also had the most uncomfortable bed ever  We actually found that the pull out bed was more comfortable  Although  this may just be an opinion  As far as the unit s amenities  I was quite upset to find that there was no ashtrays  even though we re not smokers   no batteries in the remotes  no coffee pot  and the washing machine and blender were broken  Even with several calls to the front desk  the only thing that was resolved was a coffee pot arriving days later by a gentleman that didn t speak English and couldn t answer any other questions I had  There was a very strange setup with the dressers as well  We found ourselves hanging things in the family living room next to the television because the entertainment unit is also part of a   drawer dresser and closet   very bizarre if you ask me  There is only one place to get food on site   it is a little cafe next to the pool  The food there was horrible   absolutely horrible  I ordered a sandwich one day   terrible  Later in the week  I was SO hungry  I broke down  went over there  and ordered a salad  Who can screw up a salad  They can   trust me  Even the front desk recommended not going there We didn t feel being on the strip was necessary  but to get there  you should get a car  Although trolleys are supplied pretty frequently  we didn t use them  Cabs are pretty expensive to get to the main strip   mainly because of heavy traffic  However  even renting a car found us looking for places to park   which most hotels have free valet  However  right next door is  South Coast   They have unbelievable restaurants and personnel  although somewhat expensive   All their slots were between a penny and quarter slots  Their high roller room was between    and     slots  I don t know about you  but this hit my budget just perfectly The last thing I can say about this place was how I couldn t get internet in the rooms  They say you can  but I had to go down the front desk area to get any sort of signal  I was so cramped  I actually ended up spilling my soda on my laptop and ended up having to use their computers anyway  Please make sure you don t need to do any sort of work that involves anything sort of concentration or lengthy attention because the computers are set to restart every    minutes along with the fact that you have tours going on every    seconds  It was quite disturbing to hear  And this is our internet room  but who works on vacation      times in a matter of a few minutes   not to mention the fact that I basically became a tour staple  I am going to leave you with the fact that although all these things didn t make me the happiest  I wasn t miserable  I enjoyed staying there   mainly because of South Coast being next door  Without them  the Grandview would be nothing  
N =>  Grand time at the Grandview My father  sister  and I stayed at the Grandview near the end of ust  We had a great time at this new timeshare  We also had never been to Vegas before  so we didn t know exactly what to expect  The rooms were great  very modern decorating  tile floors  etc  You could tell how new the property really was  The only noise we encountered was running water from the room above as well as the chairs on the floors  Nothing really to complain about  There are two small pools with more than enough chairs for sunbathing  On Mondays there is a welcome meeting with free juice  coffee  and breakfast goodies  The internet room was usually always full  but people respected the    minute limit on the computers  The shuttle was great  there really was no need to rent a car  Even though there are two shuttles as it gets later into the night  we found that they were full and people went to wait in line almost     hour ahead of time  This was frustrating but it is very easy to pick up a cab to bring you back  Always keep some extra money handy in case this problem occurs  On a tight budget  we bought our tickets to shows at the     price ticket store  The first one on the strip is in a giant coke bottle  We went to a magic show and to the show called Splash  Splash was a good variety show and highly recommended  Check out was easy  and we booked a cab to bring us to the airport and he was already waiting for us with his trunk open when we got to the lobby  Cab fare to from the airport is about      All in all  a great find  a bit further away from all the hustle and bustle  but in a relaxing and new setting which will definitely be buzzing with business very shortly  
N =>   I FELL IN LOVE I just LOVED LOVED LOVED  my stay at the GRANDVIEW AT LAS VEGAS  Everything was wonderful  The units are beautiful and the view I had was awesome  The resort as a package was really outstanding  I cannot forget to say the staff from top to bottom was so pleasant just great all around I did not want for anything I cannot wait to return hopefully I will be there again before the year is out  I AM IN LOVE  
N =>   Our week at the Grandview We stayed at the Grandview for a week      on by using our RCI points  I wanted to originally stay closer to the action but knew I was renting a car so I booked Grandview  I was pleased  I read a lot of the reviews on TA and I was unsure if I was going to ever get any sleep since a lot of reviews talked about the construction noise  I heard nothing  We stayed on the  th floor in the Sage Building  The room was very clean except for the carpet which had a few stains but I only looked at them   time while I was there  The couch however is HARD AS A ROCK so be prepared  Our internet worked fine and for printing I went over to the computer room and used the free computers there  No one ever called or approached us about any timeshare presentations  I bet it was because we already had a timeshare with RCI  I will say though that we stayed in NYC using our points and were hounded everyday to attend a presentation  The room like I said was very clean and the kitchen was nice so we did not have to eat out for every meal  The bed was comfortable and the AC worked great  One tip with the sleeping  in the bedroom there are only blinds no curtains so the sun shines in which is a drag  Luckily I read that information from another review writer so I asked for another blanket and hung the blanket over the window with some binder clips I brought with me  LOL  It worked like a charm and we slept like Kings   I will give you another tip which other reviewers were so right about  The noise from other rooms  I swear there has to be no insulation between the floors of these rooms as I heard the neighbor above us every time they got up from the kitchen table  I was prepared for that while we were sleeping as I brought a fan to drown out all of that noise  There are no ceiling fans so if you like a fan   take one with you  Any time we needed towels I just called and they were brought over within    mins with the exception of   time that they never came but I had enough anyways  The parking is tough at night  You can never park close to your building  As far as the strip  yes it was about a     min drive but as long as you have a car you have nothing to worry about  Valet the car at one of the central casinos and you are in the heart of it all  I would recommend Grandview as it was a good experience overall and I would stay there again  We went to see the show KA and it was pretty good  You have to keep up or you can not tell what is going on  As far as food    we went to Mesa Grill which is the Bobby Flay restaurant in Caesar s it was wonderful  Roy s off the strip was amazing as well  We also went to Envy to dine which was in the Renaissance Hotel which is just off the strip  which was so fantastic as well   Besides being hot as haydee s in y my   st birthday was a great time   
N =>  Great Place We just returned from a great visit at The Grandview  We have stayed in many hotels from The Bellagio to The Lady Luck and found this hotel to be excellent  The room was extremely clean  quiet and full of many amenities  We went to the Gold Coast for most of our meals  but you wouldn t have to if you preferred to cook in the room  We didn t notice the noise that some visitors have complained about  We rented a car prior to coming and were thankful for that  The hotel is pretty far away from anything else you might want to see or visit  We recommend this hotel very highly  
N =>  Not worth it Wow    So  I thought I was getting a great deal because I was able to get a suite for         a night over the weekend which is unheard of in Vegas  Thursday night I had stayed at the Venetian and then came to the Grandview in the afternoon  I am not a timeshare owner  simply stayed as a guest through an orbitz reservation  I found it quite suprising to find a timeshare on there renting out like a hotel  but I think I understand why now    Check in was great  I checked in early at  pm and they accomidated me without delay and got me in the room  sent me over to the timeshare area where I decided to sign up for the  quot lecture quot  and get a free stay in the future  I regret to say this was the highligh of my stay    oration  I do not know who did the decorating but the paint is horrible  It is this dark mustard color and there are no curtains around the windows or any other decorations  I felt like i was at a motel   or something  When we entered the room it was nice and clean    The Pool  Around  pm we decided to go down to the pool  Before going down we phoned the front desk to inquire whether or not we needed to bring towels and we were informed there were towels down there  When we arrived no towels to be found  When we asked a nice lady who was taking around Otter Pops to all the guests in the pool we were told you had to come down by  pm to get a towel because the man with the towels leaves after that  That is quite inconvienent since the pool is open from  am   midnight  It was quite a ways back to our room so we decided to forget the towels  The pools were rather small and shallow  deepest part  ft  But lets address the real problem the WATER  The water was as salty as the ocean from all the body sweat and not a trace of chlorine  We were so discusted we decided to get out and return to our room to shower    The Room The walls are VERY thin and if you are a light sleeper like myself forget getting in a nap during the day  Also the beds were quite hard and the pillows uncomfortable  It would also be nice if the toilet were more private  Other than those problems no complaints with the room itself   The Timeshare  So we went to the timeshare presentation which for anyone who has gone to one you know how it is  After we explained that we were not interested in purchasing the timeshare for various reasons  mostly we just weren t impressed with the property  they cont  to try to win us over by lowering the price to less than        which I will come back to later    Problems  there are only   elevators in each tower one of the   in our tower broke so there was one elevator for    floors of guests and no stairs to be found anywhere  Supposedly there are   shuttles to go two and fro the strip  one of which broke down so now you could only go once an hour instead of every    minutes and most of the time it ran       late some more like once every    minutes  A cab ride will cost you about      The handicap doors came off the hindge and was not accessable Well as I said before I did attend the timeshare presentation and did receive an invite to come back and stay for free for   nights  I will be forfieting this offer as I do not wish to return to this resort even for freeAs for those thinking about purchasing this Timeshare  please  PLEASE try it out to make sure this is what you want  As for myself  there were too many things that were quite suspicious    offered like a regular hotel through the internet   Sales must be hurting if they will lower the price by half in order to make a sale after prviously telling you the resort is selling so well they only have   units left that they can offer    This is a brand new resort and equipment should not be breaking so soon   If they cannot transport people efficently to and from the strip they will loose a lot of business from people Again to each his her own  but for me this place is definetly a disappointment to timeshares  
N =>  ried In Vegas  I was married in Las Vegas on            I chose to stay at the Grandview because I bought a time share there two years ago  At the time I bought the time share  it was still being built  so I had no idea of what the real place was going to look like  I was nervous about how everything would look  but I ended up having a fabulous time  The rooms were fantastic  They were particularly great for a honeymoon suite  the jacuzzi tub  wink  wink   They put all of our guests right next to each other  We cooked and hung out  plenty of room for everyone  We did have two rental cars  which was nice because it is a few miles down from all the main action  but I loved being out of the busy part of the strip  The resort was much more relaxing than being right in the middle of the strip  I thought  I m young  but the Strip wipes me out  and it was nice to have a relaxing place to go back to  The hotel staff was very accomodating and very fun  We were in good spirits and they joked along right with us  We checked in very quickly and they were always helpful if we needed anything  The shuttle was also fine  My husband and I want to go back every year  All of my friends had a fantastic time  as well  My brother became very interested in looking into a timeshare and asked a bunch of questions  I think it was clear he really liked the place  We planned everything in   weeks and I m so glad the resort was so accomodating  I can t stress enough how wonderful of a time we had there  And  everyone made money at the South Coast  right next door  Even though the South Coast wasn t as crazy as some of the other busy casinos  there again  it was nice to have some space  and just have fun gambling in a cozy environment  There were a lot of things to do at the South Coast that we didn t have time to check out  People were content to just go next door rather than go to the busy strip  The whole experience was great and I recommend the Grandview to anyone  Please let me know if I can answer any questions  
N => We Had A Wonderful Experience  My husband and I just returned from a long    night  weekend at the Grandview Resort  As owners  who bought   years ago  and had never stayed at a timeshare we didn t know what to expect  but everything was most pleasant  The reviews you have published helped us so much in planning our trip  We requested that our unit be away from any ongoing construction  and have a view  The staff was most accomodating  Our unit was on the  th floor of the Primrose building overlooking the pool area  The view was outstanding at night with the lights of the surrounding area visable  Our unit was quiet and the only time we even knew someone was next to us was when the common door was shut  but this was infrequent  The layout was very comfortable and we enjoyed the tub in the bedroom  and the large bathroom  We didn t do any cooking  but the kitchen was fully stocked  even had a corkscrew which we did use   We spent our late afternoons by the hot tub in the pool area and found it to be most relaxing We rented a car  so we were able to drive to all the areas we wanted to see  we usually stay on the strip and use cabs   Boy  is Las Vegas growing  we didn t even recognize the drives to Boulder Dam and Red Rocks  The Grandview won t be considered a long way from the strip for long  All the hotels and casinos have valet parking so we took advantage of that perk  and with only small tips saved our money for gambling and shopping and our feet for walking the sights  One small complaint we have would be that the map the front desk gives out needs to be updated  as many of the streets are not completed  but show to be on the map  We did get lost a couple of times  but Las Vegas is an easy town to navigate  Also  be sure and ask for your parking permit from the front desk  as the clerk forgot to give us one  and we got a warning notice the first night we were there We would highly recommend the restaurant across from the South Coast  It was most enjoyable with a very friendly staff and good affordable cusine All in all we had a wonderful time and hope to visit again soon  
N =>  Grandview My husband  amp  I have just come back from staying at the Grandview at Las Vegas  We checked in very quickly  amp  the staff were very helpful  amp  polite  When we got to our hotel room we were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room all I can descibe it as was a  b room apartment  Everything you would need was there a fully fitted kitchen B room faultless as was the rest of the room  Swimming pol  amp  spa areas were very clean  amp  tidy and the landscape was very pleasing to the eye  The hotel had its own shuttle service  free  and another shuttle service which you pay It dropped you off at the Tropicana Resort  amp  Casino  amp  picked you up ftom there to  Even though there is a  st Class shuttle service you really do need a car to get around  Some of the other reviews mentioned a smell we had the same thing but after a couple of days it was gone we think it might have been the bin shute located at the end off the corridor  There were Timeshare Reps there showing people around as it is a Time Share Hotel but we were never approached by them and it didnt bother us  There is also a caino called the SouthCoast right next door to the Grandviewwe thought that it was a added bonus as yoou might not want to go to the stip and just stay locally it is ideal  As they also have about   restuarants which offers a wide range of food and some are open all night to  All in All my Husband  amp  I had a  st rate holiday in a  st rate hotel  amp  we would love to go back and stay at the Grandview Hotel again    Stars for them  
N =>  Our Stay Was Enjoyable I read many of the reviews posted for the Grandview to get some idea of what to expect  I kept an open mind and wanted to see how my experience compared to some previous reviews  When I read some negative reviews such as those about the noise level and service at this resort  I took them with a grain of salt  but I must agree with the noise level comments  When someone was using the shower  it seemed to be magnified throughout our unit  There was also a note posted near the Jacuzzi requesting that as a courtesy to others not to use it between    pm and   am  so the noise level for bathroom time is a problem  I didn t notice noise from other people  We were on the   th floor of the Sage building so there may not have been anybody near us  As for the service  my only dissatifaction was with requesting fresh towels  I called housekeeping on Tuesday about       am and did not receive them until the next morning  I didn t ask how long it would take  because I  quot assumed quot  the towels would be delivered sometimes the same day  The person in housekeeping was very courteous and asked if I wanted two sets  so I thought this was going to be something handled promptly  The next morning I located a housekeeper to get some towels since I hadn t received the sets requested the previous day  She was pleasant  but did not speak English  so I tried to ask as best as I could for small wash cloths  She called someone  and he immediately brought some up to me  I took them back to the room  and got some washing detergent  each unit is provided a complimentary box  thereafter  they have to be purchased  from the housekeeper s cart  and washed our dirty towels because I thought I would never get any delivered  The fresh towels were finally delivered when the housekeeper for our area arrived about       am  For future stays  I ll just wash our towels for convenience  Now that I have gotten my two concerns out of the way  I still enjoyed staying at the Grandview  Check in was good  about ten minutes  and the bellman who got our bags as we got out of the taxi was very friendly and informative on tidbits of information about the resort  He left us a card with his name and number  We never got back to him  but it was nice being offered that courtesy  We didn t use the shuttle  but elected to rent a car and parked at the casinos  It was more convenience with the car  South Coast was great to have nearby  Our son enjoyed all the kid stuff they offered  It was great to go next door to eat and enjoy some entertainment  We never had that secluded feeling that others experienced before South Coast was completed We went on the resort s presentation Sunday morning  It was not high pressured  but it took longer than I thought it would  about an hour and a half  They put us through the paces and kept trying to get the absolute final offer to us before they let us go  They provided finger foods and sodas  plus we got Lance Burton tickets for     each  We ve been on many of these things  and this one was not bad compared to others All in all  I liked the Grandview and would stay there again if RCI with it s timeshare maze will have units to exchange  We rented our unit through RCI this trip because they didn t have any for exchange  I still don t understand how they have the unit to rent  but not to exchange  It s part of what I call the timeshare shuffle  Also  at the presentation we were told that in the future to exchange to Vegas  all resorts will be on the points system and not the weeks system  Yet again  another way to get more money out of the consumers  What s next after points These business people are constantly thinking of ways to get more money from the masses  Thumbs Up to the Grandview  I hope it will only get better when all twelve of the buildings are completed  
N =>  Wish it were closer to the strip A friend at I stayed at the Grandview         I exchanged a week but we stayed only   days   We had a   bed unit that was very large  We were in the first building  across from the reception building  Our unit had a good size living room that doubled as the other sleeping area  The fold out bed  my friend said  was not too bad  There was a huge tv across from the sofa in a built in cabinet and next to that was a closet area  That was handy for if you have someone using that area aside from the bedroom  The living room also had a DVD player  The small dining room was an open area between the living and kitchen  In this area was a credenza that had a small cd boombox that we used a lot  The kitchen was great  except for electric cooking  and was stocked well  The bathroom was huge and had   sinks on a huge vanity that made it easy for   girls to get ready at once  The shower was huge but did not have shelves or a seat or anything  it was not conducive for girls showering with their toiletries or trying to shave legs  The master bedroom was very large and had it s own tv  The bed was comfy  There was also a huge jetted tub in the master butting up to the bathroom  There was a large closet space in the bedroom We didn t notice a lot of noise from the lock off that was next to us but you knew when they were coming and going just by hearing doors open and close  We had a view of the pool but it was cold and windy during our stay so we didn t see many people there  I did get a sandwich at the deli and it was ok  I wanted pizza but they were out and then I wanted the cheese sticks but they were out Reception was very nice and helpful  They even gave us passes to some of the new nightclubs in town  They have an internet room down there but I had my laptop and had to use dial up in the room  I later found out you could bring your laptop down to reception and get their wireless  We did use the shuttle service ONCE  It was horrible  First of all  it s a van thing that seats like   or    people with tiny butts  We had   in there seated ok and he wanted to cram more in we were like  quot no way quot   And our driver was literally crazy  He was trying to be funny and make jokes and a passenger was being sarcastic and the driver didn t like that and pulled off the road on the way to the strip and then we couldn t get back on the road due to heavy traffic and had to go the back way through the barrio  His name was Billy  If you get in the shuttle and the driver is Billy  GET OUT  AFter that we relied on taxi s and the Strip Trolly  A taxi will put you back about         to get to the strip  So  for that fact  I would have to really consider Grandview again  too far from the strip  But everything else was very nice I would recommend a car when you come to this resort just so you can get to a grocery store and go shopping  But if you are going to the strip  don t drive unless you valet all day at a hotel  But if you are drinking then do the trolley or taxi  Next door is a brand new hotel casino and we went in but it was somber and dull compared to the livliness of the strip casinos  
N => Housekeeping not acceptable Grandview  Las Vegas We arrived on Friday  ruary         and thank goodness we are leaving tomorrow  ch     Staff has been friendly  at least the few that speak english  None of housekeeping speaks or understands English  We understood we would get a complimentary room cleaning once during our stay  That did not happen even after   phone calls requesting it  Instead we were brought sheets and towels that were handed to us at the door  Now I have no problem making up the room but I do expect to get what I pay for   Needless to say this will be our only stay at this timeshare  
N =>  More Than Adequate Stayed the week of the Superbowl  More than adequate  Unit slept four  Clean and generally roomy Walking distance to the South Coast casino next door  It itself is brand new  opened ember       and pretty nice Exercise facilites were nice  However  it does not accomodate more than      people Did not use pool or hot tub  but they looked nice Downsides   Common door shared with neighboring unit is very loud   You do need to rent a car to see more than the South Coast   Same complaint as a previous poster regarding lack of decent internet service  I will not stay at hotels without free service in my room  The same should apply to timeshare units  especially brand new ones  
N => Disappointed at this new Resort We just spent a week at the Grandview  a trade  and we were not very impressed with this  quot new quot  resort  Check in was with a trainee of no personality to boot  For what we pay in timeshare prices and maintenance fees this was a big disappointment indeed  The sheets were very old and put on shabbily and inside out  so were they changed and clean  yuck  Shudder  The room counters and floors were filthy  Wear white socks for    mins  The DVD player didn t work  Mid week  quot maid service quot   well they took the extra box and tissues and left no toilet paper  Can you imagine having to call the front desk to ask for that and then find out we had no dish rags or towels  They took out the dirty towls and didn t replace the floor mats  The shower is so cheap  No where to place ones leg to shave  And the soap dish for which the soap slides on   on an angle   Shower floor is sloped toward the back so it hurts the feet to  quot dig in quot   Thin walls  Dishwasher needs jet dry  so our dishes always appeared dirty  Whose brillant idea was it to have a foyer with   doors so every night your neighbor cooks their  quot smells quot  drift in to your room  What a stink  We re there for vacation  Not to have an  quot apartment quot  feel  The couch was not opened and cleaned so our guests were very uncomfortable to say the least  We were very embarrassed  We will not recommend this resort to anyone  
N =>  Everything We Expected Thanks to the Reviews  We stayed at the hotel from    thru           It was a really nice time  I am glad that I was able to read the reviews here before we went  We almost didn t make reservations there because of what some of you had to say  but we are glad we did  It was really helpful to know about asking to stay in the Primrose bldg  instead of the Sage bldg  We barley heard any of the construction on the  th floor  We enjoyed using the gym area  you just need to get there early around      to get on any of the machines  They had   treadmills    bikes    elliptical trainers  and some various weight machines  The pool area was really nice  but every time that we wanted to go it was a little crowded  so get there early  I recommend that you have a car  All the hotel casinos have free parking so that was a plus  Also a lady was not too happy with the shuttle service  I believe she didn t like the fact that they were never on time  The rooms are really nice  Full kitchen to include dishwasher  stove  large fridge  Jacuzzi tub  and   piece master bath  It was great  I knew that the Grandview was a timeshare condo and we never got harassed to sign up for or buy anything  Service was nice and pleasant  But keep this in mind  if you need more towels  dish soap  or coffee  you probably should call room service well in advance  Because they are not real speedy on towel and TP service  I had to call   times Now the Internet room  Waiting for hours to get on the computers was ridiculous  I was told that there was a time limit per session  but no one was keeping them  it was frustrating to see kids playing games like solitaire     for goodness sakes  quot   We would definitely stay there again  actually we are already planning on it when the new casino next door opens        The Plummer Family 
N =>  Will be great next e    when South Coast casino opens Parking just closeby to buildings which is great if you ever driven and self park casinos hotels are long walk to reg and roomslike a   br rm condo nice inside except the water noise from jacuzzi above and if people moving furniture above on the tile floor besides that otherwise very quiet  they asked you not to use jucuzzi after   pm  maybe I m late sleeper since I stay out  too bad no high speed internet in rooms and they close the computer room at midnight  might have to talk to them about getting in after midnight  Shuttle runs every half a hour to Flamingo only till  am  It will get better next june    when South Coast Casino opens up  there will be resturants  it has a bowling alley and Century Theaters  If you can get a deal and rent a car cheap  its great  I know how to drive around strip and downtown now  There are more stores if you drive down first right at light going toward town  I have check all the timeshares in town  to get a deal bargain  There so many programs they can sell to you  I should be a paid advisor to people who want to buy a timsehare in Las vegas 
N => Grandview       to         Consider other s first If you want ammenities  this is not the place to stay  The Grandview has nice rooms  although lacks the upscale interiors of many of the other Vegas timeshares  but a complete lack of ammenities within the resort  When we arrived  each question was answered with an  quot I m sorry  we don t have that although they are thinking about putting that in  quot  Questions such as where is the snack bar deli   where are the pool towels  No outdoor bar at the pool  high speed internet in the room  bellhops  There is a definite lack of customer service on behalf of the hotel personnel and their salespeople lack any kind of professionalism  We found the following lacking at Grandview    No internet service in our room unless you brought your own cables  When we called they indicated that you had high speed internet available in rooms  They don t   it s dial up  Do have a room off main lobby that has high speed computers that cut you off after    minutes but it was always taken up by kids playing games  No deli  no snack bar  no towels at the pool  you bring your own from your room  no cleaning service mid week  They claim they do but when she arrived late in the afternoon she made the bed  replaced sheets at our request as they say in their book in the room they only make the bed  not replace sheets  and replaced   of the regular towels  No shampoos  no beach towels even though we had turned them in  No trash was taken  no wipe down of the kitchen counters  No cleaning of the coffee maker  which by the way does not turn itself off   found that out the second morning when I went to make coffee again  What they consider mid week cleaning for all of those that frequent time shares was nothing compared to what other more upscale such as Hilton  Embassy  riott  Fairfield do as part of their mid week cleaning  What we did find from the Grandview is that they use the cheapest products to furnish their interiors  The shower in the master bedroom had a fiberglass bottom which never got clean and had mold growing around it  cheapest soaps and shampoos  least of my worries though   They don t provide any lotions  shower caps  etc  like other facilities do  I also found their timeshare salespeople made completely false statements to the people touring  I wanted to correct them several times but have enough social skills not to embarrass them in front of their clients  The equipment in the gym was broken the entire time we were there  No towels are provided in the gym either  When we reported the treadmill problems    out of   were broken  it was reported that they had called it in  Never did get fixed a week later when we left  There are no bellhops to assist you with luggage  In discussing the facility with several people  all had the same concensus  This place looks nice from the outside but has absolutely nothing to offer on the inside  Our advice would be to stay at a Hilton  Embassy  Fairfield or riott Time Share before ever considering this place  You ll get a much better product  We ve done all the others and will not make this mistake again  
N =>  Love It Me and my wife visited the resort july    thru july     reading the reviews earlier i rented a car  a good choice i love the resort everything about the room  the service was first class with us  the only problem i had was when i went to get my parking pass  they kept trying to get me to take the tour to buy a timeshare there  grandview is my home resort  
N =>  Resort is nice service needs help The Grandview is a relatively new resort  so the rooms reflect this  However  there are some issues with this resort  First  the walls are extremely thin  which was mentioned by some previous reviewers  The first morning  we were awakened by people in the next room running bath water  It sounded like they running water in our tub  Luckily  they must have checked out that day because we did not hear that the rest of the week More importantly  the Grandview could use some lessons in service  I travel often for business  and I am very protective of my time  and have come to expect good service in places I stay  The woman that checked us in was helpful in finding us a room that did not face the construction  but seemed to be bothered that we were asking  We also had problems with bugs in our room  which is understandable for that time of year  We asked someone to come spray three times  The first time  we are not sure if they ever showed up  The second and third times  we know that they did not show up There is a shuttle that runs from the resort to the strip  and that was convenient  However  there were a couple of times on the change of driver shifts that the shuttle left later than it was supposed to leave  once was about   minutes late  the second time it was about    minutes late   And the second time  when the front desk was asked about it  they showed no initiative or concern that the bus was sitting out in front of the resort loaded but with no driver  They even got annoyed with one of the residents for asking the front desk about it  So if you going to use the shuttle  make sure you allow for enough time if you are on a time shcedule and have some place to be All in all  the resort is nice  but needs to work on service levels  It will be interesting to see the condition of the resorts in a few years  
N => Use your dead bolt door locks otherwise okay timeshare condo We stayed e    y st  At  am on our first night  we had a couple burst into our room  having used an electronic key card to unlock the exterior foyer door  and our room door lock  They were standing next to my son sleeping on the fold out couch  They scared us to death  We had rented   one bedroom units to accomodate my elderly dad and our family  so I had not locked the deadbolts  This was really unacceptable  and the front desk only said   oh so sorry when I confronted them  Customer service    The grand view is   miles or so south of the action on the strip  you need a car  It s quiet  other than the casino construction next door  and pretty new still  There are   pools  one is ice cold the other heavily used by kids  and good for kids  shallow  Bring sun screen there isn t much shade  There are very few resort activities Warning  when you check in they will send you to the  quot concierge quot  who is only a timeshare sales person  Don t go  We signed up then cancelled after our unwelcome visitors  Other guests told me they were very hard sell  and even insulted them when they said no to buying a timeshare  We got a steal of a deal through the military to stay there  otherwise I would not do it again The walls are very very thin  Good luck  
N =>  Stay at Grandview at Las Vegas We had an experience while staying at Grandview at Las Vegas Friday night    th  It was reported to the front desk when checking out Saturday morning and noted on the comment cards  We were told by the manager at the front desk we would get a call on Sunday  Here it is Thursday  and we have heard nothing  I in fact called out twice on Tuesday to talk to the manager and was told she was in a meeting  but took my phone number and was told that a call would be coming  We are owners at Grandview at Las Vegas and was very impressed with our experience  But about       p m I was woke up by a knocking on the door  It stunned me  as there is supposed to be a double lock on the entrances to the rooms  I looked out and saw a family standing in the foyer of the   rooms  I really did not get to concerned  as I assumed they were trying the wrong room and would figure it out  so I returned to bed  My husband by this time was awake and had turned on TV in the living room when he heard something  and went to check it out  At this time  a tool of some sort came in under the door and turned right up and quickly unlocked the door from the inside  He startled them and they took off  He called for Security  Nothing happened  Then called the front desk  and talked to the manager on duty  and they stated that the maintenance man on duty was the one that unlocked the door from the inside   I want to know how this can happen  The key given them should not have unlocked the outside door if it would not unlock the inside door  Furthermore  the maintenance man should not be going around unlocking doors without checking it out to make sure there was no one in the room  Needless to say what was a real nice stay  was quickly ruined as well as the rest of the night  As an owner  I feel we deserve an explanation  I am sure you would not allow such a statement to be put out on the sights on the web  but we can sure try if you do not respond in a timely manner  
N => Takes them a long time to respond  
N =>   Lusso low cost a pochi kilometri dalla Strip  
N =>   Loved the beds  Ok so the building is old  We stayed there in      and it was awful but we didn t pay for it since we were there on business and wanted to be close to the convention center  Six years later we decided to stay again because we were told that it had been remodeled and still wanted to be close to the convention center  Wow what a surprise  The beds were fantastic  the bathrooms were beautiful  the pool was new  and the staff was great  The location to the convention center can t be beat  I was able to walk there in less than ten and never needed a taxi  I did not care for the restaurant but it has been some time so maybe I will give it another try I was not there for pleasure but for work and it was all that I required  I look forward to staying there again this ember  
N =>  Not A Happy Guest I recently visited this Hotel it was empty on the way over from the airport the cab driver said  quot I didn t know anyone stayed there anymore quot   He was right I saw about   people there the whole time we were there  The walk to the strip or convention center to catch a bus or monorail in     degree weather seems long  I was hungry at about      pm when we got back to the hotel I called for room service and was told the kitchen was closed  They should have told us that when we arrived to stay  we were there   days  wed sat  We had to go to the hotel next door to eat  They should invest in some type of shuttle to the strip  The rooms were ok  It felt like a ghost town  We were not happy at all  
N =>   It could be be BIG We stopped off at Guitar Center  On of the guys  saw a flyer for a show that was happening that night at the Greek Isles   quot The     Las Vegas quot   The flyer looked awesome  So we thought we would check it out  It took us a while to find the place  and when we did  we didn t know if we were in the right location  There was a hugh light up sign in front  but it didn t say anything about the concert  So one of the guys got off and asked if there was any bands playing there tonight  Turns out we were in the right place Now the place is kind of small  but it s got a real friendly vibe to it  We went up to the bar  to get some drinks because we were early  It seamed like everyone there knew each other  It was great  Everyone was laughing and drinking it just looked like they were having the time of there life  We got our tickets at the box office  The place was quite nice  Although the place was pretty dead and one of the bands just seemed really rude  The show was good  It had an awesome sound to it and the lighting was good  It needed some small round tables and a cocktail waitress  I had over heard that the place just opened up  Given time  that place  quot     quot  is going to be BIG   Next time were in Vegas again will be sure to check out the next show  
N =>  Basic but nice I had read reviews about this hotel on the internet  There was more negative than positive  I was quite leary to stay  but since I had booked through a timeshare deal  I was somewhat obligated to go  I was pleasantly surprised that the facility was simple  nice  and clean  It is not an extravagant hotel  but will provide your basic needs  If you need a place to lay your head after playing on the strip or enjoying the many attractions of Vegas  this is your place  If you are looking for somewhere with many luxuries  then this is not the place for you  The staff was friendly and helpful  Did not eat at the restaurant and did not do much at the casino  There was some activity each night on statge  live bands to karaoke  Basic  basic  basic is the best way to describe this place  
N =>  Disgusting Nothing else needs to be said other than this hotel is disgusting  From pulling up into the parking lot and seeing the hotel in person  I have no idea how this place stays in business  I walked past the restaurant during normal business hours and it was dead empty  The sportsbok was   guys at a wooden table  The casino was no bigger than my living room and I was afraid to drink out of any glass I was given at the bar  This place should be destroyed  It is disgusting and anyone who stays there should look somewhere else  If this hotel charges more than      to stay in a room it is still a rip off  
N =>   Horrible     Need to knock the hotel down and start again We thought we were getting a deal to book a quickie wedding package  The joke was on us  Brown stains on the ceilings  wallpaper coming off of the wall  stained and broken furniture in the rooms  That was all in the first    minutes we were in the room trying to book rooms somewhere else in Vegas  I went down to the front desk and cancelled all of the reservations for the wedding party and guests  This place is horrible  The pictures that are on the website are deceptive to say the least  I seriously do not know how this place stays in business  
N => Rat Pack Good  Service Dinner Hotel BAD  We did not stay at the Hotel  We only went there for the Rat Pack  I agree with others    most of the  quot service quot  left much to be desired  I felt ripped off buying VIP tickets which included a copy of their CD and dinner  didn t even include the cocktail in the lounge that was advertised   The meal was terrible  The CD is ok  I would recommend the Rat Pack    but keep your expectations low  No need to dress up  The place is old and smokey  
N => Horrible Place Since Celine Dion became sick we were forced to find another show on short notice  The low price  USD     for   pax  for so called  quot VIP quot  tickets should have warned us The greek isles is a completely run down place  We did not take the whole evening too seroius otherwise we would have left  Non smokers be aware you will get smoke from all sides  When we purchased tickets the lady at the box office explained that there will be a non smoking section  The staff guding us to our table  way too small for   people and uncomfortable chairs  did not know about any non smoking section  Fortunately there were no smokers on our table The staff offers an upgrade to a  quot private quot  table for USD     The    bucks certainly go into their pockets  Although announced   hours the show was finished after    minutes already The only good part were the singers which had excellent voices and funny casual acting  We really enjoyed this evening because of the good mood which came over from the singers  If they were performing at a more glamouroes place this could have been an excellent evening The musical dircetor  a small fat bold guy  at the piano was constantly ignored by the orchestra which made him shouting on them for time to time  We wondered if this was part of the show or if this was real  
N =>  Horrible service I did not stay at this hotel  but I had a very bad experience  I was walking from the strip back to the Las Vegas Hilton and I decided to stop by to check out the casino  It was pretty late    am  when I walked in  As soon as I stepped foot in I was walking toward the casino when a rent a cop with a cheap toupee stopped me  He asked if I was staying at the hotel  When I said no  he told me to get the  quot heck quot  out b c that casino was for locals  Very horrible customer service if you ask me  I would stay away unless I was desperate for a room  
N =>  Great Stay The Greek Isles was great  I agree that there needs to be a few updates  but overall  we had a great stay  You re out of the hustle and bustle of  quot The Strip quot  traffic  yet you are still in walking distance  The price was right and the staff was great  After all the excitement of the strip  it was nice to head back to the G I  and play their slots  Should we ever happen to be back in Vegas  we will definitely make a return visit  
N =>  Will not go back My family and I saw the Tribute to the Rat Pack show here  had purchased tickets befere our trip   but did not stay at this hotel  The show was great  but the hotel was seedy  dirty  staff was extremely rude  Couldn t get a cab after the show and there was no staff to help with that either  We will not go back  
N => ok This hotel was not too bad  We had a cheap rate there  The room was nicer than we expected  but the location was pretty dull  Not really near anything but the convention center  decent value  
N =>   Througly enjoyed our stay As we were staying in Vegas for   nights   we wanted more than a hotel room and something that was free of gambling  at least for someof the time  and this property delivered The staff went out of their way to be friendly and answer any questions we had   As a HH gold member they also provided several little  quot gifts quot  of cookies and water  which were above what we normally recieve Any minor problems were quickly remedied such as missing pots or glasses My only minor criticism was that this is a slightly more dated HGV than some of the others i have stayed in but that was more than compensated by staff attention Well worth the slight extra in price rather than a regular Hilton room 
N =>   Great Place  Of the three places we stayed at in Vegas  my boyfriend n i enojoyed this place the most  The room had everything we would need for a comfortable stay  kitchen counter sink  small frig w  freezer  microwave along w  the normal admenties  The hotel had free washers dryers for their guest  you just have to buy the detergent    The room was a good size even though i booked the smallest studio there was available  the room looked great  not cheaply put together  w  it s own thermostat                         the cons wld have been that there was construction nearby and the parking garage was not attached to the hotel  nor was there a covered walkway  and boy was it cold outside the last two nites we were in vegas    the thermostat didn t have actual numbers to indicate what the temperature really was  but that was ok since it was very easy to use n efficent not a bulky window unit   and the toilet in our room was very slow n actually clogged up the last day we were there   but considering our stays at the other hotels and the general layouts of other hotels we visited in vegas the small inconvenience at the Hilton paled in comparison   if i was to revisit vegas i would definately book a room here again  
N =>   No problems   pretty good place to stay Our friends who have timeshare through the Hilton chain let us stay here for a night while we were in Vegas and it turned out to be not that bad  There was a nice kitchen area with all the necessities  which was useful  The jacuzzi tub was large and the shower area was clean  The bed and bedroom area in general were spacious and pretty comfy  The Sahara was within walking distance  The hotel provides a coupon book for various things like breakfast coupons  meals  etc  They serve Starbucks in the cafe downstairs  There was also a pull out sofa in the living room if needed  The room service was friendly and housekeeping was efficient  Overall  our stay there was nice with no problems  Hope this helps  
N =>   Great place near monorail We agree that the hotel was great  suprisingly so given some of the reviews  We also had a suite  upgrade    not sure why  and the two rooms were more than needed and fabulous  The key was how quiet it was  The room  the lobby  the deli  etc  No waiting in line to check in  no worries getting a bell service to check our bags when we left  no worries getting a taxi  A couple things to be aware    The deli closes at       and there no room service     It is an easy walk  probably     ft   on a small sidewalk past the parking garage to the hilton for restraurants  gambling and the monorail    Don t take the trolley from the Hilton    it is slow  Take the monorail    Tell your taxi driver from the airport to go not take the freeway  It is an easy shot using the back roads to the hotel  Our cab ride was     from the airport and less than     back  
N =>  excellent Vegas hotel We had a king studio  spacious for the two of us  This property is very clean  Comfortable bed  good water pressure in the shower  double sinks in bathroom  flat screen TV in the living room  normal TV in bedroom   The air conditioning worked great and was silent  We heard no noise from the hallway or neighbors  No complaints about this place  everything worked  The location is definitely not central     minute walk to the Hilton to catch the monorail  but that did not bother us  We usually stay at the Westin Causarina  but we booked this one with Hilton Honors points and were not disappointed  
N =>   loved it First of all  it s on the Las Vegas Hilton property but not attached  it s own seperate hotel but easy walking distance to the Hilton  Enjoyed the room very much  especially the hot tub  Friendly staff  a nice pool but small  used for sunbathing mostly  But would go back again  
N =>  Beautiful room but loud children in the pool on   afternoons We stayed in a beautifully decorated one bedroom suite with a kitchen and FREE internet  The suite was very clean  No organized activities but it is not necessary in Vegas  The cart to take bags to the room was not available without the bellboy  who was never available when we needed him  The  quot no baggage cart without a bellboy quot  was annoying as we had too many computers  bags  and groceries to wait around for a bellboy with cart  We had a one bedroom  very spacious  but it was a lockoff with a studio next door and we could hear the people next door when we were in the living room  The little convenience store onsite and the bar by the pretty pool are nice conveniences not all timeshares have  We liked the free acres of parking  including the covered parking  We used the Las Vegas Hilton to gamble in and found the block walk fine for us but more incapacitated guests complained about the inconvenience of the timeshare location  Very pleasant  helpful staff Noisy children on two afternoons ruined the ambiance of the pool  No staff corrected the children  who shouted  quot co quot   quot Polo quot  for what seemed like hours  We just left  disappointed our sunshine time by the pool was spoiled  Otherwise  we loved our time at the HGVC  it was our  nd time there  
N =>  Average and miles away We got here after a poor experience at another property  Room excellent  Taxi scarce  Staff super good  Price OK  Pool looked great  sorry  convention attendee so didn t get to lounge around it  I ll be back with family  If you want to be close to the strip  go elsewhere  
N =>  Not that great my shower was broken and never was fixed  also my toilet clogged  The maid service did a half way job one day  Beside that it was ok  it was nice to have a fridge and a microwave in the room  
N =>  Poor Maintenance  This is a nice property but definitely not one of the newer facilities  The location is OK for most things as it is close to the monorail and trolley if you don t want to walk or take a taxi  The main problem was that the  adjustable  shower head would only provide a poor cone shaped flow and could not be set to the standard multiple streams produced by most showers  This was reported to the front desk twice before any action was taken and after it was  fixed  it still would not produce multiple streams but just a better flow of the cone spray  Also the quality of the bedding is inferior to what should be expected in this type of a resort  Motel   linens and pillows    Overall a decent place to sleep at night but not what should be expected from a Hilton Resort  
N =>   nice but not the best for vacationers We stayed here for a long weekend in ruary       It s a bit off the beaten path  not  quot on quot  the strip  BUT it is right on the monorail and at the convention center  It s nice  but not as nice as I had imagined a  quot grand vacation quot  property to be  We went next door to gamble in the Las Vegas Hilton casino    walking back after gambling and drinking was a bit of an adventure  My only complaint worth sharing was the location     it wasn t as centralized as I would have hoped  although we were both up for walking   a LOT  We literally walked the whole strip  and took the monorail back   I wouldn t stay here again unless I was in town for business  attending a tradeshow at the convention center  There are better values in Vegas than this hotel  
N =>   CHANGE IF YOU CAN Our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations at the Hilton  was OK  but there were a few little niggles i have to tell you about  Because we put the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on the door  the second and third mornings the maid decided to make as much noise as possible cleaning the room next to ours   opening and slamming drawers  hoovering  running the bath for ages   while cleaning the rest of the room  in order to wake us up and hopefully get us out of the room so she could clean it  TOUGH    just because it was Christmas  I suppose she wanted to finish early   but we were on holiday as well    The third day i went down to reception and asked if anyone was staying in that particular room  I was told that there was someone staying in it   so they did their own cleaning did they   After that though  the noise stopped It got to be quite expensive getting to the strip every day   the monorail is not cheap  and taxis usually cost around     one way  Sometimes we walked to the stip  but some days it was quite cold  and we had to get alternative transport  When we were going back to the hilton at night  we still had to walk from the strip when we got off the bus  around a         minute walk    and it was very cold at nightIf you have the choice  stay at the one on the strip  There is a bus stop right outside   so much more convenient  and better when travelling back after a night out   
N =>  Great place to stay  We stayed there in il and returned in y  This time we stayed in a studio and it was spacious  We are not Hilton Time Share Owners  We don t belong to their club  We think this is the best place to stay in Vegas  for us   Close to the monorail  easy parking  Not good getting luggage in and out of car  but we took care of it  No complaints  no problems  very clean  
N =>  Loved the hotel We consider ourselves hotel snobs  We like our space  who likes a room which is narrow and contrived  We were in Vegas because I was turning     We are up wolrdly mibile  have money to spend  and fit    lossely translates to yes we are able to be mobile  amp  walk  we like what we like and will spend money not just on accommodation but on a variety of Vegas products like shows bars  restaurants  attractions  amp  gambling So now that you understand who we are    if you are similar    we stayed in a bedroom    Buckets of room    bedroon  jacuzzi  bathroon  kitchen and living space   BEDROOM  Kingsize bed  telly   arm chair   JACUZZI  No bubble bath supplied by hotel    or bring you re own   BATHROOM  Double sink  walk in shower   KITCHEN  Full fridge freezer  micromwave  washer driver  dishwasher   fully equipedWe loved it  We would walk down on Flamingo to they Wynn  And then get shuttle hot Brill hotel alll in all 
N =>  Two Thumbs Up  We stay at the Hilton             and were very pleased with our stay  We asked the check in lady if any upgrades to suites were available and she put us in a mini suite  no charge   in the north tower that had a great view of the strip  The room was huge and very clean and nice  The bathroom was very nice and had a huge tub with jets and another separate shower  We thought it might be inconvenient to stay off the strip but the monorail worked out great for us   took us everywhere we wanted to go  Only time we had to take a cab was when we went to dinner at the Palms  dinner at Nine and drinks at Ghost bar  highly recommend both     Had the brunch buffet at the hotel on Sunday morning  I would rate it as below average compared to the others I have eaten at hotels on the strip  Food was fine but the variety was lacking  Overall we had a great stay  
N =>   Great stay Everything was great from start to finish in this hotel  Check in was speedy  room was very nice  view of mountains great  room service prompt  The addition of the mono rail is imperative as the trolly ride to the strip was endless due to the number of people and stops made  Would definately return  
N => Glad we stayed here  We had reservations to stay at another property for   nights  which was one of those super cheap      a nights  We booked the last   nights here at the Hilton  so we could at least have something booked that we could trust  Thank goodness we did not stay all nights at the Budg O Motel  Our big mistkae was not to book all nights at the Hilton Grand  Our room was like a large aprtment  and had lots of luxuries we did not expect  It had a big whirlpool tub  and a seperate shower  The kitchen was big and had everything in it to cook with   There is a VCR and we rented a movie in the deli on the first floor to watch in our room  We felt very spoiled  and tried to forget the previous   nights  This place is a must visit  It is also walkable to the LV Hilton  nextdoor  where you can do the Star Trek experience  Pretty Cool  
N =>  sorry to disagree with all the good reviews    I just finished my stay at the Hilton grand vacation on Karen avenue  Let s get right to the problems    My plane was an hour late   sitting on the runway   after traveling all day  I was informed that my room was GIVEN AWAY due to overbooking  After much complaining  I was finally given a temporary room that smelled so badly of cigarrette smoke  I woke up with a headache and stuffed nose    I am now missing one article of clothing  a leather purse  and another personal item   all were in my room when I first arrived    My trash was never emptied and dirty soap was left in my room   of course that was before the theft at which time I had to make sure that no one would come in my room and I had to put the  do not disturb  sign on my door    I was told by the concierge that I needed    hours notice for airport shuttle even though the brochure in the room said that you only needed two hours notice  I subseqently called the airport shuttles and got a shuttle   no problem    hours in advance of my departure    I will never stay at this hotel again  
N =>  Very Pleased I agree with everyone who says that the location of the HGVC is inconvenient  However  we rented a car since parking everywhere on the strip is free and the car price was only     per day  Otherwise  our   bedroom suite was beautiful  and the pool area was nice  We were able to walk over to the Las Vegas Hilton to use their restaurant and casino facilities when we didn t feel like making the trek to the strip  Besides the location  we were very happy with our stay  We enjoyed being able to come back to our room away from the strip to relax  
N =>  Being OFF the strip is a big disadvantage   You will need a car or you ll have alot of walking to do   We thought by being  quot just off the strip quot  would be advantageous but we found it to be a total pain    We will opt to be ON the strip whenever we travel to Las Vegas again  It may look to be a short distance to the strip but it s a LONG walk in     degree weather   
N =>  Fabulous but no family friendly Our trip was in late il of       We had an incredible two bedroom that was very comfortable and very nice  The staff that we encountered were wonderful except for the concierge  The HGVC s book states that  quot Regardless of your request  you will most likely find that the Concierge Staff can offere assistance with virtually any arrangements  quot  This was one of the two very disappointing piece of our vacation  We were ignored by the concierge staff and not helped in the slightest  One example was when we requested information about a boat trip on Lake Mead we were told the the brochures were in the corner  Disappointed but not willing to give up  I specifically asked about her making reservations for us and she said there was a number in the brochure  The second of two disappointing pieces of our vacation was on Saturday  A fraternity was there for thier formals  The pool side was full of underage drinking  groping and fondling  foul language to an extreme  and broken glass  This was next to people with children   families  I was so glad my daughter was not with us  I was surprised with HGVC that they didn t attempt to tone down the fraternity college kids at all  I really enjoyed my trip  but I wouldn t call it a family place  and I would not expect to use the concierge staff  
N =>  Can t beat this place  
N =>  it was OK  
N =>  Great place to stay  
N =>  Wonderful addition to the Hilton properties  
N =>  Great overnighter Not a huge amount of things to do in the way of amenities  but a perfect place to stay overnight on business  Great accessibility  close to some good restaurants and bars  but also far enough away to be quiet and peaceful  Book a room facing east and watch the sun rise across the mountain range   
N =>   Perfect for Business Meetings We just used this hotel for one of our regional company meetings  The entire experience was wonderful  from the first phone call the check out  we loved it  We use Holiday Inn s across the country for these but this has been the best hands down  The staff went out of their way to help us  We had an account manager change in the middle of the process but the new rep contacted us immediately with all her contact info  When we went to view the meeting room the night before it was set up wrong but within   hour it was corrected with out complaint or having to hassle anyone  We were very pleased with this hotel and I would stay there for personal as well  The rooms were clean and comfortable   I m a germaphobe so for me to say that means A LOT   I was entirely comfortable in this hotel  THANK YOU TO THE STAFF   
N =>  Beste Wahl f r ein Off Strip Hotel in Las Vegas  
N =>  Good hotel great staff clean modern and comfortable We arrived at the Holiday Inn Express  Nellis  after a long journey from Seattle  having been turned away in a not very gracious manner from the La Quinta Inn opposite  who did not honour our internet reservation  Despite feeling tired and annoyed  we immediately cheered up on seeing and entering the Holiday Inn Express  It looked nice from the outside   brand new  in fact   and from the inside  where we were welcomed and given a very nice room with two large and comfortable queen beds  tv  microwave  fridge  coffee maker and free internet access  There was coffee and tea available    hours a day adjacent to Reception  together with a soft drinks machine  A comprehensive buffet breakfast was provided  no extra cost  and in addition to a smallish outside pool  there was a small inside pool and gym The bedroom was a generous size and the bathroom was good and everywhere was clean and looked new The staff were just wonderful  We had a problem with our rental car   having loaded our suitcases in the morning with the engine running in order to cool the car with the air conditioning     the weather temperature was over     degrees     the car locked itself with the key inside  We tried repeatedly to telephone Budget car rental emergency assistance  but frustratingly only reached voicemail services  The smiling and truly helpful lady on Reception  together with her housekeeper  came to our rescue  calmed us down and solved our problems     and even refused to take a generous tip for their outstanding assistance in enabling us to be on our way We would definitely recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay in the Nellis area  Not a very nice part of Las Vegas  but good for us for one night as we were driving from Las Vegas to Zion National Park and wanted to be near the correct route in the morning  There was also a large Walmart opposite which was useful to buy a car fridge and supplies for the journey  I would also mention that there appears to be nowhere decent to eat in this area   all we could find was MacDonalds and Taco Bell  
N =>  Undiscovered Gem What an undiscovered oasis this place is  Stayed three days and was never disappointed once in all that time  Luxuriously appointed rooms that were impeccably maintained as was the entire facility  Staff couldnt do enough for me from check in to check out  Quiet  well kept facility in all areas  Breakfast each morning was ample and dining area always clean and staffed  Less than ten miles to Strip and all it entails  but was nice to retreat at the end of each day to this quieter  slower pace a short distance away  Will definitely stay here on future visits and recommend this to all Vegas visitors  
N => This hotel deserves praise I was unaware that my watch was on      pm EST and checked in prematurely  It was therefore only      p m  I think it was the manager who was behind the front desk who took me in without complaint or a whimper  There is nothing fancy about this B amp B but it is clean and comfortable  I did not have much interaction with the staff but I did not find any rudeness in them  The unlimited free breakfast was excellent  Much better when I last stayed at a La Quinta in L A  I will definitely come back if I get a nice deal again  
N =>   Nice hotel not too close to the Strip Room was clean and very quiet  even know it was close to a Main road  Upper rooms would get a nice view of the neon lights of the Vegas casinos  Two big queen beds  very soft and comfortable  When we couldn t get the tv going  maintence man came promptly and was very pleasant  Breakfast had a big variety of hot and cold items   eggs  sausage patties  biscuits  amp  sausage gravy  toast  bagels  cereal  muffins  amp  pastries  coffee juice  Staff were polite and seemed helpful  We were very happy with our stay there  especially after a long sleepless flight  it was lovely to relax in such a comfortable room  My only little complaint was there was no complimentary bottle of shampoo conditioner  only body wash  amp  body lotion  No restaurants within walking distance  
N =>   Just Average We were in Las Vegas for only one night before flying home after a two week vacation in Utah  and chose this hotel over one of the large hotels so we could be close to our vehicle in the parking lot for  quot repacking purposes quot  because we had a lot of luggage  Their complimentary shuttle goes to Mandalay Bay  south on the strip  and the MGM Grand  middle of the strip   so when we found ourselves at the Bellagio  north on the strip  at the end of the evening  we opted to take a taxi back to the hotel  It cost about     but was worth it after all the walking we d done  Our bathroom could have been cleaner  and I forgot to ask for a room on the top floor so we had to listen to people stomp around above us  The breakfast buffet was typical Holiday Inn Express but the young woman tending to it was awesome  It was ten minutes until it ended and she was still bringing out fresh hot food  restocking everything  and cleaning the tables  She made my day  
N =>  Clean quiet and affordable Loved the free shuttle to the Strip  Nice  big breakfast every day  Quiet pool  Little bit of problem with reservation number we were given but this was solved the next day and no more problems  Rooms were big and clean  Would have liked to have an airport shuttle from the airport and extended hours for the airport shuttle to the airport as we ended up needing to get taxis both ways  Overall a good experience  
N =>  Another good example of this chain We chose this hotel for its close location to the airport and car rental depot  We were going to start touring the next day and just wanted a convenient hotel where we could park easily outside  At the time of booking  we could have got a Strip hotel for fewer    but who wants to park half a mile away from your room for just a one night stay The king size bed was divinely comfortable and very clean  We made full use of the free internet access  as  having flown from the UK with an   hour time difference  we were up a few hours before breakfast was served at   am The breakfast itself was good with all the usual fare of bagels  cereals  muffins etc plus some hot items If you are travelling from the UK a word of caution if you are taking SatNav with you and hiring a car  It took a long time for our new TomTom to kick in  next day in fact  and so I was glad I had printed out instructions of how to get to the hotel The next week when we returned to Las Vegas we were confronted by the traffic horrors afforded by the Strip area  but thankfully  this hotel saved us from that on our first night  We got exactly what we wanted  
N =>   Spot On Found this hotel to be just what we had hoped for  Speedy check in  pleasant staff  nice room  clean hotel  good pool and hot tub  virtually had it to ourselves   Breakfast was good  Freshly baked cookies at       hrs  Shuttle service was always on time  every    mins to Mandalay Bay and every hour to MGM  The only problem with this service is at night when the shuttle may have to make more than one journey due to numbers so expect to have to wait sometimes  If you don t have a car as we didn t then you have to go to the strip to eat as there is nothing close  There is a gas station near which sells drinks and snacks though  There was some plane noise but it never bothered us  Would recommend this hotel if you want to be away from the strip  
N =>  Rude Employees Horrible Customer Service  On the day of my arrival I called to request an early check in for my   rooms  I was told I could check in         am  I was really happy and didn t expect such an early check in  I was thinking I would be able to check in around  pm  We arrived at       am  and got all of our luggage out of the car  The woman at the desk just stared at us  didn t even greet us or wlecomed us  We told her we were checking in  she immediately responded by saying  quot Oh no  we don t have any rooms available right now  quot  I told her that I had called earlier that moring and was given an early check in  she did not believe me and asked who I spoke to  I told her I spoke to a man around     am  she looked to her sides and said   quot NO  I have no rooms available right now  give me    minutes and I ll check you in  quot  We sat in the lobby for    minutes  After waiting  we got all of our luggage out of the car and walked towards the front desk again  The man who promised me an early check was there  and we asked why did he guaranteed an early check in  His response was   quot be  I said you would get an early check in  quot  I asked again what time we could I check into my rooms  The man in the front desk replied   quot    mintues to an hour  quot  So then  I walked around for about       hours in the scorching sun  after a   hour drive  which wore out my   year old son  We went back to the hotel again and they told us the same thing   quot may be in an hour  quot  At this point my entire family decided to change our reservations to another hotel which was much more friendlier and proffesional  The sad part out of all of this is that it wasn t just us that they were rude to  We witnessed how a couple tried to check out but the man at the desk would not give them a receipt because they had checked in earlier that morning  The front desk clerk kept telling the guest that he didn t have to check out until the next morning  that there was no way he could get a receipt  But as soon as the guest that wanted to check out said I m paying cash  the clerk said Ohh  OK let me check you out    What was that about  CASH ONLY   Management needs to have a talk to the employees about their customer service skills  I mean this man was talking on his cell phone in a loud voice at the front desk  I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT PLACE  NEITHER ARE MY CUSTOMERS  FAMILY AND FRIENDS  
N =>   Good Budget Option Lets face it  there s so much to do in Las Vegas day and night that you need plenty of cash  This hotel was considerably cheaper than those on the strip  especially at the weekends  so saved us some cash to spend on going to see fabulous Cirque du Soleil  I ve stayed on the strip before and hated having to wander through casinos in those enormous hotels just to get back to your room  The Holiday Inn Express was a good place to sleep and shower at a reasonable price  nothing fancy but clean and comfortable  We had a car so the location a few blocks behind the strip was great for getting about but far enough away to be a bit quieter  I have to agree that the soundproofing could be better as we had a rather noisy neighbour who had the TV on full blast all the time  To their credit the front desk did have a word with him but I think it fell on deaf ears  Overall it s a good option for those who want to save their cash for Las Vegas  many distractions  
N =>   Great for families Our family of five stayed here for three nights  this was the only hotel that I could find that was able to accomodate us all in the one room in Las Vegas  All the other hotels on the strip wanted us to book two rooms  which would have made our trip twice as expensive The room we had was at the front of the hotel and offered a great view of the strip  it was lovely to look out at the lights at night  when we returned to the hotel  The room was very big  it had two double beds and a double bed settee  It was clean and comfortable  The kids loved the heated pool and were in it late at night and early in the morning  The breakfast was just alright The actual strip was surprisingly close by and we did not feel that disapointed on the hotels location  to far to walk though   The hotel offered a shuttle service every half hour to the Mandalay Bar MGM  We did not have to use our hire car and made full use of this service while we there  which was great  Only negative was on checking in  we had been on the road was seven hours and arrived quite tired in the evening  When I spoke to the receptionist to give the family name  he just replied  I need to see your id   I told him that my actual passport was in my suitcase and I needed to unpack it to give it to him  his abrupt reply was  well you are not checking in until I see it   His unwelcoming attitude and abruptness nearly made me walk away  so I had no choice but to uppack my case in the reception in front of other guests walking by   I must add that all the other receptionists were great and extremely helpful  
N =>   Great location but near the strip and no noise  Excellent location  off the strip but very close to Mandalay Bay  Hotel offers a shuttle that runs to Mandalay Bay and MGM every     hour  Breakfast buffet ok but reasonable as it was free  Nowhere close to buy convenience items except the gas station next to the hotel  Swimming pool clean and fairly uncrowded  Housekeeping was good Would stay again  
N =>   comfy beds great service thin walls We stayed here   nights in ch  We were originally booked for just one night to be close to the airport  we had been hiking in Utah   but our flight was cancelled due to weather  The staff immediately rebooked us for the next   nights  at a rate cheaper than we had paid for our first night  I was very relieved  Overall  the service was great  Friendly front desk people and the breakfast bar was kept well stocked for the huge crowd that was staying here over the holiday weekend  The beds are very comfortable  My only complaint  and I see that others have noted this  is that you can hear your neighbors through the walls  This is my hotel pet peeve  so I am not sure if we would stay here again  Also  the return shuttle from Mandalay Bay is not reliable  You need to call the front desk to confirm that a shuttle will come by  We waited for an hour  and finally walked home  short walk  so not a big deal   Otherwise  this a good place to stay if you want to be near the airport  off the strip  and have a comfortable bed to sleep in  
N =>   Best stay on our trip ch            After traveling around for    days  we arrived at the HI Express  We were pleasantly surprised at how easily we found the hotel and were even more pleased with our room  We were greeted quickly and checked in right away  Our room was clean and very comfortable  The beds were very comfortable and after driving from the Grand Canyon  they were very welcome  We were far enough off the road to have a quiet room but close enough that if you wanted to  walk to the Strip   several blocks away   but why  when there is a convenient shuttle to take you to the MGM or the Mandalay Bay Hotels Breakfast was a bit above average and filling  It was busy  so we kept having to ask when the muffins or juice were going to be refilled  There was a bit of a wait  since they had only   person staffing the breakfast  It was good and filling  a lot of variety My only complaint is that there was trouble with the internet  which did get corrected and the front desk offered to print out our boarding passes if we needed The AC in the room was a bit loud  but was efficient  if my son didn t keep messing with it  
N =>   Wished We Had Stayed Elsewhere Overall  dissatisfied  Although we had read other users  comments about the paper thin walls  we found this aspect particularly annoying  Never stayed in a hotel where the sound from adjoining rooms were so loud There wasn t a comfortable chair in the room to sit in Told by front desk  who were very friendly  to go to a neighboring hotel to use their computer because the printer at this hotel was broke The breakfast sausage patties were smothered in grease  the eggs were cold Only   of   elevators was working Shame on Holiday Inn  
N =>   Aussie girls say   excellent Although this hotel is off the strip it is excellent value  We stayed   days in        the money we saved we used for a  st class helicopter flight into the Grand Canyon  Staff were very helpful  rooms were great  beds very comfy  linen  amp  towels were  st class  Breakfast was included  continental  and plenty for us  Shuttle bus to the strip every half hour  Getting back not as reliable by shuttle but it s cheap  amp  easy to catch a cab back  We were very impressed  amp  would stay there again without hesitation  
N =>  Good place to stay off the strip We were catching a flight out of Las Vegas  so we stayed here one night  We re not gamblers  we went to the National Parks in Utah  It was a nice enough place to stay in Las Vegas  The bed was very comfortable  and we turned the fan on in the heating ac unit so any noise didn t bother us at all  Clean  comfortable  good accommodation  good breakfast  
N =>   So near yet so Far    Just returned from a fly drive to USA with my husband and   year old daughter  stayed in the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas for   nights  In my opinion it was absolutely perfect for our requirements  We had an executive twin Queen room which was much larger than average complete with microwave and full size fridge  The beds were so comfortable  although the air con unit was noisey  Location wise  it was just a five minute drive to the strip  where free parking is available at every hotel and also only ten minutes drive from the airport  It was great to be so near to the strip  but I was glad that we chose not to stay at the hotels there as they were loud  noisey and brash  just as you would imagen for a town called  Sin City   Breakfast was great with a good choice of cereals  yoghurt  friut  muffins  dainish pastries etc  Also it had a computer  amp  printer in reception area to enable you to look up stuff on line or check your email  Pool was great with towels available  usually had it to ourselves  All in all I would definately stay in this hotel again  especially it you are travelling with kids  
N =>   Just right  This was the perfect Vegas hotel for us  With   children  aged    and    we did not want the full on  non stop casino invasion of the main hotels on the Strip  The Holiday Inn Express was easily accessible  but yet away from the hustle and bustle  When we went into the pool we had it to ourselves  Not a slot machine in sight  The room was clean  comfortable and spacious  plenty of room for the   of us  We got the free shuttle to the Strip a couple of times but soon realised it was just as easy to drive to one of the hotel car parks on the Strip  The complimentary buffet style breakfast was great each morning with plenty of choice  We would definitely visit this hotel again  
N =>   Great Place off of the Strip We recently stayed at this Hotel two separate times in a    day span  We were taking a motorcycle trip to California and the Grand Canyon and stayed here at the beginning of the trip and for two nights when our trip was competed  We were very impressed with the cleanliness of this Hotel  It had a great pool that was opened to midnight which was great as we returned from our bike ride later in the evening and this was a great way to cool off  Our room was very nice  we had a King sized bed  a table with a chair and another chair in the corner  Bathroom was a nice size as well  Would be nice if all rooms had fridges but you could obtain one on a first come first served basis for     per day  We didn t bother as we put ice in the sink to cool our drinks  Breakfast was very good  had lots to choose from and had a very nice area to sit in  The fireplace in the middle of the room was a great touch  We left our suitcases with management while away and they stored them for us  away from where others could get into them  This was very nice of them  The shuttle was nice to have and goes to the Mandalay Bay every half hour  We felt this could be made better if you were allowed to call for a shuttle when done on the strip as sometimes we had to wait more than a half hour for our return shuttle  We would defenitely stay here again and I think that once they expand the strip that way  which they look like they are doing right now  this will be a prime place to stay  
N =>   Well managed A very warm welcome after a long trip from the UK  We were greeted with a smile and a choice of rooms  Everything was done to make us comfortable  The Air Conditioning was a little noisy but it had to work hard whilst we were there  Breakfasts were the usual motel style and of good quality  A maid was always on hand to replenish and tidy up  It was significant that the manager was frequently visible  This was unusual at other motels on this trip but she kept an eye on things and chased her front line staff when appropriate  This motel might not be on the strip but there is a free shuttle provided twice an hour and  there is also a free shuttle to the airport and or the car hire centre  to meet travellers  demands We would not hesitate to use this hotel again  
N =>   VERY Clean Hotel Not within walking distance to the Strip  but free shuttle  We had a rental car and parked for free at the hotels  Very easy in out parking at hotels  Did notice that the buses on the Strip were always crowded  even on Mon  Tue  This is a VERY clean and newer hotel  I am very particular about a hotel being clean  I even look at caulking lines around toilet to make sure they are clean  Coffee maker and tea bags in room  along with blow dryer and ironing board  Bedding was great  You have a choice of firm or soft pillows  No frig or microwave would have been nice   No ice machine on  nd floor which we were on   Did not hear any outside noise not even the planes   but the floors are very thin  People above us came in around      AM and sounded like they opening and closing their dresser drawers over and over again and just walking around for about an hour  Even the A C couldn t hum that out  Would get top floor next time  Lobby area was very clean  front office staff very friendly Brian  and helpful  Good variety for breakfast  Entrance of hotel had a great variety of coupons and magazines with coupons  Someone earlier mentioned the neighborhood was shady around hotel  I did not find that to be the case at all  Not much to really do withing walking distance from hotel  But who needs that when you have the Strip  This hotel is closest to the bottom     of the Strip  Spent   days here and only completed     hotels on the Strip  Hotels are farther apart than they seem on the maps  Was there on a Monday and Tuesday and did not notice the lines to be long at all  Was still pretty busy during the night even though it was during the week  Was worred about all I ve heard about people standing on the side of the street handing out mini flyers of     dressed women they did that but were not pushy at all   but not one tried to hand them to us since we had small kids with us  Had the buffet at Terrible s and it lived up to it s name  Yuck  
N =>   Stay Here  Excellent Hotel Yes  I felt silly saying I was going to Vegas and staying at the Holiday Inn Express  But that faded away when we checked in  The staff was friendly and the service was impeccable  The room was clean  no hints of smoke ANYWHERE in the hotel  The pool was excellent  never crowded  we usually had it to ourselves   The beds were incredibly comfortable  and the hotel was quiet so we got lots of sleep  check other hotel reviews  you won t find that elsewhere   There was construction next door  but we never heard it while inside  Breakfast  FREE  was excellent  fresh warm cinnamon rolls  variety of juices  cereals  bagels  waffles  fresh fruit  yogurt  The bathroom and the shower   excellent  We used the shuttle to the Mandalay Bay often  and again  were very impressed I wanted to rest and relax at my hotel during my stay  and the Holiday Inn Express was PERFECT for that  I didn t want a  quot party pool quot  or a smoke filled hotel room just to say I stayed at one of the famous hotels  When I return to Vegas  I ll stay here again  
N =>  welcoming and helpfull staff what a great hotel just a shame it is off strip  apart from that i couldnt fault it  it was clean the staff were very informative and the free breakfast was a good start to the day we stayed for   nights and then were booked into the luxor for the rest of our stay if we had have known before booking how nice it was we would have probably not bothered with the luxor    this is another reveiw i have to write but not good    the room was i good nice size clean smelling and the beds comfortable  we were on our  th travel expedition to america and always like to wonder about and do our own thing without being bothered and the hotel was very helpful when we needed to get to somewhere but didnt bother us if we didnt need anything  the shuttle bus was helpfull if you wanted to get to the strip without driving well done to all the staff for our pleasant stay we would certainly return and have told lots of friends about you  
N =>   Great Place to stay off the Strip We stayed there following the good reviews on Trip Advisor  the location is very good if you dont want or need to stay on the Strip and much much cheaper  The front desk was efficient and helpful  the room spacious and clean great fluffy towels   super  comfortable beds  The complimentary breakfast was more than enough and of good quality and the cinnamon rolls        well they are as good as they claim to be  A regular free shuttle to Mandalay Bay was a bonus   check it out 
N =>  Honey moon stay This was not a bad place to stay the employees were very friendly and the rooms were clean  The rooms are a basic hotel room nothing fancy  They Have a free bus to Mandalay Bay and a free brakfast which will save you some money  We did have afew problems however  First off the employees were very nice but didnt know much about getting around or about Vegas second the pool was closed for some reason for about   days out of our stay so we had to go to another hotel and use there pool which wasent heated  They were also recharging there back up battery so the lights in our hall was out the one day  I havent made up my mind on satying off the strip yet  It is less busy and there are store where you don t have to pay a arm and a leg to get a drink or snack but the extra little trip to the strip seams like a pain some time and you don t quite get the magic feeling when your not on the strip  All and all I would stay here again but think it is a better place if youve been to Vegas afew times  
N =>  So airport handyI couldn t sleep Very clean room  but no mini fridge or microwave  Pool well located for tanning all day  Pool and hot tub temperatures were very good  The bfst was excellent in variety with cinnamon buns  muffins  bagels  oj and excellent coffee etc   There was no noise from other rooms  The window air conditioning was   high speed but it didn t drown out the airplane noise which was continuous all nite  The schuttle to the Mandalay was handy but the food there was very expensive      for a boil in a bag dinner for   It was    degrees outside but they still didn t allow shorts in the lounge  snobs  
N =>   Fantastic place to stay   don t miss this bargain in Las Vegas As with other reviewers I have to say that this hotel was one of the best places we have stayed in a long while  Last time we were in Vegas in       we stayed at the Luxor which we enjoyed but for value for money the Holiday Inn Express wins hands down  The beds were so comfortable  I wanted to take ours home with us   The cleanliness of our room and the rest of the hotel was brilliant and we had a great stay here    nights in ruary        We only had one slight glitch with our room keys but it was nothing major at all  We made use of the free shuttle to Mandalay Bay quite a lot and then got the tram up to Excalibur  If you time things well  it doesn t take much out of your day and in any case  you can spend a lot of time walking through casinos to get out of the bigger hotels If we go back to Vegas we would stay here again  
N =>  Recommended Well placed about     mile off the Strip  so convenient but more quiet  There was a Police Dog Convention while we were there  so we felt it was very secure  Beds confortable  Room bathroom very clean  There is a shuttle bus to the strip if you should wish  Would be     but the breakfast was not as good as some of the places we stayed  That said  we would recommend this Hotel  Took a flight to the Grand Canyon which was fab  One tip   go for a tour which gives you extended time at the Canyon as most only give you an hour or two to soak in the enormity of the place   not nearly enough  
N =>   Clean  Near Strip  Alternative Holiday Inn Express  Russell Road at Polaris Avenue  Las Vegas  Relatively new  clean  non casino property  Rooms were very comfortable  with the  quot new quot  HI Express bedding and linens  Breakfast was more than adequate  juices  eggs  muffins cereal biscuits  amp  gravy  fruit  yogurt  etc  A hotel shuttle will transport you to from Mandalay Bay  You re within eyeshot of many of the south strip casinos  Convenient to McCarren Airport via freeway  take  quot airport tunnel quot  to I   North  then exit left at Russell Road  There are two all night convenience stores   gas stations a few steps away  as well as a Colonial Bank ATM  We discovered the studio warehouse for Magician David Coppefield across the street you ll see the many touring trailers parked  Not much else in walking distance of this hotel complex  except a  quot Gentlemen s Club  quot  The pool and jacuzzi were sparkling clean  with nice nighttime views of the Strip lights  Oh  if you really wanted to walk to Mandalay Bay  you could probably make it in appx       minutes on a pedestrian sidewalk  but you ll have to cross a freeway entrance and exit  Complimentary computer kiosk printer just off lobby  
N =>  G t Hotel good value I stayed here with my wife and   kids     amp       we had a   bed room and it was fantastic   very clean   large and very comfortable  Swimming pool was also very handy and clean  also not very busy  We got the free bus from hotel to the Mandalay which ran every    min  we stayed all day   night at the strip with loads to do and got a taxi back which costs about      We then sat at the hot tum to bathe our feet  Go stay there it really was very good  Oh  breakfast was also super  continetal style 
N =>  Hotel great Unfortunately service poor First off  our reservation information was not readily retrieved from the front desk person  When things were finally sorted out  we thought  we checked into our room  which turned out to be a smoking room  we wanted NON  that totally stunk    as did the entire floor  Because we had a show to get to quickly  we couldn t do much other than call the front desk and ask what happened to the non smoking room we reserved  Basically the question was met with a disinterested comment about the room not being available  and would we like the room to be  quot sprayed again quot   On a positive note  the beds and bedding in the rooms are very nice  and the breakfast bar and staff running it were top knotch  Back to the bad stuff     the following day I complained to a new front desk person about how bad the room smelled and interestingly she was able to move us  It was a bit of an inconvienience  but the new room was much fresher  We had a big bag of dirty laundry to do that day  so I figured I would put a load in and then watch the kids at the pool     after bringing the bag to the laundry room  I noticed that there wasnt supplies available   so went to the front desk  They apparently ran out of guest laundry supplies    I was told there was a store nearby to get what I needed if I wanted  Needless to say  I wasn t impressed  The next day  I called the front desk to see if they had obtained any laundry supplies yet    I was told  quot yes quot  and that someone would run it up to our room  Well  after a half hour of waiting  I called the front desk and got a different guy who said there were NO supplies after all  The other downside of this hotel was the location  and the limited shuttle service to the strip  only drop off and pick up is at Mandalay Bay   I guess if you don t want to spend much time on the strip  then location isn t much of a factor The bottom line for us is the poor service we received    primarily from the front desk staff  For that reason alone  we likely would not return to this hotel  
N => Great Hotel for the entire family  This may be considered a  quot budget quot  hotel but we were treated like royalty Their beds were AMAZING   Apparently it s their new line of beds  linens  soaps  shampoos   whatever it was it was GREAT  We came from a dump of a hotel the night previous and this was such a refreshing change I m not kidding  we have a nice bed at home but I would trade mine at home for the bed in this hotel  I could have spent the entire vacation there The hotel was super clean  breakfast was great  They even gave us hot out of the oven cookies that evening The pool was nice and definitely needed in the Nevada heat AND   they have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay to the tram until      pm each night I would stay there again and again   
N => Top Value  don t bother staying on the strip  Just back from two weeks in California  driving from San Fran to Las Vegas and back  Most nights we stayed in Holiday Inns or Express because we had reward points  It was interesting to see how they varied when on the face of it they are the same  This one was best of the bunch  the fresh clean smell in the corridors made a good impression before we even saw the room  Warm cinnamon rolls for breakfast was a nice touch not found elsewhere The pool was the best of all the places we stayed and the rooms were quiet  The only minor problem was aircraft noise  it s right under the glide path  We were surprised that the windows were not double glazed  the London Heathrow equivalent felt like they were landng on the roof but there was no sound of them inside  The airport seems to close around midnight and open at     ish so it didn t disrupt our sleep Beware of the free shuttle to the strip  We thought we d take a break from the driving but jt arrived    minutes late and already full  The driver claimed there would be another along in    minutes so we sat down outside  only to find a few minutes later a queue outside of at least a shuttle full  It still hadn t arrived to pick them up when we left in the car    minutes later Parking is free in all the big hotels  so once you ve worked out how to get outside onto the strip you ve got it made  It s about    minutes drive to the Paris which was the easiest to park and exit  
N =>  Pleased again   My second stay at HI Express was virtually the same PROS     Terrific Value       on weekends   Great Shower  rainfall showerhead  curved curtain for more space  great water pressure    Good FREE Breakfast  Coffee complimentary anytime  Free internet in Lobby and WIFI in room       Secs Max from Entrance to RoomCON    Shuttle continues to be overcrowded  weekends   Plan on a backup taxi ride of about    to South side of strip  Don  t count on shuttle to make dinner or show reservations  plan ahead and reserve a limo or call a taxi  
N => Great Find Was sceptial about booking this after being on Strip for   nights but needed a bed for the night This hotel was fantastic  we got upgraded to a suite  Make sure you ask for suite     if paying as this is the only suite with a view of the strip Room spacious and lovely  swimming pool open even though it was ember and also laundry facilities on the  nd floor  There was also tea coffee maker in the room Service was very efficient and polite  nothing was too much trouble There was a curtesy bus that dropped off picked up at the Bellagio every     hour from  am to   pm which we used as was better than staying on the strip as it was dead central Would stay here again  without doubt  
N => Loved it   My husband  my two sons and myself stayed here for two nights in ember      and was very pleased  We didn t go to Las Vegas to gamble  we just wanted to see the Hoover Dam  The staff was wonderful  the rooms were so nice and clean  We got a good nights sleep because the beds were sooo comfortable  and the rooms were quiet  The continental breakfast was very good  They have a computer in the lobby you can use to check emails also  and have free USA Today newspapers  If we ever go to Las Vegas again  we would definitely stay here  
N => An Excellent launch pad to the Strip  We stayed here t  of      and thought the hotel was great for the price  The hotel was clean and the room was excellent  We were unfortunately put next to room service s storage room  but never noticed any noise  IMPORTANT NOTES  they have a free shuttle every    minutes to the Strip  but get there early  The shuttle is a joint operation between   hotels and at peak times  seating can be limited  BREAKFAST  it was ok  but I really went Vegas to eat at nice restaurants  but it was nice to get a cup of coffee and a bagel before we left each morning  The also have free internet at the hotel  which was very nice  I would recommend this hotel over the Strip Casinos any day  
N =>  Great Breakfast   Very Clean      Wonderful to wake up to an early Breakfast with EVERYTHING you can think of    including Cranberry Juice  mixes well with Vodka  says my husband    WOW  As a smoker though   Would have been nice to have chairs in the front  while we waited for our shuttle  arrives every    min  I love the bedding  foam matteress  had a sound sleep They even had hydraulic doors to every room  so that no door slams down the hallways  Let s not forget Holiday Inn s showers that are wide spread and the pressure was great Laundry room was availiable to us as well  felt like home   HA  quot What was brought to Vegas     Stayed in Vegas quot                    Bob and i Ann Cartersville  Georgia   Originally from Illinois  
N => Very Good Stay  
N => Very pleasant stay and our room smelled clean       
N => Holiday Inn   near the strip  
N =>  Holiday Inn Express  
N =>  An Acceptable Hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice  the other time was       Not all rooms have refrigerators  The neighborhood looks ok to me  but itis definitely a ways from the Strip and airport  probably    min  from the latter  as I recall  My room was relatively clean both times  and the staff were helpful All I was using the hotel for was an overnight stay  
N =>   not bad Hotel was ok  nothing fancy  Two cars in the parking lot did get broken into while I was there  There are a lot of places to eat around and the hotel service was nice  Make sure to stay in a room on the third floor  as those have vaulted ceilings  There is no elevator though  so pack a light bag  
N =>   i was   days ago         its fine     no its not the four star luxury of the major hotel casinos in vegas    but i didnt pay three hundred dollars for a room i barely used anyways like i did the night before   i saw not a single bug    and had the back window open all night and no garbage truck pulled up   this was on a monday night    its an older motel but the room was clean    the property kept up   the only thing i could see is in the hot summer the a  c unit may not be good enough   
N =>  No Sleep Here      I picked this place after    hrs of driving time to Vegas  I was exhausted and you d think I d sleep like a log  NOT     During the night   different dumpster trucks backed up to the dumpsters located behind the hotel  If you don t mind the  quot  beep  beep  beep quot  of trucks backing up or the noise their hydraulics make lifting the bin   the diesel engine also revs during this part   or the noise they make when they bang the dumpster   times to make sure its empty then this may not bother you    however it drove me insane  Just as I would start to drift off   yet another truck came by to empty the next bin The guy at the front desk did not seem surprised regards my complaint and was short about the fact that he had no control of the situation AVOID THIS PLACE       
N =>   Will never stay there again Required to make copy of Drivers License and credit card when I made reservation Few weeks later discovered that some was trying to use my i d  with the copies made at the hotel  Fortunately the person was arrested before any charges were made on my card  When I contacted the management and told them what happened  there was no apology  Did not even offer to look into the matter  
N => Great place to stay in Las Vegas We stayed at Homestead Suites in early e  I picked this property based on the reviews that I read on TripAdvisor  This hotel is great  First  the staff was very gracious  I had a few simple requests  We were traveling with a small dog and we also needed a roll away bed  The front desk handled my requests perfectly  Our room was on the first floor  near the door  It was easy to take the dog out and we were close to our car  It was great to have a fully stocked kitchen  We were able to eat leftovers and have cold drinks in the fridge  The hotel was very well maintained  inside and out  It is a few blocks from the strip  close to stores  stations  etc  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveiing to Las Vegas  We ll definitely be back    
N => Dishonest Stressful Had a nephew in a coma at Sunrise hospital  Needed a place for family to sleep in shifts  Everytime we talked to them the prices changed to a higher price  Finally agreed on a price and later found out they charged us     more than agreed upon  He agreed that he quoted us that price but couldn t do anything about it  He adjusted a litlle but not what we were promised  As we walked each room it took us   rooms to find one that could even be okay to stay in  The first one he showed us had poop in the toliet  The others were stinky and bedding not washed  It got to the point that it was ridiculous and moved to a different hotel  They were very dishonest and we felt like they were taking advantage of our situation needing to be close to the hospital  Very stressful 
N =>  Fantastic stay The whole staff went out of their way to make my stay next to perfect  
N =>   Very Poor Guest Service Hotel does not seem to know exactly what guest service means  The hotel manager Nur A is very arrogant and front desk clerk Rosa is not only rude but does not know what she is doing  It took us more than    minutes to check in and another    minutes to check out  Having a front desk who has been there for   weeks is not an excuse for a very poor guest service  Our complaints fell only into her deaf ears  When we checked in the manager was present at the front desk and seems to impress that he is busy doing something but actually he is not doing anything and was just looking at the poor front desk clerk do her job and not giving her any assistance even though other guests were waiting to check in  
N =>   Excellent Experience  I had originally checked on the reviews and thought  quot Oh No  quot  However  I had made my reservations and needed a place to stay for my two week training  What I experienced was a very polite  helpful staff  a very clean and efficient room  and lots of peace and quiet  Everything about my stay was excellent  The staff was always more than accomadating and I found the area to be very safe  I have stayed in Vegas  quot Off Strip quot  before and found it to be scary but this was great  I had great comfort in knowing that my vehicle was safe  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend  
N => Avoid the Homestead Please avoid this hotel  it was a disaster  Our business group was here for a convention and the room was booked for us on the Las Vegas end  We couldn t believe how disgusting the rooms were  and everything else in town was booked  There was no internet service  there was no maid service for an entire week  on a business trip  We had to buy towles at the mall it was THAT bad  The rooms were dirty  they smelled  and the air conditioning was broken for six days in Las Vegas Everyone complained  the hotel was so subpar we couldn t even laugh about it  Our company terminated business with the travel agent who booked us there  
N =>  Hated the Homestead The absolute worst hotel I have ever been asked to stay in  I was here for business not pleasure and asked the business I was meeting with what was a quiet hotel nearby  This place was a waste of money  and a depressing place to return at the end of the day  
N =>  Very close to the airport  This hotel from what I understand is roughly one year old  the hotel seems very new  The hotel and the area are fairly quiet for the exception of the airport noise  Its located at the exit of the terminal of the aiport so a I imagine wouldnt cost much to get there  I d like to stress that this hotel is NOT walking distance to anything other than the rental car center which would be about a   to    minute walk  They do have shuttle service  however it only takes you to mandalay bay and picks up there  Overall Id come back if I wanted value but not convience  not there fault  
N =>   Nice Place but unhappy with service Our family of   stayed for one night at the end of a trip outside the US  The property is very nice but we were not happy with the service  Half way through the designated breakfast time  much of the food ran out    excuse was that they didn t expect to be so busy  That excuse is not acceptable  Next issue is that before going to breakfast we took our bags to the car  leaving only a couple of items in the room  including some medication that is taken after eating  The maid was not on the floor when we left the room  While we were out the room was cleaned   even though we had not checked out  The maid put the few items that we left on the bathroom vanity into a bag and had it on her cart  however the medication was gone  It had been thrown away  This action was also not acceptable  This is a nice place but does not appear to have good management  For that reason we do not recommend this property 
N =>   Nice inside but too far from the conventions and taxi costs too much  We had the two room suite       small kitchenette  fair living area  rooms are nice with standard tub with shower  good ac heat  rooms with ceiling fans  helps   four of us Beds are very soft and pillows not for me   bring your own    others in my group had no problem Their continental breakfast   hummmm   well lets say stick to the coffee unless you have a strong stomach  Not much in the way of a store at the front desk Taxi rides to Sands convention center averaged         with tip  each way  car rental for four days cost us          well worth it  Hertz   The hotel is not well known so make sure you have the address when you leave to give to the next taxi driver to get back  
N =>   Comfortable and Quiet    Yet Close to the Action This hotel is a wonderful place to stay if you want to get a good night s sleep in Vegas   but still be close to all the hubbub during the day  Rooms are reasonably priced  new    clean and spacious The staff is very helpful and friendly  We were thrilled to find out that they have a shuttle that takes you to the airport or to the Mandalay Bay Hotel  You can get everywhere from there by walking  taking the tram or Monorail system  Taxis are available  but you have to wait forever and they are not cheap We loved the free breakfast    lots of variety We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  
N =>  Brand New Homewood Our second stay in a Homewood didn t compare to our first stay  but it still was nice  The  quot dinner quot  here was anemic and disappointing  mini burritos and chips with salsa  really more of an afternoon snack  certainly not like the other Homewood I stayed at which had a real dinner  Breakfast was ok  certainly not up to the standard at the other Homewood either   tasteless scrambled eggs  dry sausage and cold amenities pastries This place was brand new  So new I wondered if anyone had stayed in our suite at all  Some lamps weren t plugged in and our hot water didn t work at first  the maintenance guy had to come and  quot fix it quot  somehow  We stayed in a   bedroom   bath suite  with sofabed and   TVs   for only      which was awesome   full kitchen too  Certainly bigger than anything else you could ever have in Vegas for that price  The location itself is hard to find and away from everything else  really quite isolated   although it is obviously in a flight path of the airport  Still  I found it very quiet  just what we needed on the last night of our trip  My main complaint is that they need to work on their food and presentation  I d rather have less choices which were high quality  than more stuff that was subpar  Certainly not the quality I ve come to expect from Hilton hotels  
N => Perfect Very good location to stay at south strip  One of Vegas smaller hotels  which I prefer It doesn t take long time to get access to your room  
N =>   I enjoyed my stay Well after reading most of the reviews  I was very hesitant to go  But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived  Check in did not take that long  The room was clean  beds were good  Staff were nice to deal with  I paid less than    bucks a day fri tues   Location was awesome  A few cigarette burns here and there  but room was better than I expected  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to save a few bucks  
N =>   WOULDN T STAY HERE AGAIN My husband and I decided to go to vegas and on our drive up we booked the room here at Hooters  We thought it was a good price  However we will never stay here again  To start off the elevators are falling apart  There were cracks in the corners from the top to the bottom  if you push the wall a little you can see through   SCARY     The hall ways to the rooms are so dirty and it smelled  There was no ice in the ice machine the whole time we were there and had to go up   floors to get ice  Our shower didn t work right  Half the water came out of the shower head and the other half came from the tub spout  The handle to turn on the water in the shower needed major maintence  Our air heater was sooo loud that we had to turn it off to sleep  The capet was so dirty and the room smelled funny  However one nite we got in really late  or you can say early  about  am  and were hungry  so we ordered room service and I would say our food came fairly quick and it was hot and tasted good  We had decided to extend our stay but did not stay here  We booked another room at another hotel and stayed   more days there  This would be a decent hotel if they would keep up with the maintence and do a little more cleaning  
N =>   Nice room good facility adequate staff  We checked in and were given keys to an occupied room at the opposite end of the facility  Had to return to the lobby with baggage and baby for another room  We were never offered help with luggage which would have been polite after making us walk so far  Wanted big bed but got   standard  it was a pleasant surprise that we could get an infant bed  We liked the room  it was very clean and tasteful  not fancy but good  Beds were adequate Big letdown was the staff  Most were polite but nowhere near the standard I find at the restaurants which we frequent  when we returned to the desk after being given the wrong room we were helped politely but never felt like we were important  The   desk people chatted with a  rd employee from retail  the desk guy was trying to get a free shirt  The girl in the poolside cofffee shop in the morning was just plain rude  
N =>   If this is a   star hotel I don t even want to know what a   star would be    If you re traveling on a budget  pick something else  I m pretty sure you ll be better off at Tropicana  Excalibur  Circus Circus  Riviera  etc    This place was awful  Their staff is not really friendly  The front desk guy was short and harsh when we were checking in  When we got to the room  the decoration was cheap and tacky  one of the lamps was damaged  the beds had a dip in the middle  like very used mattresses   the sink was clogged  and there were shampoo bottles from previous guests in the bathtub  My brother s room had a wet  used towel  Basically  the hotel has  quot Please  remodel me quot  written all over it The hostess at the Dan ino restaurant was not friendly at all  It looked like she was doing us a favor   and she wasn t very happy about it  Plus  they wanted us to wait    minutes to get a table at   in the morning even though we were only going to get food to go  The good things about the hotel were the wings and the location  And that s about it  
N =>   Not bad for a B hotel off the main drag Liked the hotel on the whole  Not as fancy as the MGM across the street  but close enough to the strip to get to things  accessible to the monorail and the prices were good  
N =>  excellent holiday this hotel was excellent   ideal location to walk anywere   rooms clean and had everything you needed casino was ideal size not too big but again had evertything you needed pool was gorgeous weather was lovely for november sat by the pool most days everyone in our group enjoyed it and they varied from age    to    men and women  room had   double beds in tv and computer games   
N =>   Excellent value for money just round the corner from The Strip Check in and out were slow and the standard of service at the desk neither as efifcient nor as friendly as we experienced in other hotels and motels while in the US  however this hotel was excellent value for money  less than     for two nights    We were supposed to have a Bungalow room but were given an Ocean View one instead   this turned out to be a blessing as it was several floors up away from traffic noise and music piped around the pool area from early morning  The room was large and well appointed  The only gripe was that the bath took ages to drain of water when having a shower  The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was good varied and fruit plate I had was huge  Prices on a par with the other places we breakfasted during our holiday  The room was quiet  however we think that occupancy levels were pretty low  The other guests of the hotel were predominantly a younger crowd than us   we re in our late   s  
N =>   Never again I will never stay here again  The worse service ever  I would rather stay at Motel   where I have recieved better service  I was given a smoking room even though I told them due to me being asmatic I needed a non smoking room  They didn t even make an effort to accomodate me  The view I saw was trash  When the maid came in to make the bed it looked like she just threw the bedspread and pillows  The Dan ino restaurant had extremely slow service even though it wasn t crowded  I was completely dissapointed  I have written a letter to the hotel manager but have yet to recieve a response  
N =>   Hooters better than I thought it would be  After reading some of the negative reviews on this hotel casino I was a little unsure  but   the price was right  amp  it was so near the  quot strip quot  First  the room was clean  fair sized  amp  comfy  I also had a great view of the strip from my window The pool was awesome because it is open       After a big day night of LV  it was nice to swim or hot tub at any hour  It is nothing fancy at all  Just a nice  amp  clean pool    of them   amp    hot tubs On site restaurants were fine  nothing special  The casino was nice because it was small  amp  clean It is right across from MGM so you can just walk across the street to be in a huge casino  night life  studio     fun night club     amp  the tram  the tram will take you up the  quot strip quot Tropicana is right next door  amp  Excalibur across from that  So it is near many fun things to do if you don t have a car  I stayed when the prices were dirt cheap  It was only     a night  but I see their prices have gone WAY up  too bad  it is not fancy  Not all that sexy either The people who work there are real nice  amp  professional as well  the security guards were NOT awesome  They mostly talked to each other  amp  never really seemed to care what was happening around them  I had to ask them a question  amp  they both seemed annoyed I interrupted them  Oh well    
N =>   Great Hotel for the price and location not to great if you have minors  We stayed at hooters las vegas from     thru the   th  We went to Vegas for a wedding and decided on this hotel as it was fairly cheaper and close to the strip  its a pretty small hotel not as big as i thought it would be the staff was very nice to you IF you where gambling if you where just walking through the casino they seemed to be very rude and very rude to my son  I have a    year old  we where walking to the garage and we where waiting for the rest of our party to catch up  so we stood right in front of the elevators to wait for them  this very rude person comes up  who works for hooters  and rudley asks him ARE YOU OVER       i looked at her and said no he is not and your point  she tells me well this is a gaming area so he is not allowed here  i said ok well we are staying here and going to our car we are by the elevators  which mind you there are no games by  and she was like well he needs to wait in the garage  i looked at her and was like umm yeah i dont think so but thanks for your suggestion LOL  at that point the rest of our party arrived and we left  The gift shop sucks it only has a few items  most of the areas are empty or just have   or   shirts  OMG and the restaurant ewwww   i had never eaten at hooters before so we decided to have dinner there our first night to try out the wings  Once again because we had a minor we had to wait longer as they only have one area for you to sit with minors   all this really means is that the girls dont bend down and have there hooters all over the place LOL   Once the wait was over we where seated  right by the kitchen area where all the traffic is because everyone is going back and forth to get the food  The girls   i was a little surprised i thought they would all be very pretty with nice bodies and that was not the case  I was sooo dissapointed with the wings they where just oozzing grease and had no flavor whatsoever and these where suppose to be the hot wings  All in all i would never go back to that restaurant   
N =>  Cheap price friendly staff but would prefer to stay elsewhere for a few bucks more scored the room for     which included a breakfast  all staff we came across was friendly  room was a decent size but really needs to be updated  i would typically say it was amazing bang for my buck but in Vegas perspectives  i cant say such a thing  for about the same price or maybe      i couldve stayed at many other options including Excalibur  which i have stayed at before and was much nicer and with a great location  also Sams Town was cheap and better but I avoided due to nonconvenient location for my plans on my trip  overall  not terrible  but i personally would try something else on my next round  
N =>  Not as nice as I thought  but definitely worth      Hotel was okay  I expected it to be a little nicer since it said that it opened in       but I think they just redid an older hotel  Dealers were really nice and taught me how to play craps  Had a lot of fun at that table  The dealers were not the standard  quot Hooters quot  type workers though  so that was different than I expected  I only paid     per night so it was a great deal in that regard and I would stay there again because it was so inexpensive  If you don t mind staying a tiny bit off the strip it ll work    
N =>  great time had a great time  check in was very good staff was great very informative  room was cozy for the price best deal  went to see tod paul very good  casino was small but nice  pool was nice but very cold  Stayed there twice and loved it will stay there again  Food was great at marino  the steak with garlic sauce was excellent  Plus hooters food was great to  Check out was very easy  Needed a later check out and got it with no problem thanks  
N =>   Hooters is just for Wings   LOOOVE hooters wings but not their hotel   waaat kind of place is this anyways   we weren t in the room more than to change and sleep but wow was it run down  Moldy showers  Dirty Carpet  DUMB front desk staff  and to top it off as we were packing to leave I discovered ANTS on the bed that had found their way to my suitcase  One reason would be because Room Service didn t clean up food from the hallway     just GROSS  
N =>  Wouldn t stay again It was the worse nite of our stay in Vegas  The carpet was filthy the valet was terible he suggested i was on something  LOL the front desk was so slow my grandma is faster then they are  the key cards didn t work my wife had to wait a     an hour for me to get back to here  The only thing i like there was the waitres in the ino room and the wings  Thanks for a bad evening Hooters Jim 
N =>  Stay Away from this Hotel Worst Experience We have Ever had in Vegas  We visited second time Vegas and stayed in Hooters for   nights  We were so upset by everything with this hotel    We booked this hotel through hotel com  When we checked in they gave us different room then we have selected and we have paid for in advance  There was only   person at the front desk and long queue We waited for almost an hour     There was only   persons at Valet parking and long queue of cars too     Next morning we faced a terrible problem of water blockage in bath tub  We called     times to front desk  Maintenance  Operator etc  Staff was rude and not helping  Waited for     hr for engineer  We missed our show     The same day we came back at the end of the day and found our keys are not working  We were on   th floor and did back and forth to front desk     times to get keys fixed  Nobody cared wasted   hour again in hall     again there was a problem in toilet  Water was running on and couldn t use it for long time  Same as previous day with maintenance service    We expected some kind of apology compensation at the time of check out for all the troubles we have faced but completely ignored Stay away from this place  you would find better place on the strip or close to  
N =>  Never stay there again      Room had major issues  The bath tub didnt drain so the water back up to our ankles and the bathroon sink had plumbing problems  I told the front desk about the room as soon as it started that night  The next morning  the remodeling started next door   When I asked to change rooms  the supervisor  she  told me it would be a hour before we could change  After a hour went by  I asked the front desk they kept saying not sure when a room would be available  The one had a hole punched in it  After several hours went by  I asked the front desk again he said still not ready yet   I told him that the supervisor said it would only be an hour  yea right  He went back and spoke to the same supervisor WOW he came up with a room  finally after waiting all day  I know we get what we pay for  But OMG this was very bad  So was your public relations  Your website is very false leading  At least one thing room service was friendly  
N =>  Did I really pay for this   Just returned from a long weekend in Vegas and have to share with you  This place is a dump  From the snotty front desk  to the bad food  filthy dirty carpet in the halls  nasty windows  For the     price tag was expecting dated maybe but not just nasty gross We went to the Dan ino for Sunday brunch   OMG  Seat yourself fine  all tables dirty  busser took our drink order after    minutes  another    then someone else brought them  We got our silverware from another table  along with condiments  waitress was polite but a horrible waitress  After the entire   hour  I asked to pay for one buffet as i took one plate and left most of it  They did comp the meal but I would never go back again Room was ok size but nasty carpet  filthy windows  and a c unit that ran all of the time  and not quietly  Outside was     so turning it off was not an option  It was basically a spring break  sleep  puke and party situation  One passed out in the hall by the phones while I was walking to the restroom  another left a bucket of vomit by the soda ice machine on our floor  it stayed all night and into the next morning  Save yourself and pay another    bucks and stay somewhere else  The only positive was the polite security guard that showed us to our room and came back again to open the doors when the keys did not work  
N =>  Not Bad   Check in was good  Hotel  pool and casino is small Did not win at the casino did see someone win         on the free        games Was upgraded to the tower rooms no charge The rooms were ok  mostly just slept there The cleaning service was good The air condition worked good in the room Stayed   nights          not bad  You have to walk to the MGM to get to the strip  or else a long walk up the street  only a       taxi fare from the airport Overall you have to get a good deal to stay here  It is like a hotel good to slept  shower and go do your thing Did not eat there not sure how the places are Not a bad place  they do try    
N =>   Disgrace to the LAS VEGAS scene This hotel is not fit to be in or anywhere near the strip let alone in front of the MGM This hotel was of low quality  very old  dirty  grotty and the rooms corridors are rubbish  This hotel is no comparison to the neighbouring  Real Casinos  The pictures on their website are very misleading Save yourself the disappointment  paythe extra and go to a decent casino hotel like MGM  Bellagio  Wynn  etc  You can probably even get a room in Luxor for the price of Hooters  Luxor is not as booming as the main casinos  but atleast its decent  fairly new  neat and looks wicked on the outside   like a pyramid They even charged us a resort fee after we had left  on our credit card  When we emailed them  they said its in the small print onthe booking agreement  I have checked the booking agreement and it says nothing aout such nonsense Also  on check out  they told us no more charges  yet they di the dirty on our credit card  
N =>   Dingy rooms but okay overall I probably wouldn t have stayed here  but I got a great deal on a room  so I gave it a shot Pros Small casino   easy to get to from your room  Didn t do much gambling  but made out pretty good on what I did  and the cocktail waitresses were quick to bring comped drinks  even when I was just playing penny slots Very friendly staff   upgraded my room for free  bartenders were cool and made good drinks  Nice eye candy from most of the Hooters girls ent location   technically off the strip  but you can be on Las Vegas Blvd  within minutes  If you cross Tropicana to the MGM s back entrance  it is a quick walk to get to the monorail  If you re planning to go downtown  you can head a block south and get the route      which is cheaper  less crowded  and much faster than the Deuce  Room service food was good overall   got to my room in about    minutes and the quality of the food actually wasn t that bad Good deals on food if you re not too picky   the Dan ino s tries to be classy but basically it s a glorified Hooters  The    cent wings after midnight did hit the spot after a long day of drinking though Beds were clean and comfortable  It was actually pretty quiet in the hallways and I didn t hear any noise from my neighbors   overall I got some good sleep in the room Cons Elevators look and sound like they re about to collapse  They re almost as bad as the notorious ones at the Imperial Palace Hallways and rooms are in serious need of rehab  New paint job and carpets are in order   lots of stains  cigarette burns  etc  A room service tray I placed outside of my room to be picked up was left there for over    hours Ice and soda machines on the floor did not work A C unit was extremely loud TV seemed like it was about to go on the fritz   sound kept going in and out  Ordered a movie one night and it kept going back to the PPV menu Overall  if you re a guy looking for a cheap room to basically sleep and shower in  and aren t picky about your accomodations  this might fit the bill  Overall  if you re looking for cheap digs  I would prefer getting something closer to midstrip like Imperial Palace or Bill s  but if you get a good deal  Hooters may be worth your while FYI   do not take a shuttle from the airport to get here  I figured that since Hooters was so close to the airport  it would be a quick trip   no such luck  Took well over a hour  and the shuttle I arranged to pick me up was over a half hour late before I decided to just grab a taxi  The extra       you d spend on a taxi versus a shuttle is well worth it  
N =>   Love the place   Highly reccomended I highly reccomend this hotel  clean and lively and cheap  This was my  rd time here and would not stay anywhere else  
N =>   DO NOT Stay At Hooters Hotel  First off let me start by saying  I am absolutely not a picky person   as long as I am in a clean environment  I m good  I wanted to stay at a cheap Hotel in Vegas because I wanted to spend my money elsewhere  gambling  dining  shopping etc   well not only was Hooters cheap it was extremely dirty and gross  The location was not that bad  unless you want to be in the middle of the strip   The check in check out people were extremely rude  they were not helpful with our questions and gave us total attitude  The casino was amazingly small and was kind of a joke  While walking down the hall to get to our room we noticed lovely stains all over the floor  which were gross  When we got into the hotel room we noticed stains everywhere  The A C was incredibly loud and it sounded like there were small animals in the unit trying to escape  The bathroom was horrible   There was one towel  amp  one wash cloth  The bed had no sheet on it and we had to call room service up to see if they could put a sheet on our bed  which took   hours  Our room keys constantly would not work and we would have to make frequent trips back to the front desk to get out keys renewed  At the end of it we noticed almost      added to our hotel bill  they had  quot accidently quot  messed up our bill and put random charges onto it  which we had to fight them on taking the charges off  Seriously  if I could do my Vegas trip over again I would spend a little more money and stay at a nicer  amp  cleaner hotel  Hope this helps  
N =>   Grotty But liveable We staid in this hotel in march      We wished we had stayed in circus circus  the place was full of frat style men  trying to relive there youth  giving unwelcomed attention to any female that walked past  We were asked for a massive security deposit at check in  we had no credit or bank cards with us   so had to pay cash  the reception desk was unsympathetic and just stared at us whilst chewing gum  never have I paid deposits and I have stayed in Hiltons etc belive me this is no hilton We stayed out in the back house through the small grotty casino and through the pool area  The room was clean   and we had a TV and a small balcony  the best bit was we had rear parking and rear access to our room so not having to troll through the casino front again  its in a great location and you can walk the strip etc no problem  I am glad I stayed there for the experience but will never go there again 
N =>   Not a deal just dirty I looked at the reviews and I decided to give Hooters a chance  since I was looking for a  quot deal quot  and I knew I wouldn t be spending too much time in the room anyways  My girlfriends took me to Vegas for my bachelorette party and I didn t want them to have to spend too much money on a hotel room  Well  I kind of wish we spent a little bit more  First off  I thought the crowd in the casino would be young and fun group of twenty and thirty somethings  Insteasd  It was a bunch of old and trashy people who looked like they had been up for    hours straight  I guess it wouldn t matter if you just need a clean place to stay and you don t plan on gambling or using the pool facilities  Unfortunatly  the room was just as bad  Honestly  I am not a picky person  If the place is basically clean  I can deal with it  Well  the room just had a nasty feel  The bed sheets had stains on them  I didn t even try to firgure out what it was   half of the carpet was wet and we all had to wear shoes in fear of athletes foot  The beds were tiny and the bathroom was not cleaned very well  Oh  and the a c was so loud it kept me up at night  Again  I am not picky  and I really think this hotel is nasty  In fact  we were tempted to go find another hotel   I am all for saving a buck  but please spend a little bit more and avoid this dirty place  Trust me   
N =>   WARNING  False Advertising  We booked the  quot Standard w      of Extras quot  and recieved only one of the offers included in the list of  quot extras quot  which was the      of promotional slot play for each of us  The free buffet  rib special  complimentary drinks at Pete  amp  Shorty s and Dixie s  the complimentary tickets to The Mentalist  the     in match play  and the     in free play all were not fulfilled  When we brought this to the attention of the management there they just spouted off that they  quot reserve the right to change the promotions and other offers at any time  quot  Well the thing is we wouldn t have stayed there without the      of extras we thought we were getting and paid more for the same room because of those extras that were supposed to be included with the room  Then there was the room issues  first they didn t have the   double bed standard room we reserved but instead put us in thier cheapest  quot bungalow quot  room with one bed  First one had ants all over the place  Second one the sink and shower didn t drain and had ants but fewer than the first room  The third room they moved us to was a little better since the beds were actually made but even after turning the shower head on the water continued to come out of the spout so you ended up in over   foot of water by the end of your shower  They finally put us in the correct room the next day but we paid more than we should have for that first night and moving your luggage four times in    hours isn t the best way to start what you want to be a relaxing vacation  Don t stay here whatever you do you can stay at New York New York or Excalibur or Luxor for just a little more and not have to deal with endless problems  
N =>   Great times The room was great  the service too  All in all I had a great time   Loved to eat my breakfast by the pool    
N =>  Major disappoinment  Staying at the Hooters sounded like a lot of fun beforehand  Unfortunately the hotel was shabby  smoky  and sleazy  Staff was tired and bored  even the famous  quot Hooters Girls quot  acted like they would rather be somewhere else  Only positive thing was the location  right next to MGM Grand  
N =>  Great stay better than expected I would recommend Hooters to all that were curious about staying here  Originally booked a bungalow and was upgrade to a lower floor on the tower upon arrival  The room was clean and the bed was comfy  That was all that I needed  The food was alright for the price  The casino was small but fun  I would stay here again  
N =>   way better than expected  honestly  after reading all of the reviews i was REALLY worried about staying here  we had booked a bungalow room in early  at a really good price  on the way there  we called to see if we could get early check in  around  pm   the staff was super friendly and was able to get us checked in around   instead of the normal  pm check in time  what was even better was that instead of getting a bungalow room  we were upgraded to a tower room which was really awesome  the room was decorated really fun and the beds were very comfortable  the bathroom was so so  there were some mildew spots in the tub and the carpet looked slightly greyish  but nothing to make us cringe  i was really pleased with our stay  its a really good place to stay on a budget and if you just need a place to stay and its REALLY easy to walk to the strip from it  we felt like we were on it  i really wouldnt listen to the negative reviews about this place because i really feel like they are left by people who expect this place to be as nice as the MGM or something which obviously it isn t because its a   star hotel  the only bad complaints i have are the parking garage was a little sketchy  the waitress  at the hooters restaraunt are bad and the breakfast at dan marinos was not tbe best  
N =>   We had a hoot  Our only really problem with this hotel was finding a room   when we first checked in the first room we were allocated was very noisy  the second hada broken window and chewing gum stuck to the table  We struck it lucky  rd time and got a great room with views down the Strip   Please be aware we are not fussy people    The location of the hotel was great  and the value for money was good  We went as a group    Guys    Girls  and we all had a positive experience at Hooters We ate at Dan inos and the food was good  esp breakfast  
N =>  Would not stay there again Second time I ve tried the hotel  First time had to be moved from cabana area to the Towers because the first room was overrun by ants  This time the room in the tower was only superficially cleaned  The carpets are filthy  cellophane wrapper on the floor  bathroom was just not clean  The hotel needs a thorough top to bottom cleaning and new carpets  Hotel charges and extra    day on top of quoted rate  deceptive advertising on internet  Also charges almost    day for   hrs of internet connection  ripoff  Too bad as this is one of the friendlier hotels in Vegas  
N =>   Vegas Vacation      We stayed in Hooters Hotel Casino we reserved a Bungalow Room we checked in got our room and went out to eat  We were going to walk to the strip since Hooters is right off  As we were walking the wind was so bad we only made it to the Tropicana next to Hooters we looked around while we were there and since I had just drove close to    hours so I was tired and we decided to get some of the Hooters Famous Wings  big disappointment  Hooters will not sever you if you walk up and order at the bar you need to buy a drink and put a nipple on it because the wings take a long to fly to you  So after       minutes waiting we finally got them and since there was no sitting spaces available and I had an    Pack of Ice Cold Corona s in the room we went back and ate there  Now maybe what I think they forgot to drain the wings from all the grease  there was about a cup and a half in each container my wife passed on eating them and settled for the cold cuts and french bread we brought with us  I turned in about   pm I know it s early but I was up at  am that morning and drove all the way here so I was tired  Then about     am I woke up needed to take a wizard as I walked in to the bathroom I turned on the light and there they were COCKROACHES scattering I did my business and woke the wife and call the front desk  the said they would look in to it  but what was there to look at I wanted them dead or a new room out of the bungalow area too close to the pool and that attracts roaches  I could not wait or sleep so I went to the front desk  Now surprisingly the guy there was looking for another room and he said he tried calling the room with no answer but who knows for sure if he did  He had another bungalow room which I turned down so he put us up on the   th floor in the tower  a lot better away from the pool and roaches I even took one of the bell hops since he was there not doing any thing and he was cool we drank a couple of beers as we moved  he had to be discrete about it but in the next few days he hooked us up with tickets and booze as long as he could have a few drinks in our room I was cool with that he even brought a pizza and a big calzone on night about midnight some one ordered it and got in to a fight and checked out  So this what to seem like a bad start to our stay turned out all right I can t tell you the guys name don t want him to get in to trouble if the wrong person reads this All well that ends well  
N =>   Poor Management We had one night in Vegas and when we got to Hooters to check in  we found a line to the back of the Casino  We were told that people in front of the line had been waiting for   hours  This was dinner time and we were very tired and we now had to spend our night waiting in line  Not only that  but they did not do anything to make the wait more comfortable  When I asked the security personnel why the line was so long  I was given a death stare and told that the computers were down as though I was personally responsible for this  When we finally got to our room  the bathroom was disgusting  There was shampoo dripped on the shower curtain along with mildew  It had obviously not been cleaned in quite a while  The caulk was all mildewed and falling out  The floor was dirty  The floors were dirty throughout the hotel  actually  We were given a free mediocre breakfast buffet for our trouble  
N =>   The Smell of the Pool Rude Staff Computers Down and the LINE  We had found a     web only  non refundable deal  We thought to ourselves we just needed a cheap one night stay before we had to catch a plane the next morning    boy little did we know it came with the aggravation of a football field long line and a rude staff  They told us when we saw the line to stand in   quot our computers are down  they have been for three days  now go stand in line  quot  When we paid online  directly through their website  it took our payment  no problem  But when it came to getting our room  good luck  We stood there for an hour and moved   feet  no  it s not an exxageration   Thought I would check out the pool in the meantime  When I went outside  it smelled like something had died  garbage all over the pool area  When I found a chair to sit in  I think I caught something  We ultimately did not want to spend the whole night and following morning in the line  so we left  FORGET the     web special  for about     more you could go to the LUXOR  which is about a     times better than this DIVE  
N =>   Dead bugs in room smelt like sewage and dirty pool to start  To start the room had dead bugs on the floor   not just one many  our comforters had burn holes in them  the bathroom was dirty  and when we tried to open the sliding glass door in came off of the track and almost fell over the balcony  The place smelt like sewage  The pool was dirty and had stuff floating around in it  Our room was never serviced  The front desk was rude and charged us a  quot resort fee quot  on the day we left   this place was the opposite of a resort  The Dan ino Restaurant was okay minus the slow service  The bell boys were the ONLY good thing about this place  They were helpful in getting us rides and holding our luggage when needed  You couldn t pay me to go back  
N =>   So so room rude personnel Booked the Hotel online and we selected the Tower rooms  room was spacious and acceptable for the price  Registration personnel was rude  Unreasonable deposit requested at check in to cover eventual damages to the room and walking around and see all these drunk people we figured out why  
N =>   This hotel was great This hotel was great  I did not expect much but I was surprised  The room was a good size with comfortable beds and all the needed amenities including safe  iron  but no coffee maker  The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels and products  In general  it would compare it to any other   star hotels All employees were easy going and seemed to like working there  No matter who you talked to there was no  attitude   Unlike the larger casinos on the strip  people seemed to be having fun in the Casino  The pool bar was fun and Dan ino s had top quality food at a reasonable price  Dixie s Dam Bar was kind of weak  Although I had a VIP pass that stated free admission they still charged me at the door  The location is great  It s barely off the strip  Actually  parts of MGM Grand are further off the strip then this whole hotel  This is just a nice friendly reasonably priced place  I have stayed at the bigger fancier hotels in Vegas but I will return to this one next time  
N =>   Great stay in Vegas Had a Ocean view room on the   th floor  Overlooked the pool  WEather was decent so some hotties were out but afternoon weather was windy Rooms were quiet and very clean  No problems with extra noise or drunken partiers  Walls were thick enough to mask most noise Beds could use an upgrade  Squeeky but OK comfortable Casino was good and the casino service was adequate  Food  Hooters rest  and Dan inos  was good  I would recommend this hotel to anybody  Party people and some families who don t need the  quot resort quot  experience  
N =>   I would pay more just to stay somewhere else  Who knows when the room was vacuumed last  Dead bugs and old clothes labels littered the floor  The carpet looked like the original   from quite some time ago  The toilet bubbled up sewer gas periodically  including through the night   We had   in the room but did not have enough towels  When I went down first thing in the morning to request more towels   I was told that they would be up shortly   they never arrived  The only saving grace was that the afternoon desk supervisor  Frank  actually allowed me to cancel our second night   now I just have to try and get that money back from Travelocity  I will never stay there again  
N =>  OK for the cost We paid    usd per night  The room was spacious  The linen was a bit old and tatty  The staff at reception were not rude but not loverly either  The casino floor is small but always had some action     blackjack tables were great  It took    minutes to walk up to New York New York  If you can get a cheap room it is a decent place to put your bags  sleep and shower  
N =>  Pleasantly surprised We stayed three nights  Friday   Sunday  through a booking with Travelocity  We typically stay downtown so we are not what you would call high maintenance hotel people We had a non smoking room on the  th floor of the Oceanview Tower which had a view of the Strip  odd numbered room   I thought the room was clean and the bed was firm and comfortable  There always seemed to be plenty of hot water available and we never had to wait long for an elevator The pool area was quite nice but you start to lose the sun at around  PM  There was a security guy at the pool area  but we never had to show our room card or anything We loved the small size of the hotel casino  Being just off the Strip made it much easier to get to and from by car I will say this  the hotel room walls are wafer thin  I could hear the guy next door to us get his morning phone call from his wife clear as a bell  
N =>   nice choice MinusHotel smell a bit and look dirty  Internet not reliable and not free  window was not locking PlusIs not dirty  people are friendly and helpful  nice location  nice food  EXTREMELY CHEAP  comfortable  nice room service  clean room and shower and WC  hot water     RECOMMENDED  
N =>   Not a bad hotel for the price  My husband and I went to Las Vegas last year and wanted to stay in a cheaper priced hotel but didn t want something junky so I started looking up reviews on hotels  I read the reviews on the Hooters Hotel and Casino and they seemed pretty decent  We booked the room at only     night  I was actually surprised  It wasn t a fancy hotel or romantic which we were not expecting but for the price it was comfortable and clean  The elevators were a little scary  They sounded like they might fall apart at any given time and I really didn t care for the casino there but I m not a big gambler  Their promotional slot machine dollars they give you don t get you much  I never really saw anybody winning anything  But all in all it was a nice stay  We would stay there again  I will say it is probably for a younger croud though  
N =>   Clean Room   LOOSE Slots We booked this because the last time we were in Vegas  we kept winning on the slots in Hooters  We read the Trip Advisor reviews and booked through the Hooters Casino website and got a great deal  We were not expecting JW riott or Ritz Carlton  Our room was clean  comfortable  bed was a pillow top   quiet and close to the elevator and right next door to the ice machine  Never heard a peep except for the loud lady across the hall slamming her door a few times  Didn t notice an visible remodeling but don t have anything to compare to as this was our first stay  Everything was in good shape in our room   some warn spots on the chair but HEY IT s A HOOTERS Hotel  what do you expect  SLOTS WERE LOOSE  My sister s boyfriend won       within the first    hours we were there  ino s Restaurant has a great breakfast buffet  timing is everything   food goes quick and you have to wait for more fresh food  Take advantage of the Owl Rewards Club upon arrival  We got two great coupon books and ate breakfast half price for two days  Regular portions off the menu for breakfast included alot of food  When checked out  my husband and I both got money back from playing on the slots  The Main bar in the front of the casino was slow  Waited a long time for drinks but the cocktail girls on the casino floor were quick and nice  Front desk staff was pleasant  Ask for a free upgrade for a room with a view  Pool area nice with palm trees  Too cold to swim but there were fire pits  Casino is close to MGM and New York New York  Lots of visible security Will stay again   One strange thing did happen   when I was cashing my Owl Rewards in  the guy waiting on me passed out and fell back and hit his head on the counter behind him  The female staff member standing to his left didn t even flinch  I was  quot Hey this guy just passed out quot  she said  quot It s happened before   quot  Very non chalant  The other employee working the desk on the other side of the guy who passed out called security  It took forever for someone to come and the whole time  this guy is on the floor  glasses broken  eyes closed and not one person had bent down to help him or even check to see if he has swallowed his tongue or if his head was bleeding  Very freaky    I was scared for this guy  He finally sat up when security came and he seemed okay  The ambulance arrived as we were getting in our cab  I sure hope he s okay  Older guy    ish   
N =>   Place is trashy but hey for the price you can t expect more  This place is OK  Rooms aren t terrible but they are not great  I found them to be clean enough  but the halls had a bit of a smell  The shower didn t work very well and yes  you can hear everything in the halls and next door  But Hey  you aren t in your room that much I would only recomend this hotel for a younger  single crowd  definately don t bring your Girlfreind or Wife here  they will probably not be too comfortable in the rooms The place definately has a Party vibe  and I found the Casino to be preety low key and fun  Always easy to get your free drinks while gambling  unlike the big hotels where you are lucky to get a dring every    min if you are lucky The Pool area is OK to relax at but       a beer All in all  I would say this place is OK  but would not go back  A little more money will get you a big upgrade Derek 
N =>  Cheap place to stay My husband and I have stayed at this hotel and it was pretty nice for the price so we decided to stay again because it was so cheap  On Saturday our rate was only      Sunday was     and Monday and Tuesday the rate was only     night  Everyone is complaining about how its now perfect but I look at it that I just got to take a vacation for dirt cheap  If you want something spectacular then maybe you should stay that the Wynn  We booked a bungalow but when we were checking they had none available so they upgraded us to the tower  I didn t find anything different between the rooms except the tower has a view  I had no problem with my stay  You have to remember that you are staying at HOOTERS   I will stay here again just because I know it s cheap and I m not in my room very much so why pay alot for something your not using very much  
N =>  Inspiration to stay away from the room as mcuh as possible OK the price reflects the Hotel  It was cheap we got a great deal  but we paid for it  The room had paper thin walls  it was not very clean and it really inspired us to leave the hotel as much as possible  The location is great because you have easy access to other places in Vegas so you do not have to stick around the Hotel  It was a short walk to nicer Hotel Casinos like MGM  New York New York  Tropicana     It was also a short walk to a bus stop for the Duece I did find it interesting that the advertise    blackjack       Now  they do not claim that it is    hours in a row  So  do not make my mistake and assume that there will be a    table  Plus if there is one open   and only one  then it is too crowded to get a seat  If you do not want to relax in your room  and want to use it as a place to shower and drop off your bags  this is the place  If you enjoy a good night sleep  this is not the hotel for you  
N =>   Moderate maybe two and half stars I read all the reviews on trip adivsor and from what I had read it sounded like Hooters was the best place to stay on a budget  Right now they are offering an free upgrade from a bungalow to a standard room which was good because the outside of the bungalows looked like they were hourly rooms to rent seen on COPs  The Standard room was okay  It was large and the bed was comfortable but lights didn t work  the bathroom tile was chipped  and you had to call housekeeping to request whatever was missing from the room such as ice container and coffee maker  I was on the   th floor in the Bay View tower which over looked the airport and the Extended Stay America and Motel Six and I kid you not every day there were four cop cars over there busting people  It was good entertainment but was a little worriesome  The SASS spa was great  The people there were very friendly  The hooters girls were also really nice  Actually the all of the staff were great  The hotel its self would be good for college  single aged friends to stay at because if you don t spend a lot of time in your room you would be happy  Overall  I wouldn t stay there again but if my son wanted to go to vegas with his friends  I would put him up there  
N =>  Great Again We stayed at Hooters uary        this was our third trip to this hotel and we had a great time  We arrived before noon and got into our room right away  The room was clean and very comfortable  The bathrooms are a bit dated  but very clean  Everyone we encountered during our trip from the front desk  the Owl Club desk and all waitresses and bartenders were very friendly  the service was outstanding  The location of the hotel is convenient to the strip  We are planning to go back again next year  
N =>   Comfortable  Five of my friends and I went to Vegas this past weekend for a mini reunion  We wanted to stay somewhere on the strip  somewhere clean  they had a bad experience with Circus Circus before   and affordable  Since we wouldn t spend much time in the room  we didn t really need a fancy hotel room  The Hooters staff  boys and girls  were all very hospitable and friendly  Checking in and out was simple  and the front desk staff was very helpful when we needed some recommendations  We stayed on the  th floor of the tower  not facing the strip   and it was beautiful in the morning  looking over the pool area and we got to see the mountains  Dan ino s    hour fine dining inside the hotel was pretty good  I d recommend joining the Owl Rewards Club  free  and you ll get a coupon book  Within it  you ll find a BOGO free breakfast buffet ticket  That was the best meal of the whole trip  and it was only     The ONLY thing that was funny or weird was the smell that came up from the pool area to our balcony     cheeseburgers and fries  If that s a smell that you don t enjoy  then request a room in the other tower  haha  We didn t mind it though  It was more entertaining than anything  We ll definitely stay there next time we head out to Vegas  
N =>  Fun and great location  We drove into Vegas and did not have a reservation on ember           We knew that Hooters had a great deal on prices and we knew the location was right across the street from all types of conveniences  We checked in for   evenings and we were very surprised by the young vibe and great energy  Our room was clean and spacious  We did eat at the restaurant  Hooters  which was consistent as all Hooters Restaurants are  Our heater  it was very cold  rainy and windy that evening  was not working great and was a bit noisy but we were too tired to deal with it  The next day we called downstairs about the heater and they sent up a wonderful maintenance man  who immediately responded to the call  and he fixed the heater  Well that didn t last as the barrings had gone on the heater  so they moved or I should say they upgraded us to the SUITE    full bathrooms  master bedroom  livingroom  wetbar    plasmas  The front desk told us they wanted us to fully enjoy our stay and apologized for any inconvenience  The staff was very kind and personable  We loved that we could walk across the street to any casino  show  the metro  shops  etc  
N =>   Never thought I d stay here  After the airline changed my flight  I needed a place to stay for one more night  I booked Hooters through Hotels com because it was cheap and close to the airport  I just wanted to stay the night and get out early  I ended up with a Bungalow room out by the pool  This would have been great in the summer  but meant nothing since it was cold in Vegas at the time  I did not see an elevator  so I had to carry my bag up the one flight of stairs   ok  so a guy was nice enough to carry it for me   The room was clean and comfortable  I can t say anything bad about the place  The heat worked  so that was a plus  If you have trouble sleeping  I guess you wouldn t want to be this close to the airport  but I wasn t bothered by the noise at all  Hooters charges a       resort fee  parking  telephone  amp  pool  on top of what Hotels com charged  but I wasn t going to complain  I took the shuttle r t from the airport and was the first one off  last one on on the two trips  I probably wouldn t stay here again because I m not crazy about the location  
N =>   Dirty roomspoor service   Stayed   nights in     Front desk staff rude and disinterested on check in room was dirty with mold and rust in bath tub carpet old dirty and smelly My non smokeing room stunk of smoke and heater unit was so noisy I had to turn it off to sleep    minutes to cash a travelers check at desk with photo id When I had dinner in the Hooters restaurant in the hotel tried to charge meal to my room and photo id was demanded again even though I had a key card and was a registered guest Pool area was closed due to snow but was charged resort fee even though pool area was not usable they would not reverse this charge would not recommend or stay again  
N =>  The casino was better than I expected First of all  we did not stay here at this hotel but we did visit the casino  which was fine Everyone seems to complain about the      promotion that you have to play at a set of roped off slot machines  My hubby hated this  but I actually liked it  Of course  he was out in a short time and I was able to play and get drinks for quite a while  Also  the lady next to me won some money on this so I know that it is possible to win  Basically  if you want a very slim chance of winning with no money invested and still receive drink service  this is not a bad promo  I got pretty good drink service here  but my husband really went through the money and had a hard time finding a waitress to get him a drink once he was done with the promo  I think it was worth a try  
N =>   Cheezy as expected   but worth the     to be less thank a block from the Strip Check in staff were not friendly and neither were the lady bartenders  maybe because I m a girl   The hot tub wasn t so hot  but that allowed me to spend over   hours in it getting to know some Brittish guys  Room was about motel   quality  and the bathroom had mold in the calk around the bathtub  HOWEVER   I paid     for one night   it was well worth the     because you are less than a block from the strip  Stay here if you want to be close to the strip and can t get a room for under       
N =>  Crap time Hooters style Having been to Vegas several times  we have never been let down by our hotel standard  not the very top of the range but good  Stratosphere  amp  Sahara  So this time our travel partners booked Hooters  It is well located  amp  not far from the airport or Monorail at the MGM  so it is accessable  It is advertised as a Floridian theme  I never saw grey drab walls inside  amp  out in Florida dull  The room we had      was of a low standard  stained carpets  poor decor  looking onto the airport flight path with all that take off noise  We had an interconnecting door  so all in     could be heard  At some point early morning    am  in     either someone was having a ride to heaven or the adult movie was on loud  The walls are so thin  unbelievable Breakfast another bad experience        but watch out  juices  toast etc extra  The basic breakfast was a poor selection  but then again it was        Service was poor  being held waiting for seating when the place was nearly empty was a joke Waiting staff  bar one lady  was dreadfull  no tips there The whole place was well below par in every respect  To add insult on check out  we were OK  but our friends were handed a bill for drinks they never had  Someone had charged a large round of   Buds  amp  prawn cocktails to their room No  Obviously bar staff did not care to check validty of the order  They did not pay that  amp  await the outcome When you look at the deals now on in Vegas  in hindsight we should have just turned up  amp  got in the MGM of Venetian as my friends wife wished  plenty of room  Sadly we stuck it out from Monday to departing on Saturday morning our fault there  So any one reading this  please  please do not go to Hooters  it is certainly not a Hoot  quite dreadfull Take care all  amp  do not be Hootered     Les wilkinson  an un happy Brit Abroad  
N =>   Value For the Dollar I stayed during ober      I was looking for an inexpensive room in Las Vegas during the week  this was my choice The hotel was very clean the room was well furnished  the bathroom was also clean  Only one negative no tissues  but I managed If I am going to Las Vegas again I will look into Hooters  
N =>   More than I bargained for I booked our room late tember for our   night   day stay in Las Vegas because it was such a deal     a night  The insane price during Columbus Day weekend was a deal on top of       free slot play      match play   the tables  free drink   Dixie s  free breakfast buffet  free night show and more    But I was a little apprehensive AFTER reading all of the reviews  But I figured  if I checked in and it was lousy I knew there would be other options Figured out that after almost a   hour drive from San Diego and arriving at the hotel at  am  checking in was no problem and we were given a room on the   th floor in the Ocean Tower  To my surprise the room was big  spacious  amp  clean  There was a stain on the carpet  but I wasn t planning on sleeping on the carpet anyway  Two clean  comfy beds and a decent bathroom  Not to mention my own make up counter next to the minimal closet It WAS NOT bad at all and I was extremely impressed  It wasn t no Bellagio or Caesar s Palace    but when you re in Vegas all you need is a room to shower and nap in  Who the hell goes there for the rooms  
N =>  Cockroaches mold and dirty carpets   Oh my  I booked my room at Hooters Casino Las Vegas for my brother s   st birthday  The hotel halls were extremely dirty and stained  Once in our rooms  first thing I found on the bathroom floor was a cockroach   Later another cockroach was found roaming the bathtub   I was disgusted  Then on further inspection the shower curtain had several mold mounds gowing  I would expect this from some cheap motel but I paid         per night to stay at this infested hotel   I think they charge extra for cockroaches and mold   I travel to Vegas well over   times per year and this is the worst hotel I have yet to stay in  Needless to say  my brother s   st birthday is one to be remembered  just not the Vegas style memory I was hoping for  
N =>   Hooters Restaurant YES   Hooters Hotel NO  We stayed there the first month it was open and LOVED it  We stayed there again last Saturday  tember   th  This time we didn t  The deterioration was unbelievable  It s pretty obvious that employees really don t care about the facility  The hotel hallways and room carpets were black with dirt  You even saw dirt tracks permanently in the carpeting from luggage  I don t believe they have ever washed the carpets  The maintenance in the rooms were nil  Our bathroom had multiple mold and rust stains  missing shower curtain rings  toothpaste on the front of the sink  dirt in the crevices of the bathroom floor  The room had filthy carpeting and stuck taped paper toilet paper on the wall over the bathroom door  You couldn t miss it so I find it hard to understand how it could still be there  If you end up in room      look up  The slot machine promo is truly a joke as others have said  There are approx    machines that are roped off  You stand in line to push a button on a       machine and you only have   winning combinations  I also never saw anyone win anything  I actually won       in coins which added to my total but I was not allowed to cash out because it was not one of the   winning combinations they designated  The comedian was also worthless  Several people walked out of the program out of disguist  Old jokes   I definitely recommend he find some new material  Heard it all before  They could easily upgrade this facility to make it liveable but apparently chose not to  New carpeting  new paint  employ friendly people who take pride in doing a good job  One highlight   the band in Dixie s  the Country and Western Bar  that night  They were amazing and I don t even like CW Music  But  don t stand at the bar  You ll stick to the floor  I walked right out of my shoes the floor was so sticky  My husband and I got a chuckle out of that  Again  we have always loved Hooters Restaurants and plan our vacations around them all over the world  We have a Hooters wall in our bar at home  But  they ve really lost it at this facility  They need to make some real changes to bring it back to the standards that make it resideable  It s too bad    we loved it the first time  I would not stay there again without some serious renovation even with the great location and great price  
N =>  Not so great service  rooms or stay all around   of us booked our stay at Hooters for the weekend we saw Jimmy Buffet at the MGM across the street Checking in was a breeze and the counter help was great  We booked King size beds however all   couples got   singles  The were out of rooms with Kings                The rooms were not clean  hair clogged the sink  the hair dryer was broken and there was junk all over the floor behind or under anything the vacuum could not get to  Two of the four light bulbs over the sink were out  I called and got a replacement hair dryer right away  The Dan ino Restaurant when we arrived off the plane was empty  the bar was closed at      pm and our server let us know it was his last night because he was going to a better place as the restaurant was no longer highly rated  The pool side service was the worst  the waitress took my drink and food order at the same time  I waited    minutes then chased her down to see if I could at least get the drink  She said  quot OH I thought you wanted the drink when your food came out quot   The last night of our stay was the concert night  We ate at the Hooters Restarant and had a fabulous server named Stephanie  She made the best of a bad situation  We all ordered and began getting our food except my meal which they forgot because it was seafood  Stephanie removed the charge for my meal  The gift shop had really fun items and the staff was very kind  All said our next stay will be at the Stratosphere in ember  
N =>   Bad Promotion Some positive and some negative   We arrived early and were able to check in and the process was very quick with no one else in line  Booked directly with hotel because they were having a     dollar free casino credit   dont be lured in by this promotion    only certain slot machines included and I dont think anyone has ever won     cant cash out when you do win  BAD promo    and should not be deciding factor in booking this hotel  Hotel is very close to airport  so cab fare was only about    dollars  However  far away from Old Downtown Vegas  cab fare    dollars with tip  BED is awesome  shower had NO NO NO pressure at all   took    minutes just to take quick shower  We were on the   th floor though  Not a huge pool area  about        guests max or there would be to many people    Only had one bartender on a Saturday and with the huge group there had a hard time getting drinks  perfect just to lay out and jump in to cool off  Water had a dirty film on top  could have been from the huge group of people there   Loved the hooters wings   Always good    Breakfast buffet       kind of expensive  but convenient  not sure if they have a dinner buffet  ALWAYS a cocktail waitress to get drinks in casino area and at inside bar  that was nice  the bigger hotels you could hardly find one on your own  C lose to MGM  Tropicana  Excalibur and New York New York  Other hotels a bit of a walk  Overall  I would say that if I had not been lured in by promo I would have stayed elsewhere  Would only stay there again if I get hotel FREE or around       a night total  
N =>   beds are comfy We were in the  nd floor bungalow facing the pool  Yes  we had a real balcony  The bed was comfy  the view was great  but we didn t spend too much time in there  it WAS Vegas after all  We had a great time gambling there at Hooters as well as other places but after a long day of fun in the sun our bed was soooo comfy  sleeping wasn t an issue   The pool music does turn on at   am or so though     
N =>   worst    hours We always enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at San Remos  We have been going to and staying there for over   years  This year we planned early  payed for the room months in advance and was looking forward to another enjoyable trip to Las Vegas  WE HAD THE WORST    HRS  AT HOOTERS                  We got in late Sunday night  only to find that because we would not allow the boy on the desk to charge         to a charge account  in case we trashed the room    He agreed to bring the figure down to         CASH  We were tired from our   hour flight and just paid it knowing full well that we would get it back at the end of our trip because we had no intention of damaging anything OR spending a dime more than absolutely necessary here  The hotel as well as the room is in poor shape Our bathroom floor and caulking around the fixtures were dirty  The room was scary  from worn bedspreads and filth  too the poor workmanship of the wood that was added to the ceiling and every place else that it was put  We won t even talk about how bad the carpet needed cleaned and in someplaces needed replaced  It looked like they took the old San Remos nice clean rooms and tried to give them a cheap facelift  A GOOD CLEANING WOULD HAVE GONE A LOT FURTHER  The extremely loud music and extra gaming tables they squeezed in to the  quot casino quot  area made it hard to get around  There were a lot of  quot seedy quot  looking people lurking around  that made me feel uncomfortable  We thought we were stuck there for   Days  Thankfully  my husband  after discussing our misfortune  while setting up a players card at Sam s Town Hotel  amp  Casino  was offered the same price        per night  We jumped at the chance to put Hooters behind us and actually have a great vacation  Also  they did not require         or even         in case we damaged anything  They were more than happy to have us  We won t be patronizing Hooters again or suggesting them to anyone  Smarter PA couple 
N =>   Vegas baby   After reading a few of the reviews I decided to make my own mind up  was in vegas for memorial weekend in  to watch ufc and stag party most of whom stayed in the nearby MGM Grand The Hooters rooms are huge and have all you need  true the corridors might need a lick of paint but who comes to vegas to sit in their room  staff where very friendly  even got a replacement room swipe card when one of my buddies was out with ours and i needed to get into the room offered to bring it back but told to not worry about it  the casino staff were first class even giving a helping hand on the blackjack table sometimes     and the place overall had a less pretensious vibe than the larger casinos all about having fun  food was ok a bit greasy sometimes but just what the doctor ordered after a few nights on the sauce Excellent location opposite MGM   mins from strip  Excalibur  Tropicana  New York New York  Luxor and Mandalay Bay all nearby would choose Hooters again for the laid back party vibe and the lovely Hooters ladies  VEGAS BABY   
N =>   Don t do it Stayed in this hotel after a delayed flight  The staff are friendly  amp  helpful if you can ever find them  Restaurant dreadful  dirty  amp  nasty  Filthy plastic seats  appalling buffet  Bedrooms had revolting carpets  TV did not work  internet did not work  Graphic pornography on the TV when it did work  Horrible  horrible  horrible  amp  we weren t paying  
N =>  Yikes  I would probably have chosen the  quot terrible quot  category but the desk staff and restaurant staff were very nice  Upon check in  we were offered what s called a  quot bungalow quot  category room  After dragging our bags through the casino and pool area  we found our room to be poolside  I m without words to describe how nasty it was  The carpeting was filthy  the vanity sagging and it was dark and dingy  The smell which was fresh paint  covering smoke stained walls and topped off with cheap air freshener was sickening   I literally became ill from the stench  From what I could tell  it s a very old motel which is now Hooters  The walls were concrete and brick which allowed no cell service or internet access  The music from the pool was very loud and permeated the walls  Upon checkin  we were directed to sign up for      of slot play which was the most ridiculous thing  We stood in line and a very cranky man signed us up  We then stood in another line where    or so machines are roped off and pre set to pay out on what I d venture to say is a specific schedule  Many of the casinos offer     of slot play in the machine of your choice  If this was designed to get us into the gambling mood  it did not   we didn t spend a dime in the casino after this annoying experience  I would say  if you re a young man about to celebrate your   st Birthday  this is the place  The pool looked fun  the Hooter girls are cute and it s close to the strip for about     per night  We re not the boring or picky type   the smell was just too awful  
N =>  it was really ok   better than we thought Booked this hotel thru airline so it included flight       cab from airport   arrived early   pm fast checkin  room ok yes it was basic but beds really comfortable  plenty hot water  oh no  quot where s the coffee maker quot I said  cannot live without that   asked a maid in the hallway  lucky she understood  and within   minutes coffee maker and good coffee packets were delivered  now every day we had to call housekeeping to ask for more coffee packets but that was no problem  also enjoyed swimming in the pools which were larger than the basic hotels offers  room was quiet  on   th floor  taxi back to airport    
N =>   Unimaginative Management After travelling    hours from the Southern hemisphere we were looking forward to getting our heads down on a bed   but no   we had to wait   more hours  Why  My brother in law booked and paid for our rooms and I had an email printout of confirmation  but because it was his name on the reservation  and he hadn t mentioned our names when he booked  the form didn t ask for all names   and he wasn t arriving for a further six hours on a different flight  we were not allowed to have our room  The young duty manager seemed to take some pleasure in telling us he wouldn t let us in  quot because Las Vegas is a bad place and there is a lot of fraud here quot   He offered for us to buy another room  or go somewhere else    In the end we were forced to store our bags there and go out on the town until my brother in law arrived  Surely there could have been some other compromise arrived at  Apart from that the rooms were fair for the price paid  After all  its the location  over the road from the MGM and monorail  and just a block to the Strip  that makes this hotel good value for the money But would I go there again  NO Moral of this story   make sure you put ALL names on any reservation you make  
N =>  A Horrible Scam   Stay Far Away  The Hooters casino advertises         in free slot play when you join their slot club  We called to ask   quot What s the catch  quot  and were told there was no catch  When we got there  the free slot play was only for a small  roped off section of machines  We also got some useless coupons  including one for a free drink at a hotel bar that did not open for several hours  We were so turned off by Hooters  deceptive advertising practices that we left and did not go back  
N =>   I was a bit disappointed I stayed here with my brother for two nights in e     I was kind of surpised to find the property a bit shabby  My first impression was in the parking garage and elevator  Both were filthy  The elevator drops guest out    somewhere      and it took some suitcase dragging through the casino to find the check in desk  The check in clerk was friendly and make check in easy and painless We went up to our room on the   th floor and found a pair of full size beds  I thought those disappeared with I Love Lucy   The elevator was slow and reminded me of an old elevator I rode in a Hungarian hotel a few years ago  More importantly  no coffee pot in the room  A full pot of coffee delivered to the room by room service was about         That was really lame  Getting coffee in the morning was a hassle and expensive   I think about       a cup downstairs in the crowded gift shop The bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably clean  albeit small  poorly lit and drab  The windows were filthy and hard to look out of  The air conditioner worked OK  I found this room to have less than average storage  drawers or places for my stuff   A TV armoire with a broken shelf was about it  with the exception of a standard motel closet with about   hangers  The room did have an electronic safe that worked   I did not have any encounters with hotel staff  All in all  it was not a bad value  but nothing to write home about  I expected a cleaner  more well maintained property  It was no so bad that I would never stay there again  the rate would just have to be very low  like              a night  to match up with the Fremont Street like grunge feel  
N =>   More positive than negative We went to Vegas on our first trip and didn t know where to stay   I did alot of research and needed specific times to fly out so we booked seperately    I came upon Hooters while searching for a good bargain  The prices seem great for our budget and at first I was not happy that it was not on the strip  But come to find out it was right across from MGM so it didn t seem to be too far   and it was not at all  We reserved a while in advanced and it was the bungalow   there were alot of reviews that were bad but we took our chances  Upon arrival  checkin was not long and we were given another room  The Room was great    I don t know why people complained soooo much about this place   it was nice  We are not cheapos but this our first trip so we wanted to be conservative   we knew we would not be there long  The room was clean  cold and of ample size   we were above the pool and could not really hear anything   the a c was not overbearing   and the beds were to die for     I have paid more in the past for other places and they were horrible  We were so glad with our choice and plan to go back there again    the only downslide is that some of the Hooters girls were kinda rude and had attitude like their you know what didn t stink   and they were not even that cute   food at Hooters restaurant was great and Dan inos Breakfast was good tooo especially the fruit  It was nice there too because all the other Hotels were sooooooo freakin huge and the walk to our room was nothing and convenient  the slots were okay but not great but who cares there hundreds more to enjoy on the strip    Also the free slot pay is a joke      Yet the coupons we got made up for it   The cleaning staff were nice ande didnt enter when we asked them not to and offered fresh towels everytime we saw them   great hard workers     FYI take a cab to and from the airport it is about nine bucks the shuttles are more just mention to not take the highway    They will try to scam you  Anywhoo  we enjoyed our stay there and hope you will too and fancy amenities are for those who like to blow money   I had more money to shop eat and gamble     Have fun 
N => 	 Days stay at HOOTERS This hotel was exellent value for money  The staff on reception were very helpful  HAPPY  and even upgraded us to kingsize rooms which were very roomy in the Tower Block  We viewed the bungalow rooms in the old part of the building but they left alot to be desired  The staff in the shop were not so happy and not so helpful  Pool area was very clean   waterfall out of use   Food was ok  didnt go a bundle on the chicken wings tho tasted disgusing  but other people seemed to like them  Coffee was exellent value  if you bought a Hooters mug  your coffee was free for the whole of your vacation  A little disappointed that there was no chill out area ie lounge with comfy seats to sit and relax and drink your coffee  The choice was either drink it at the machines  or take it to your room  there are tables and chairs outside but the temperature being    degrees wasnt an option for us Overall this hotel is exellent value for money right next to MGM and other major hotels on the strip  and only     taxi ride to the airport  
N =>   Excellent Hotel cool casino   recommended  We booked a boys  trip to Vegas in il      and on a friend s recommendation  we chose Hooters Hotel Casino for our accommodation ArrivalWe flew to LA from London and drove straight to Vegas that night  meaning that by the time we reached the City  we were shattered   so hoped for no issues at check in  We weren t disappointed  The guy on the desk called up our details straight away and directed us to our to twin rooms in the  Tower   You enter the hotel through the casino  so are immediately greeted with the sights and sounds of Vegas   and of course  the site of the Hooters girls The RoomThe rooms were clean  tidy and well decorated  There is an overall  beach  style to the place which is no bad thing  The room had two queen sized beds  a decent sized TV  a desk and  crucially  good air conditioning  The bathroom was a touch dated  but clean and had no issues  We were on a lower floor  so our outlook was a flat roof with air con ducts  but also the MGM Grand opposite  Our friends  room was poolside   but again  too low to see the pool over the flat roof  Still  if you are coming to Vegas to sit looking out your hotel room window  you might want to rethink your destination FacilitiesWe didn t use the restaurants in the hotel  but they were always busy which is usually a good sign  The bar by the pool was nice  and a good place to stand around sipping cool beer  We used the casino a few times and liked it a lot  Far less pretentious than the big Strip casinos and good fun  LocationGreat location  Just off the strip  but literally across the road from the MGM Grand  so not far away  We did a couple of day trips   Lake Mead for example   and the hotel was the right end of town to drive there  Big car park so no problems there Any problems Vegas is a   x  city and as such  you have to accept that there will be times when there will be noise at times that anywhere else would be unacceptable  After our       arrival from LA  we checked in and then hit the strip  returning at  am  At  am  what sounded like    girls  but was probably only      of them  arrived back to the room next door and made a lot of noise for an hour or so  This was all the more of an intrusion due to there being a  locked   adjoining door between our rooms  OverallAn excellent hotel  in an excellent location  To be honest  we weren t sure what to expect  but were very pleasantly surprised to find Hooters to be an excellent place to stay  
N =>   Worst Hotel Room Ever    The room and housekeeping was atrocious Window was filthy Sheets smelled mildewed  I called housekeeping twice to have them changed and they were never changed in the three nights we were there  Luckily the room had two beds and we slept in the other one  Sheets were not changed for that one either Had to call housekeeping each day for hand towels  They supplied us with bath towels and washcloths  but for some reason they hoarded the hand towels The floor was not vaccumed when we first arrived  Little specs of paper was on the floor The ice bucket liner was not changed the entire time we were there The sink stopper was broken  Sink wouldn t hold water The shower curtain was tied in place with a towel This had to be the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in  I told the manager and I was give a     food voucher for the restaurant  The staff was friendly I would not recommend  
N =>  Clean Room I was a bit scared booking here after reading some of the reviews  our room was just fine  yes it s average  I guess if your used to staying at the Wynn or Bellagio it wouldn t meet your expectations  It was a clean  average room  the beds were clean and so were the bathrooms  Our room was not ready when we arrived because we were about   hours early so they upgraded us from standard to ocean view tower without a problem for free  They also have the        promotion going on which is sort of a joke  didn t win anything on the promotional machines  but hey  it was fun with their money anyway  The walk to the strip was not bad at all  maybe   or   minutes  and you don t have to hike through miles and miles of casinos to find your room  I think the only complaint I had were that working vending machines were hard to come by  there is a store right downstairs  and if you leave your window open it smelled like chicken wings  I think we would stay here again for our next trip if it s still around  
N =>  not as bad as i thought it d be Found this place on hotels com for        a night  For that price  I thought  quot why not  quot  first impression   very bad valet service  I had to wait about    minutes for them to come out and take my keys  and it wasnt like the valet was busy  I was the only one waiting to have my car parked  after checking in  we went up to the room which was on the  th floor of the ocean view tower  The hallway smelled kinda bad  musty like  The room itself wasnt too bad at all  Beds very comfy  room pretty clean  and decorated in a tacky but cute hooters decor   like a beach florida type theme The only two coplaints with the room was the air conditioning was very noisy  and there was MOLD on the shower curtain liner  My other complaint was the pool area   nice pool area  and they had a really cool looking pool bar  When I was there    days at the end of may  the weather was hot  in the mid   s  and the pool bar never opened all in all  not bad if your just going to sleep in the room and be out in vegas all your waking hours  
N =>  A dump The room was an unmitigated dump  The carpet was polka dotted with cigarette burns and something that was white  I don t want to know what  The walls were paper thin  The folks next door were not loud  but I could hear every word  Noise from the hallway and garage came right through  The light coming through the connecting door was bright enough to require me to put a pillow over my head to get to sleep  At one point I thought   quot at least the bathroom is clean  quot  A summary inspection proved that wrong  The floor was dirty  The faucet in the tub had been leaking so long  it had rusted out all metal parts below it Service  What service  I am told the hotel has been sold and won t be around long  No loss  
N =>   Clean and Comfortable We booked the Hooters Casino Hotel because of price and location  South strip  so no car needed   and because it had reasonable reviews in the Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas and on Tripadvisor  A no frills establishment  but the room was clean  the bed comfortable  The only problem was that our room was not ready at  PM as promised  The room was sufficient for our needs  we spent our days elsewhere and returned only to sleep  A good choice if you are just looking for basic and inexpensive accommodations  
N =>   Was OK will not stay again  Arrived at the hotel at noon  The chick at the desk acted like it was a problem that I tried to check in that early and made it very clear to me that no rooms would be available until  pm  which was fine   I gave her my card and she said the rate was      I booked for     but since I had no receipt showing that  I called the hotel and booked over the phone earlier that week  I was stuck paying the extra      No big deal Came back about     pm and our room was ready  Hotel room itself was big and the bed was comfy  There was dried paint split all over the floor of the bathroom under the sink and the carpet was dirty  Opened the window and had a great view of the south strip  Window was gross though  The worst part of the room was the A C unit  It was as old as dirt and when we turned in on it made this horrible grinding noise  We laughed at everything wrong with the hotel though because we knew it was going to be tacky  The A C was really a pain though trying to sleep  When we slept we just turned on the vent because it didn t make that noise until you hit the COOL button  Lo and behold in the middle of the night somehow the COOL came on  no one touched it  and the grinding noise wouldn t stop and we literally could not get the unit to go off  We pushed the OFF button several times and nothing  It just stayed on  even when we left for check out it was still on The staff here acts like they go out of their way for you but they don t  None of them have nice Hooters either  believe me I looked  The      in slot play you get isn t worth it  You re only allowed to play on the designated machines they have  Also check out is at   AM and housekeeping will come to let you know  They were knocking on our door at     AM to ask if we needed help getting our things together to check out This hotel is OK if you re on a REALLY tight budget  or just spend the extra     a night and get a cheap room at Excalibur   But I wouldn t stay here again and quite frankly  I m glad this place is getting sold and closed  
N =>  wow   WORST  FOOD  EVER  I m only writing this review to comment on Dan ino s restaurant  We stopped by shortly after midnight for their    cent Hooter s wings special  Being a big fan of Hooter s wings  I ordered    and was expecting to have a great late night meal  Wrong  When the wings arrived they had a pale  sickly look to them  They were drenched in grease and had minimal breading on them  On top of this  they were almost cold  As a guy who can devour almost anything no matter what it tastes like  I figured it didn t really matter what they would taste like as long as they filled me up  Well  after my first bite I almost vomited in my mouth  Keep in mind that I have NEVER turned down a meal before and I am NOT a picky eater  The taste of the wings was indescribable   something along the lines of   week old dead roadkill  perhaps a possum  drenched in greasy raw sewage  Disgusting  The crazy thing is that I was actually able to eat   of them in the half hour we were there  We were placing bets on me eating all     but those would have to be the worst odds in Vegas  Everyone at my table had an identical experience  In total  we ordered    wings and only ate   of them  Not wanting to start anything  we just paid our bill and got the heck out of there  A short trip down the street to McDonalds and I was in heaven   it tasted like a   star restaurant in comparison  I have sworn off Hooter s completely at this point  I will never eat there again  Just thinking about it is causing me to get a lump in my throat  This was literally the worst food I have ever eaten in my    years on this planet  
N =>  LOVED Hooters   My boyfriend and I stayed here for the weekendand and we LOVED our room  I read some bad reviews so I was a little nervous going into the room  but it was nicer then the room I stayed in a few months ago at the Luxor  The bed was super comfy  and the room was very spacious  The only downfall was the maid service came around every morning and knocked to ask if you wanted our room cleaned  even if you had a Do not disturb sign  Everyone was super friendly and they had great deals on food  We even ended up staying an extra night   
N =>  Hooters was awesome Myself and   mates have just got back from   nights in vegas staying at Hooters   it was awesome  I had read the reviews and was a bit worried but neednt of been  The pool  casino and food were all good  The girls were obviously lovely and everyone really polite  It was a great stay and will definatley be going back  If you going with friends its a definate  couples   it depends what you like  Families really a no no There was a good mix of males and females which was surprising but good to see  Thoroughly enjoyed it all  
N =>   Loved Hooters We stayed at Hooters il              We really weren t sure what to expect of the rooms  but had been to the casino before and loved it  We checked in early and they found a room for us an hour before check in  Second floor oceanview tower  king sized bed  As far as standard rooms  it was very spacious  The bed was super comfy  I felt like I was melting into it  The only downside to the room was that the bathroom  while big with a tub  was kind of dark As far as gambling goes  the dealers were all very pleasant  There was always a cocktail waitress nearby  We ate at Hooters   times  Of course  we do love the wings All in all  I would stay here again in a heartbeat  
N =>  Worst Stay in Las Vegas I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino in il      and it was the worst hotel that I visited in Las Vegas  The hotel room had bed mattress with bed bugs  the bathroom was dirty upon checking in  the sink in the bathroom was clogged up  and the Internet was not working  Upon complaining to the front desk it took over an hour for the maintenance staff to show up  I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone else  
N =>   Lots of fun at agreat price I know it s not the first place you think of when you are going to Vegas  But you should give it a try  I really like the location  Your not on the strip but you are really close and you don t have to pay strip prices  Lots of fun   Clean room  Great Price Lots of freebies  
N =>   Fun and affordable Booked through their web site  and got a     per night rate  I thought it was too good to be true  but it wasn t  They even upgraded us to a tower room for free  and let us check in early  The dealers were personable  and the drink service is THE BEST IN VEGAS  I couldn t finish a drink before they brought me another  It can t compare to other casinos as far as decor and frills  but if you want to have a good time in a laid back atmosphere  Hooters is the place  
N =>   Not Impressed Date  ruary         Traveler from MinnesotaI just returned from a few day get away to Las Vegas  I chose Hooters Casino and Hotel for the price but also checked out the reviews and saw it was rated a   star Hotel  I was originally given a room on the   th floor that I was so unimpressed with along with the drain in the bathroom sink hardly draining at all that I thought it was a fluke and asked for a different room  The  nd room was even worse  The first thing I wanted to do in the  nd room I was given was turn the fan on  Not only was the lid that you flip up to adjusted the temp  cracked but it fell off in my hand  In the bathroom the sink drained a bit better  though it still backed up  but when I took my shower the next morning I ended up in standing water that came to within       inches from the top of the tub  I called the maintenance people and asked that they fix the drainage problem in the tub  The  quot fix quot  was done while I was out that day and when I took my next shower  the standing water was  quot only quot  up to my ankles not half way up my shin  There was also a lightbulb out in the bathroom the entire time and a plastic tag that was on the floor by the door that was never vacuumed up I am not a picky person about my hotel rooms but with the water drainage problem and over all ick feel from the room  I would never recommend this hotel  I would strongly suggest spending a bit more money for a better room at a better hotel  
N =>   Perfect for the right traveler s  If you are trying to decide where to stay for your next visit to Las Vegas  consider Hooters for these reasons      We have stayed at Mirage Treasure Island Ceasars Flamingo Harrahs Excalibur Luxor Hilton Bally s  We have gambled in a lot more  Although none of our group did very well gambling this last trip  we all agreed on one thing  Hooters was the friendliest  most fun casino we have ever been in  hands down  This opinion was shared by my wife  This could be because Hooters does a good job hiring  or  more likely   because their dealers get to keep their own tips  Unlike most other casinos that  quot pool quot  their tips  each dealer gets to keep whatever tips he she receives  In other casinos  one good dealer is typically followed up by   or   bad or very bad ones  Unfriendly or distant is how many dealers at other casinos always come across  but NOT at Hooters  The worst dealer at Hooters was more fun that     of the dealers at most other places  We have always liked Harrahs becuase they seemed to have a little higher number of happy  friendly dealers  Hooters even blew them away  I guess if your  quot style quot  of play is to treat the dealer as an  quot adversary quot   and don t care about socializing with them  then you might not care for the casino  If however  you like to  quot play quot  when you play  Hooters casino is for you    Hooters is not right on the strip  but it shares a parking lot  basically  with Tropicana  and is directly across the street from MGM  It is very easy to get anywhere you want  The taxi line was never very long  and you were right across the street from the monorail  Hooters is a small casino  so if you like the huge casinos  we get lost    then Hooters is not for you  If you like small and comfortable  and friendly  see      then you ll like Hooters  Plus you are right next to the largest casino in Vegas  MGM  if you want to change things up    Hooters is generally much less expensive than the bigger strip casinos  You will not get a      a night Venetian Suite at Hooters  for     or whatever   but you will get a nice  clean room with a comfortable bed  Hooters upgraded us when we checked in just because they had a nicer room available  Others in our group had standard  tower  rooms that were clean and comfortable  not terribly fancy  There is some signs of wear  some interior doors did not close properly  and there were some other signs of depreciation  but really  you had to be looking for problems  The room views are generally nice of the strip or the mountains  one of our rooms looked out over the pool  which isn t so nice in ruary but probably is pretty awesome when the pool is actually in use  Because it sits back from the strip  the views are generally not obstructed by the monsters on the strip  one of the worst views we EVER had was in an upgraded Ceasars suite   We would complain  however  about the manner in which Hooters placed the spotlights on the hotel facing toward the strip  our room   once the lights came on  it was a little like a police helicopter with a million watt spotlight was hovering outside the window  I think they could reposition the lights to be more indirectly shining into the guest rooms  However  this is not big enough of a problem to lessen our overall enthusiasm for the property    Service was generally friendly and prompt  We had a problem with our room safe on day one  and they were in the room in       minutes after our call  We have had problems at other Vegas properties that took days to take care of  Overall we were very satisfied with the service at Hooters    We ate at both main Restaurants  Hooters and inos  We had a good steak at inos  but felt that they may have lowered the quality  and prices   to appeal to a broader array of customers  It was not quite the quality dining experience we hoped for  Hooters on the other hand was a Hooters  We are not  quot Hooters regulars quot   I have probably been in a Hooters     times in my life  and my wife has been in one only one other time  It seemed pretty standard compared to the others I ve been in  ent food  decent price  decent service    Our group had people age from          including men and women  Everyone agreed that the hotel and casino met or exceeded all of our expectations  and offered outstanding value If this casino existed when I was younger  I cannot imagine that I would have gone anywhere else  The dealers are not all  quot Hooters Girls quot   and included men and women in button down shirts  HOWEVER  the Hooters Girls that were dealing were in many cases  quot model beautiful quot   Top that off with their friendliness  and any heterosexual single man  and probably too many married ones   were really in seventh heaven  This is not a place to be a drunken slob and disrespect the employees  plenty of security ready to help you out to the street   but if you were there for fun  and can behave  you ll have a blast All of the Hooters employees  including the  quot hottest quot  Hooters girls  seemed to go out of their way to make my wife feel comfortable  She really had a good time  However  she did feel uncomfortable getting in a cab by herself at Ceasars and telling the driver to take her to Hooters  I was working and she was shopping   That uncomfort was probably exascerbated by the jerk responding  quot whoo hoo  quot   Only you know what kind of couple you are  and if the  quot Hooters quot  name is too much for you or not In conclusion  if you are looking for a fun  convenient  smaller  clean buy not necessarily luxurious place to stay in Vegas  I think you d have a hard time finding a better choice and value  Being a Vegas  quot veteran quot   half the battle is determining a good  quot match quot  for your groups  quot personality quot   Hooters was a very pleasant surprise for us  Wherever you end up  remember  don t take more than you can afford to lose  and then have a great time   
N =>  Dirty It was very dirty and not organized there were nasty stains from the last people  They did not get cleaned up  I will never stay there again and customer service sucks I do not recommend staying there  The only thing that was half way decent is the ladies 
N => 		 A Night Poolside  We visited Las Vegas last week for my moms birthday  We stayed at HOOTERS because the casino is small  close to the strip  and was a heck of a deal  We found        a night for two doubles  We stayed in the BUNGALOWS  This used to be the SAN REMOS hotel  Built probably in the    s or    s  The room was clean  and the bedding was great  The bathroom was obviously older  but not a big deal  We were expecting the VENETIAN  The room we had was     We had to use a key to get into the building as well as back in from the parking lot It was convenient to the car  and casino  No multiple elevators  or hiking for an hour if you left something in the car  We were poolside  and the fire pit was outside our window  The noise level was a little higher then other hotels  again with age   We signed up for the member card that took a while  slow moving line  But it was worth it  We received a coupon book          worth of slot play and free tickets to see BOBBY SLAYTON  amp  ROBERT DUCHAINE  These tickets sell for almost        a person The Hooters rest was good  I normally dont eat there so I cant compare  But Dan inos left a bit to be desired  slow service  considering that is was after midnight and the wing special was advertised allover the hotel All in all    This was a great deal  and we had no complaints  
N =>  Hotel Nightmare It was the worse hotel I ever stayed  They sent staff      A M  in the morning using high pressure water jet to clean the vent on the roof top  My room just next to it  I tried to compliant to the manager on duty  have no response  and stay that was routine maintance  For me I have to suffer the unbearable noise until      a m  And I have to work     a m  in the following morning  I will let everyone that I know about the terrible stay of the century  
N => Thanksgiving at Hooters For the  th year in a row  we headed to Vegas for Thanksgiving  We were a group of          depending what day it was  Most stayed at the Flamingo on the strip  however  my husband  amp  I decided to try Hooter s Hotel  amp  Casino  It s convenient location to the monorail and the great rates we received  Why Not Check in was a breeze  We reserved a downstairs bungalow  The room was small  but cute  amp  had a slider door to a patio  We were there   days   nights  amp  everything was great  Good service on the casino floor  amp  we even won a little bit of moolah We are planning a return trip in ust for our nephews   st birthday   Can t think of a better place to celebrate a   st bday  
N =>  I am always happy with Hooter s This was the second time I have stayed at Hooter s since the remodel  The first time was literally the weekend after it opened  the rooms weren t finished but hey  it was a place to sleep  Our most recent visit we were originally put into a room with two full size beds     so not comfortable  My husband asked if we could be relocated to a room with a king size bed     the room was so much better  The bed was comfy    all in all I was very pleased  I love this casino because if you go with a group people are easy to find because the casino is so small  We never had a hard time getting drinks and the casino seemed to pay out for everyone in our party  The food on the other hand  not so good  same with the service  My husband loved the bacon at the Dam restaurant but they have closed this so now all the casino offers is Dan inos and Hooters  Dan inos is terrible  terribly slow service and rude employee s  The Hooter s  lets just say you pay for what you get  The girls are hot but lacking customer service   But I have to say I love this Hotel    I just don t eat here  
N =>  Not worth the money  We decided to stay somewhere new in Las Vegas and did we make a mistake  We thought Hooters would be fun  but were we wrong  Besides the fact it was New Years and we paid         per night  In some cases more than MGM and New York New York  thinking it would be different  We were not greeted with cute little Hooters girls but quite the opposite  The only place you see the cute Hooters girls are in the restuarant in the back  the problem here is that the line is always long to get it  Then when you get in the service is not good The casino is very smoky  and has people in it from somewhere else Then our room was so plain  the air conditioner was broke and we were told the night we arrived  after the engineer had been up   times to check it  that it was not to be fixed until the next week  They did offer to move us the next day but fortunately it got colder outside plus I did not want to pack everything up again We will never stay here again   
N =>   Won t be back    It was a clean place to sleep    that s really it  Terribly rude staff in Dan ino s  a man got up and left it was so bad  and poor service in Hooters  a pretty face in orange shorts doesn t make up for the lack of service  one customer was so disappointed with the service she made a big scene   Walls are thin  Another family on our floor had children  and you could hear every word they said  The Hooters Casino Hotel website said there were  quot complimentary coffee stations quot  in the rooms  Our room didn t have one  and when we inquired about it  they gave us a blank stare  and told use we would have to gamble in the casino if we wanted free coffee  All with an air of rudeness Stay away from the Tahiti Village booth  The Tahiti Village staff make you think it s part of the Owl Rewards Club and you tell them which room you re in  etc  Turns out that Tahiti Village is not connected to Hooters  and they just have a booth in the hotel  Tahiti Village is a timeshare property  and they will give you tickets to a show if you go to a two hour presentation  and put a deposit on your tickets   We mistakenly thought it was part of the Rewards Club and gave them our room number  THEN they gave us the timeshare rundown  and we weren t interested  They called our room on three separate occasions and left somewhat harassing messages  This isn t necessarily something Hooters can help  but they do allow Tahiti Village to have a spot within their hotel and market to  i e   harass  their customers  Because we felt like we had to continually avoid they Tahiti Village harassers  and because of the general rudeness of the staff  we spent little time in the Hooters casino    go across the street to MGM  It s much nicer  and the staff are a lot friendlier  The two stars are for the clean room and a decent location  We won t be back  and don t recommend this hotel  
N =>  What a great place We looked for a hotel just off the strip  close to the action  We came to see the various cirque de soleil shows  and wanted to be close to the vemiues  Hooters filled the bill perfectly W e had a large  clean  updated room where everything worked  No noise  no bugs  no smell  the elevator arrived within seconds on most occasions  It certainly wasn t posh  but we weren t paying posh prices  Only fault was that there wasn t a dresser for clothes  and you had to pile your stuff in the bottom of the tv cabinet  Staff was friendly  adn after a while  got to know us  We were across the street from MGM  and thought  quot great quot   we can stay at the Hooters  and use the facilities of a  quot real quot  vegas hotel  After a few days  we realized how much better it was at Hooters  and ended up using their facilities  At MGM and other large casino hotels  you walk for what seems like miles to get to the various restaurants  shops  the pools etc  and wait in line  Everythign at Hooters was convenient   the pool was right next to the elevators  several restuarants and bars within a few steps  there wasn t the  quot zshoom quot  of hundreds of people in the lobby  restaurants  etc   The casino was small and uninspiring  the mega casinos seemed to be a lot more fun  But we didn t come to gamble   our daily limit was         and we had fun visiting many of the different casinos  all of which were welcoming  despite our limited wagers Perhaps others had bad luck during their stay at Hooters   ours was really good   
N =>   Good Service    needs some improvements First  let me say that I am not usually too picky  Although I have been fortunate to stay at some very nice hotels on the strip  I have also stayed at my share of lower end hotels  Clean and comfortable are all I really care about  The check in process was friendly  quick  and we got the rooms locations we requested  Although we were there at      our room was already available which was nice  The rooms are remodeled and attractive  There were no bad smells which I have experienced in non smoking rooms in other Vegas hotels  The beds were very comfortable  The comforter and pillows were pretty  however after looking closer at the matching decorative bed pillows  we noticed small stains that appeared to be blood on them  Yuck  A few stains on the carpet but not enough to make a big deal of  The bathroom   needs work  The toilet barely flushed half the time  We were scared it was going to overflow  The tubs appear old and the drainage is slow but all in all  it s adequate  The Dam Restaurant and Dan ino Restaurant were both very good with great service  Nobody in our group won anything at the casino although it was a nice comfortable size and not too smokey  The two gift shops offer some great unique Hooters gifts and they stay open quite late to make it easier to shop after the night out  A group of younger guys would probably be perfectly happy at this hotel  I think most others would be satisfied enough even with the few problems  How often are you really in your room anyway  It s Vegas  
N =>   ent but not great I stayed at this hotel from         The hotel overall wasn t bad  The casino was a bit small  amp  ranked very low in my book when I compared it to the other casinos on or next to the strip  I would refer this hotel to the       age male traveling groups  amp  no one else  Its like a Holiday Inn Express with a Hooters restaurant inside  
N =>  Good to the next to last drop We just returned from staying at the Hooters Casino in Las Vegas  We found the employees to be very friendly and it is in a great location  We had an enjoyable time until   minutes before we checked out  More on that later We are among the unfortunate few who stayed at this hotel in recent years when it was still the San Remo  Based upon that  our expectations going in were very low  We were greeted by enthusiastic front desk people  Our  quot Ocean Front quot  room was spacious by Vegas standards  with a King size bed  desk  dressing area and bar table with stools  The bed was as comfortable as anything you ll find in more upscale hotels  The carpeting was stained in a few places  but otherwise  the room was clean with no offensive odors The dressing mirror and counter was a nice touch  but there weren t any electrical outlets there  On the nearby desk  however  there was a powerstrip and computer connection The bathroom was nice and again kept clean  We stayed three nights and the housekeepers did a nice job maintaining the room For gamblers  there is a greater variety of table games than the casino offered when it first opened  The     minimums kept many of the Hooters clientele from gaming  Even on Friday and Saturday nights  you could find empty seats at the tables  The Casino Royale on the strip  with their lower table limits and liberal cocktail service  seems to cater more to the    to    year olds that were staying at Hooters The only hiccup came the morning we were checking out  Hooters has a    hour cafe called the DAM Restaurant  We arrived at      a m  to eat breakfast  We were seated and the hostess put breakfast menus in front of us  We ordered two of the English Muffin breakfasts  The waitress said we couldn t have that because breakfast didn t start until       As we walked out  she apologized and asked if we could just wait five minutes  My question to her was   quot if you don t serve breakfast until    why give someone a breakfast menu  quot  It s not like this is an inexpensive place  Their breakfast menu started at       and went up  We stayed here as part of a package and got a great deal  While the overall experience was good  it s not worth the      rack rate they advertised for a weekend night  
N =>  Sexy hooters girls   The girls were great  Coming from Ireland it was some change to see these girls   though wouldn t wanna live there Check in spot on  quick  stayed on  th floor  Nice room    double beds  v confortable  Cleaned every day if wanted  Food in restaraunts v good  salads even tasty  Casino was good too  small and friendlier Only fault was the fact that access to reception was through whole building to get there Location good  just beside mgm  amp  nyny And again beautiful girls  
N =>   Welcomed by cockroach in bathroom We went to Vegas for the Badgers vs  UNLV game  We were traveling with a group of about   couples from WI  My husband and I were the first to arrive in Vegas and Hooters on         We had been on planes since  am and it was now  pm our time and it was HOT in Vegas  All I wanted to do was get a cold beer and change my clothes  Upon arrival they have brilliantly placed the bar right next to check in  I was able to satisfy my first desire by ordering a cold beer  Check in was great  Easy and quick  Although  for some reason we got   double beds instead of a king  No biggee  me and the hubby will snuggle  We proceeded to our room     in the Bayview tower  The room sort of look like the pictures  The decorations were all what I expected  What I didn t expect were the stains on the carpet or the rust on the bathtub  There was also cracked  peeling paint on our bathroom walls  The view left a lot to be desired  We could see the back of MGM along with the exhaust fans on top of the Hooters roof and parking garage  Not much for an inspiring view  However  really for the price and it being Vegas I wasn t expecting a palace  Just something clean and functional  I immediately opened my suitcase and grabbed some cooler clothes  I went into the bathroom to change  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something scurry across the wall into the corner by the mirror  I looked closer to find an insanely large COCKROACH  First of all  I have never seen a live one  Second  I have never seen anything that big except on like the Discovery Channel  Disgusting   I made my husband kill it  I am not a prude  though  One bug isn t going to scare me off  Although  now I was inspecting every nook and cranny of that room  I didn t find any of it s friends so we carried on and left to go to Downtown Las Vegas for the day  We returned late that evening and ordered room service  Room service was good and prompt  I took a shower that night  Which led to another discovery  My shower curtain had mildew all over it  I was so tired and so sweaty from the     degree heat I just didn t even care  I carefully washed up trying desperately to not let any body part make contact with the shower curtain  Gross  The next morning I was walking around the carpet barefoot while we made plans for the day  I went to get dressed and put on my shoes  As I leaned over to put on my socks I noticed the bottoms of my feet  To my horror they were dirty and black  Did I mention I took a shower the night before  Yep  all I walked on that morning was the carpet in our hotel room  Puke   This was my final straw  I was now just grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place  I called the Manager  Wendy  I told her about the bug  shower curtain  and my feet  She seemed very calm and non responsive  Even started telling me how yes  bugs in the desert are bigger  They seek out moisture and sometimes come in through the vents  I kept thinking  ok  but I am EIGHT floors up   Also  why is she telling me this like it is something that is common  If I am customer service or a Manager at a hotel I would not want my guests to think there are more bugs  I would act completely appalled and tell them that is unheard of and apologize profusely  She finally asked if I would like to change rooms  She said the set of rooms I stayed in are not as nicely renovated as the Oceanview ones  She could change my room and the bellman could help us  We just had to do it before  pm that night  We already had plans for the day and were about to walk out the door  I told her I would call her back and we would try to meet the  pm deadline  Problem was  we had completely unpacked our suitcases  I told her if we didn t meet her deadline then at the bare minimum I would like my shower curtain replaced  I mean really is that all she could offer  To inconvenience us more by making us pack back up and now moving into another room basically identical to ours  but  quot possibly quot  in better shape  We ended up going out with our group of friends  having loads of fun on the strip  and did not get back until late  Past the  pm deadline  However  we did notice our shower curtain had been changed by the cleaning service  What we also did was from the night before when we ordered room service was accidentally drop a french fry by our bed  We joked that morning about it and I said that would be my test to see if they cleaned it up  Yeah  it was still there  Beds were made  Towels and toiletries replaced  but that stupid french fry was still there  This became our gauge on how well the cleaning crew performed  Yep  that french fry never moved the entire   days we were there   I  personally  don t think they vaccum  I never saw a vaccum by one of the cleaning carts  I did see a man vaccuum the hallway once outside our door  but that was it  I also question whether they sweep the bathroom  I dropped a rubberband one morning and the next day it was still there  I think they simply change your towels  empty trash cans  give you toiletries  wipe the sink tub  and call it a day  Even glasses and empty soda cans weren t thrown out for us  Like they thought we were going to the local recycler or something  I don t know       In WI our hotels clean top to bottom  be that isn t the norm in Vegas  No  that cannot be this is like our  th time in Vegas and never have I seen such poor cleaning in a casino hotel  Especially a hotel that is realitively new to Vegas  has a well established brand  and is trying to make a name for itself as a Vegas strip hotel competitor  Unbelievable  Therefore  if you like creepy crawlers  black dirty feet  stained up carpets  and living in trash  By all means stay at Hooters  Its  cheap  but you have to be willing to comprimise on clean  Trust me your not getting any sort of Vegas Strip luxury hotel staying here  YIKES      We took pictures  I am in process of getting them developed  I will post them as soon as I do  The only thing we missed was the bug  My husband killed it and flushed it down toilet before I could snap a picture  Seriously  it was the size of a walnut  Makes me shiver thinking about it    Sincerely a Grossed Out Badger Fan 
N => Overall OK but some problems I stayed at Hooters y       as part of a private Parrothead Party  The hotel offered special rates for our group  so can t complain about the price  During our stay  one of the three elevators to our tower ceased to work  It was not repaired while we were there  The hall carpet was stained and appeared to be filthy  found someone else s hair in the bathtub  and generally was not so clean  In the hotel s defense  the beds were very comfortable and clean  the staff was very friendly and helpful  there was a nice pool area and tiki bar  Would not be my first choice of places to stay in Vegas  but was convenient for our group s party  
N =>  Great Time  My husband and I and another couple choose Hooters for the price and were not disappointed  We stayed there      to     Check in was fast and friendly  even got free tickets to the comedy show there Rooms were clean and nice  our view was of the strip The pool was fun and lively but the pool service was poor  we had to get our own drinks even thou there were several girls walking around The casino was fun  youthful and had great service The wings were great and so was the Key Lime pie at the Dam resturant We will stay there again  
N =>  DIRTY  I have never written a review about anything  I feel very strongly that people need to know my version of the truth about this hotel  First of all  I would like to say that I have no complaints about the staff  Everyone there was very friendly and helpful  They were also very eager to compensate for our dissatisfaction  Upon arrival at the hotel  everything seemed fine  The reservations were correct  thank you Vegas com   The room availability at the time of check in was either two queen beds or one king bed in the bungalows  A bungalow  overlooking the pool  sounds fun  huh   We give our bags to the bellhop and head up to our room  The room was located outside of the hotel casino structure  Walking through the pool area was a must to get to it  We opened the door to get in the building and immediately were taken aback by the smell in the hallway  It smelled just like a deep fryer  as my husband liked to say  I think it smelled more like someone had died  Being optimistic  we continue on to the room  We open the door  It is quite dingy and dark in the room  We stayed there for about an hour and a half until our luggage showed up at the room  we did have to call for it   Then we headed out to eat dinner  our first meal since breakfast   over dinner we decide that we can t stay in the room  It was just too dirty for our standards  We go talk to the receptionist and she was very accommodating  She said in about an hour she would have a room for us with a king size bed in the ocean view rooms  We were excited about this  She comes and gets me in an hour and my husband and I gather our things from the old room and move them into the new room  We immediately attempt to turn on the air conditioning  and what luck would have it  it wasn t working   las Vegas with no a c  not going to happen   Then I realize the sink in the room does not drain  We call for someone to come fix it  After   phone calls and    minutes later  the mechanic arrives  He fixes the a c  thank God  and attempts to fix the sink  He used this contraption that forced air through the pipes to remove any clogs there might be  This device managed to spray dirty  leftover  sink water onto the mirror and counter space  The man doing the work used the room towels to haphazardly wipe up the mirror and sink  I do have to say  for the quick fix it did work for about    hours    then the sink went back to overflowing if the water was running too long   we did not want to take the effort or our time to have someone come fix it The following day  after being at the pool all day  we come back inside to shower and get ready for the evening  My husband showers first and then I hop in    while I m in the shower the lights int he bathroom turn off     not any other outlet or light in the entire room   so I am condemned to taking a shower in the dark  With all of this aside the rooms  both of them  were filthy  There was a layer of dust on the artificial plants as well as the night stands and clock radio  The carpet looked as though it hadn t been vacuumed in a month  I was thoroughly disgusted  
N =>   no pool I stayed at Hooters in Las Vegas only to find out that we were unable to use the pool for   days due to a private party We had the option to use the pool Next door but if I wanted to use that pool I would have booked a room next door  Instead of Paying a        donation fee 
N =>  Rooms leave much to be desired I stayed here for   nights with my husband and best friend over the weekend  When we first arrived we got our room  no problems there  and headed to the elevators  We were in the Bay View Tower and only one of the two very slow elevators was working  When it finally came to get us  we went up to our floor and walked to our room  I did notice the carpets in the hallways were stained and everything just felt dirty  The room was ok  We had a view of the pool with a tiny balcony  one person size  and the two beds we requested  When we left the room we waited   minutes for the elevator to come get us before trying the stairs  The signage was very poor and while we were able to figure out a passage to the outside  by the parking garage  we couldn t get to the lobby level casino  So  we had to go back up the stairs to wait for the elevator again That night  after a long evening of drinking  we came up to bed  I woke up many times throughout the night due to the incredibly uncomfortable beds  All in all a pretty restless night of sleep  Then  at    PM  I know  it is noon  but it is Vegas   we were awakened to blaring music  A band had started playing at the pool and there was no chance of sleep after that b c everything could be heard The rest of the time was no better  The hotel became more and more trashed as the weekend went on and never seemed to be cleaned up  They did the individual rooms but the hallways remained disgusting  On Sunday morning  a trashcan of vomit was placed in the hall by the elevators and although I saw the maids several times all morning  it was still there when we checked out at   PM On the bright side  they do have good drinks  the Nipper Juice will knock you over with   kinds of rum and the pool is a good time  I also appreciated the location b c it was so easy to get to MGM and the monorail  I am a firm believer that a room is a room in Vegas and just a place to pass out   but if you can t get to your room  or out of it  due to slow elevators  you can t sleep b c your bed is uncomfortable and a band is playing and you hate walking thru the halls  maybe it is better to stay somewhere else  
N =>   Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else I booked three rooms three months in advance for the weekend at Hooters  After reading that the hotel seems to get your rooms wrong regularly I decided to call about four hours before our arrival and verify the rooms we requested were in fact the rooms we would receive  I was told no problem over the phone  We arrived    couples  and we given all wrong rooms  Two rooms were smoking  non smoking was requested  and one room has two beds  one was requested   We were told this was all the hotel had available  Once in our room we called the main desk and begged to be moved  the smell was awful   we were moved down the hall to a room with two beds  It was our anniversary weekend and did not want to sleep seperate  Called again and was told our prior room was all that was available  Now lets talk about the view from the rooms  second floor  our view was of an electrical box and the parking structure  our friends had a view of the ventalation system with a bunch of cigarette butts outside the window  Not very pretty  The lay out of the rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable  Casino was to small  played at other casinos that had tables open  Lastly they were filming a TV show at the pool and the pool was not open until      on Saturday  not very good when it s     outside  we were credited     dollars to the resturant  whooo hew       
N =>   Loved Hooters My husband called Hooters hotel back in ch to ask if they could do anything special for our   th anniversary in e  They told him to book a tower room and they would upgrade  When we arrived    no waiting line  they had upgraded us to a two room  hot tub suite  The room was beautiful   The king size bed was soft and very comfortable  The L shaped couch along with the     inch   flat screen TV made you feel right at home  It was like a small apartment and it had two bathrooms  The casino itself was small  not like the mega hotels  and had a great atmosphere  The servers came around often  The only bad thing was that the maintenance workers and housekeeping had to use the guest elevators as there are no service elevators for them to use  
N =>  Hooters Las Vegas Nevada We arrived at Hooters on Thursday and I really enjoyed staying there  The rooms were very nice and had very soft beds  I loved the casino  It wasnt huge like the rest of them  so you could find your way around easily  I would NOT recommed going to the Hooters restaurant  The service was TERRIBLE  My group ate there twice and we had to literally go and find a waitress to help us  It was pretty spendy and not that good  They girls looked like they were about    years old also  So if you dont want terrible service and spendy prices  go elsewhere The elevators were all working good and there was never a line to get on  The hotel was also in a very good area  not too far from the strip  The pool was very beautiful  but the sun is blocked by the hotel early  so you need to go to the pool about   am to get a good few hours in  So overall i would for sure stay there again  but i would NEVER go to the Hooters restaurant ever again there  
N => LOVED IT    I was a bit nervous   my husband and I wanted to go to vegas for our    year wedding anniversary and we got an incredible deal on this hotel  I read some reviews   got some feedback from others who have been to vegas  this was our first time  and so I was still nervous but bit the bullet  We had a WONDERFUL time  We got there early and rooms were not ready  you just drop the bags at the bell desk and off you go   we didn t mind the hotel at all  the room was clean the bed was comfy  and we didn t spend an enormous amount of time in our room   Some drawbacks   the elevator  very slow   it got stuck once with my hubby in it   and the water in the shower would go from scaulding hot to cold the entire shower   but its an older place   again for the money something I was willing to tolerate   we would love to go back and the location of this hotel is close to the airport  and also right off the strip  so we walked a lot to and from the bigger casinos   Its not something to be afraid of   the staff was nice  we had a great time and you will too  
N =>   Had a w owl of a time Have just spent   weeks at the Hooters Casino Hotel  Booking in was quick  but we did have to wait until     pm to get into our room The room was very clean  well set out with a large TV and enough space for clothing  The bathroom was adequate  the one cup at a time coffee machine was in there    but there was plenty of room for it next to the sink   The room had a bar stools and table in the corner  which we didn t use much  rather be sat in a real bar The bed was extra large and extremely comfortable  very soft  The only down side of the room was the noisy air conditioning unit  which rattled away during the day and night The casino itself was small by comparison with most of the others on the strip  and the bars in the casino got very noisy in the evenings  But the hotel does cater for the younger crowd  so the noise was to be expected The pool was nice if you could get near it  we struggled to get a sunbed most of the time  you had to be down there by      to get one  No one asked for any ID to get into the pool area  so anyone could have used the pool The hotel was only a five minute walk to the strip  and a five minute drive to the airport  we were ripped off by a taxi driver on the journey from the airport to the hotel  so make sure you only pay around    dollars for the trip We found the beer expensive in the hotel bars  much cheaper at other casino s like Bills  Overall the hotel was clean and the room adequate  but we didn t feel we could relax by the pool or enjoy the casino because of the noise  
N =>   Excellent Value for Money   Good Location I was slightly concerned about my choice of hotels after reading the mixed reviews but I needn t have worried The staff at check in were helpful and friendly  We were told that they didn t have any king size non smoking rooms available but would we be happy to accept a room with two double beds instead with the option of changing to a king size the next day  After a long flight though we were more than happy to accept this  The room was fine   a good size with very comfortable but very high beds  We had an excellent view of the strip and it was quiet  well  except for the air conditioning unit which was annoyingly loud    The rooms are nicely decorated but they are obviously not to Bellagio or Wynn standard  but you can t really complain when you re only paying     per night  Although everybody thinks of Hooters as a  party hotel  we didn t experience any excessive noise  One of the lifts was out of order for a day or so  which proved a bit of a pain  and they aren t air conditioned so when you re stopping on every floor from the   th in a small lift it can get a bit stuffy The hotel itself doesn t have a huge amount of amenities but enough to keep you happy  The casino is small and friendly and it makes a nice change from the other  super casinos  on the strip  There are plenty of Hooter girls to be seen although some seem more interested in chatting to customers rather than serving drinks I d definitely recommend staying here  especially if you ve stayed in one of the bigger hotels before and fancy a change  
N =>  Hooters this place is a hole Stayed at Hooters e       our second night our roof started leaking  we were on the top floor   floor      we had to get transferred to the  rd floor no comps for this   Manager was a retard would not even give us a free night   got the  rd floor room and the A C was busted someone did show up and they fixed it  all in all if you are on a budget its not bad   otherwise avoid this hole  
N =>  Just OK I arrived late Wednesday night and was able to get the room I requested  king  nonsmoking   The room was clean with a view of the pool  I will say the the beds are wonderful but they are put on a metal box to make them higher  I hurt myselft twice because part of the bed frame sticks out  One of the elevators was out for   of our   days so it made going up and down a long wait  On our  rd day our A C went out but it was fixed by the time we returned to the room  Housekeeping was good but we had several lights out that were never replaced and the smoke detector was left on the desk the whole stay  For the price the hotel was fine  We did have issues with the casino because the craps dealers pulled our bets incorrectly twice  so that was frustrating  If you are on a budget this hotel is good but I don t know if I would stay again  
N =>  Not a bad hotel but service wasn t great  Our stay at the Hooters was fine           it s a partying place  so definitely very upbeat and loud  But that s to be expected if you re going to this style hotel  The rooms were clean and neat  and we had a view of the pool  which was nice  Location isn t bad  either  just   block off the strip  Our only issue  was when we arrived at       am  and was told we had to wait until  pm to receive a room key       no problem  By  pm  after   checks with the clerks  we still did not have a room  and they were just then sending the maid to clean the room  They had told us they were sending the maid  x already  starting at  pm when we originally came for the key   At this point I was frustrated  as we had tickets for a show at    and needed to get ready  etc   so I asked our options  They replied   quot We don t guarantee check in time  nor do we guarantee the room you ve paid to receive  Just that you ll have  quot A Room quot  by the evening  quot  I have never heard of such a thing  Why on earth does one pay additional for a nicer room  if there s not a chance you ll get it    I wasted money without knowing it  So  whether it s the response of a grouchy clerk  or their customary policy  I would not recommend based on the service levels  Otherwise  it would be a decent  less expensive option in a pricey city               
N =>  Extremely poor customer service The reservations that we booked for our stay requested a king size bed  When we arrived we checked in with no problems  went up to our room and found   double size beds  My first agitation with them is they said nothing about this at the front desk  When we called to have the problem fixed they were less than helpful  and all they could say is that they only guarantee the smoking preference of the room and not the bed request  The attitudes of the staff was extremely rude and irritating because it was clear they could care less  We were told to call back the next morning for assistance in switching to a new room  The next morning we called and were told it was first come first served  I considered us first since we were there the day before requesting a king size room  They wouldn t even assist us  and kept saying they didn t guarantee the room and started to say they wouldn t even guarantee the smoking preference  Even the manager treated us rudely and wouldn t do a thing to satisfy the situation  I will never stay there again  and have told everyone I know it wasn t worth it  
N =>  NOT NEAR ENOUGH HOOTER GIRLS Stayed in the suite top floor  Room was OK  Staff was mostly friendly  Drink service at the pool was non existent  Location was good not near enough staff for the volume of people  
N =>   Loved Hooters My husband and I stayed at Hooters Easter week to renew our wedding vowels  we could not have been happier   Check in was a breeze  the girl at the counter offered us several rooms to choose from  we took one on the  th floor with a great view of the pool and the airport  We could lay in bed and watch the planes go up  We had NO noise problems at all  The room was very clean and welcoming  The bathroom sparkled with plush  thick towels  Housekeeping was on the ball  we would put the do not desturb sign up until we left for the day  flipped it over indicating the room was ready to be cleaned and it was when we returned  I can t say enough about the casino  we loved it   It was small enough that we didn t get lost  but big enough to have a great time and win enough to continue playing  We have stayed in other places on the strip in the past  but we will only stay at Hooters in the future  Don t worry about the  quot Hooters quot  girls  they are as nice as can be and very professional  most are just college girls trying to earn money  We actually passed up drinks while we were gambling  The location is great  you are only   blocks from the strip  there are sidewalks and walk signals All in all we had a GREAT time and will be going back in the future  DON quot T LET THE POOR REVIEW SCARE YOU OFF  IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY  
N =>   Terrible Service Terrible service  Would not honour non smoking even though our email confrimation stated it  Manager was inflexible and rude  Rooms were below average  No bedspread and they did not give us one during the entir   days stay  Room windows were filthy and whne opened a deep fry smell filled the room  Casino is dingy and girls are average  Would not return  Advice  spend the extra     per night and go elsewhere  
N =>   Fun  Redneck  Weekend We booked our stay at Hooters because we had previously visited the casino and it looked like a fun place to stay  The offer of two tickets to the Nascar race also helped in our decision  We already had tkts to Brooks  amp  Dunn s show so we took the chance  Despite some iffy reviews  we had a great time  The beds were great wanted to bring mine home  Pool area was nice  Staff was friendly  We had a late check in and had no problem  We would definitely stay there again  If you are looking for a smaller friendly place to stay in Vegas  give it a try  We did  
N =>  Great value for the money  This hotel was remodeled recently  and the update was great  The surfboard and palm tree theme was fun  I called early in the day to tell the hotel we would be arriving very late  but would still need a non smoking room due to my son s asthma  The front desk staff who took the call was extremely helpful  asked what we would like a view of  and reserved a room so it would not be an issue when we arrived late  He added that he would put us in for a late checkout since we were arriving after midnight  extra points  When we got there  we were starving  so we ordered room service at  am  having low expectations  The prices were standard room service rates  but I was astounded that the fruit plate included yogurt  a big muffin  granola  and a HUGE plate of wonderful fresh fruit  It was large enough for all of us to have a good helping of everything  The bathroom was very nice  very clean  and the towels were better than the towels at any big bucks hotel  The pool area looked great  though we didn t have time to enjoy  This hotel was a great value  
N =>   Great value and service for the money My husband and I recently stayed here and we were a bit skeptical at first  but had a great time  Here s some positives and negatives about our trip Positives Great price look to the Hooters website for the best ratesFriendly service Not everyone is runnning around in Hooters uniforms but everyone down to the chambermaid said hello to us on a daily basisSmall enough not to get lost in if you ve ever stayed at some of the larger hotels on the strip you know what I mean  The lobby was very easy to navigate with a fast check in serviceSmall but engaging gambling floor lots of slots that pay and lots of tables that were always busy including a hooters girl pit for those who just can t get enough  Great restaurants Hooters was above average compared to our local Hooters and Make sure you try the nachos at The Dam restaurant HOLY COW big enough for     people who are really hungry and they re good too    We had to have them twice while we were thereSuper comfortable beds  Clean rooms and great views from the ocean view towerHooters rewards club Make sure you join it s free  swipe your card on a daily absis to try for a million  but if you don t win  you still get free points towards cash back as well as free hooters stuff like t shirts  shot glasses  etc  We did our cheesy gifts form Vegas shopping this way Negatives  Room was a little low budget for Vegas but still nice just not a lot of glamSmell of smoke occasionally in the morning in our room   not sure why   Overpriced Hooters stuff but it s all overpriced in Vegas Pool could use some more landscaping  but it s still a super fun place  with an actual waterfall coming down  Very fun amotsphere  conviently located to food and drink access Overall we had a great low budget vacation in Vagas  and Hooters was the highlight  We just wish we had stayed at Hooters the whole time instead of switching to Hard Rock we actually came back to gamble and eat at Hooters while we stayed at the Hard Rock be sure to read my other review on that  
N =>  Not a bad place at all for the price We stayed a night here the first part of   I was highly skeptical  especially since it was   females  I was extremely impressed  The decor is cool  sort of beachy  surfboards  etc  The room is a really good size  with plenty of counter and desk space  It was clean  I have stayed in many of the enormous hotels in Vegas but what I liked about Hooters was the fact that it was relatively small  not a lot of walking from check in to our room  and not a lot of walking from the elevator to the rooms either  The windows in the room opened up too  which was nice for fresh air  but really not very safe  as they were low and a person could easly step right out   It was not pool weather but the pool did look pretty small  however we didn t walk around it to know more about it  
N =>  First Time in Vegas My stay at Hooters was part of my first visit to Vegas  I along with three other friends were on a three week road trip and Vegas was one of our last major stops so price was a major factor in our decision  We got a deal through Expedia where we ended up paying only     total for three nights  This unbelieveable deal gave us a little pause on the type of hotel and room we would find when we arrived in Vegas  but to our delight our room was clean  spacious and defintely worth every penny  The location was great too    It was directly across the street from the Monorail and steps away from Excalibur  the Tropicana  the MGM and New York New York to name a few major hotels  One complaint we had though was with internet  Although we knew they didn t offer a wireless option our friends did purchase ethernet service and were unable to use it  However  the hotel promptly refunded their money   but it definately was an irritant  Also  although the valets and housekeeping staff were excellent  the front desk upon check in was really sketchy  In fact  I thought it was funny that the individual checking us in  quot Robert quot  not only gave us the worst attitude but was also designated the trainer on his name tag  My professional work includes training and development and I think that with leaders in the work environment that treat customers in such an inappropriate way is definately not good business and should make this establishment think about who they place in those roles in the future  
N =>  Friendly fresh and convienent As a    year diehard feminist  whose work a lot of time involves working with women victims of violence  there have been a lot of times that I have to explain my deep love for Hooters restaurants   My fiance took me to a Hooters for a nightcap on our first date   Imagine how my love was heightened when they have added a casino to their line of restaurants  When I saw they were opening a casino   the old San Remo in Las Vegas I couldn t wait until it opened  A business trip right before New Year s weekend took my fiance  amp  myself there for   nights  It was fun  clean  amp  a very pleasant surprise  Their uniforms in comparison to the other casino s waitress is pretty tame  Also  the girls and guys on staff were all very friendly  Across from the enormous MGM this place was refreshingly intimate but big enough to serve our needs  I had been to the San Remo twice before  it used to have a great steakhouse  and in its ending days it was clear the place needed to be redone  Keeping the orginal setup for Hooters  the palm trees  white on orange decor is cool  bright  amp  hip The Dam Diner was a good value with good food  amp  friendly service  The Hooters was a run of the mill place but nice  The nicer Dan ino s was empty but nice    elegant  dark  amp  sleek  The martini bar with the TKO house band performing cover songs was nice too  The waitress was attentive and the drinks generous  The band is nice  amp  willing to play whatever the audience wanted to keep the dance floor packed  It was fun  The rooms were just redone    not much  just update furnishings  amp  painting but nice nonetheless  I loved having the Hooters bar table  amp  stools in my room     it made our nights festive for a drink of our own  Even the fake palm tree in the room with its kitcshy ness made for a nice visit  I highly endorse this property    I will definitely be back  
N =>   Very Dissapointed  We looked forward to visiting the  quot new quot  Hooters Hotel and Casino on our most recent trip  We found our room to smell like an ashtray and the water heating to be sub standard  As for the casino    YUK  It wasn t at all what we thought it would be  The staff was less than friendly  less than professional  and they sure didn t support a  quot fun environment quot   I think we ll just stay at home next time and go to our local Hooters and play cards  Hooters should be ashamed of this endeavor   it is not representative of their other operations  
N =>   mixed feelings also My husband and I reserved our room at Las Vegas  com  and we got a really great deal  One of the reasons we wanted to stay there was for the fact that Dan ino s resteraunt is in side that building  also for the fact that I am afraid of heights and elevators  When we found out they gave us the   th floor  and we were not aloud to use stairs  we went back to the front desk  and they quickly changed our room to a bungalow second floor out by the pool  It was lovely  The room was great and the service was awesome  The second night we were there however we wanted to get into the hot tub because it was very cold that night  We were told to get out of the hot tub  it was closed  even though it wasnt nearly ten yet   I thought in Vegas  nothing ever closes   We complained to the front desk about it  and they told us  well  we dont guests to get sick   because it was cold outside  The casino is small and smoky  but they are all smoky  but were from California   Dont eat at The Dam resteraunt for breakfast its awful  Other than that DO go visit Holly in the bar  she was a great person to hang around  
N =>   Not impressed with Hooters My wife and I just returned from a   night stay at the Hooters Hotel and Casino  We arrived in a good mood  but left disappointed We had reserved a non smoking room with a king size bed  However  during check in  we were informed that none of these rooms were available  After telling the young man at the registration desk that we had specifically reserved a non smoking room with a king size bed several weeks ago  he told us that Hooters doesn t accept reservations  only requests for rooms  and none of the rooms that we requested were available  This wouldn t have been that big of a deal if we hadn t traveled across the country and my credit card hadn t already been billed for our   night stay We asked for an upgrade  but were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms with   full size beds  but that we could be moved to the type of room we requested the next day  Since we didn t have any other options  we decided to accept his offer  I asked for a discount for the inconvenience  but was given four free drink coupons instead Our first room was on the second floor  The view out of our open  unlocked  broken sliding glass door was of some electrical equipment  The bed comforters smelled strongly of smoke  the water took over a minute to get hot  and it tasted moldy The next day  we had to wait until      PM for our  quot expected quot  room to become available  The water in this room still tasted moldy  but the water didn t take long to heat up since hot water was constantly leaking from the shower  This was more of a feature than a problem for us  This room also overlooked the pool area  which was a bonus  but it didn t change our impression of the hotel  Perhaps if we got this room from the start  we d be happier with the hotel The maids were the nicest people in the hotel  The staff at the registration desk were mixed  Some were very nice  some weren t The Hooters restaurant was good  but no different than any other Hooters restaurant across the country The casino is small compared to other nearby casinos  but this wasn t a big deal to us  since we don t gamble much This hotel is a   minute walk from the intersection of Tropicana Blvd  and Las Vegas Blvd  If you ve never been to Las Vegas before or stayed on The Strip  this probably won t be an issue  However  having stayed at New York New York last year  my wife and I agreed that it would be worth the few extra bucks a night to stay on The Strip in a newer hotel than save money by staying off the strip in this refurbished hotel  
N =>   Hooters is NOT a new hotel  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to Las Vegas  We booked our hotel online  when the price for the room showed up at what we thought was a too good to be true price  We called to talk in person to verify there was no mistake  We were instucted that the rate was a promotional rate because it was a new hotel  We were given a choice of tower rooms or poolside bungalows We chose a bungalow  BAD DECISION  First  there is nothing  quot new quot  about this hotel  It is a slightly refurbished group of old buildings  The bungalow room we were given was dirty  and rundown to say the least  As it was late in the evening we decided to  quot deal with it  quot  for the night  We attempted to clean our room  only to notice there were ants crawling all over the bathroom counter  Not to worry a few ants can t be that big of a deal  I will just take a quick shower and take care of things in the morning  Hah   Not a chance  unless a cold shower was good enough  after all it was a cheap rate  The hot water was almost non existent in the tub  I don t mean that the water would only flow cold  I mean water wouldn t flow at more than a trickle from the hot water faucet   this  quot new quot  hotel has old two handle faucets  probably got a good deal on them on E bay  The water flow wasn t enough to make the shower head spray  At least the bed had a comfortable mattress  Upon going to the front desk in the morning and bringing my concerns to their attention  I was informed  quot  What do you expect you booked the cheapest room in the place quot  After being insulted in a such a manner  I answered back  quot  I don t consider a clean  bug free room with running hot water to be too much to ask for  After a few more snotty comments from both sides I was informed  I would be moved to a tower room for the remainder of my stay  however they wouldn t be able to move me until the afternoon The remainder of my stay went off without any additonal problems  however I do not believe I will consider returning to a hotel where it is OK to allow a guest to pay the  quot asking price quot  for a room  misrepresent what that room is  then insult the guest for not paying more  
N =>  Felt very welcome We were not sure what to expect  but we were very happy with everything there  All the staff were very friendly and questions were answered right away  the pool area was nice the way they have it set up  no matter where you were sitting you had a good view of all the action going on  George the security guy by the pool was so very friendly even if he had to keep his eye on alot of things The room was just perfect  Well i was not to crazy about the colors  but who cares  the beds were so very  very comfortable  we were right behind the elevators and i worried about the sound  but that was doable also I would stay there again in a second  very close to things we wanted to see As a first time Black Jack player  i felt that the dealer was so nice to help explaine things and even when i lost I felt that she felt for me  nice  
N => Great Time Had By All Once again the staff at hooters were great  Everyone was so friendly and helpful  Nothing was any trouble  We will definitely stay there again next time we go to Vegas  The bed was the best we ve ever slept in  
N => Not a bad place to stay If you book the hotel in advance i would say you will get a better room We reached Las Vegas at   am in the morning and got room in this hotel The room was not appreciable ac duct was making lots of noice We also booked a room in the same hotel in advance for the next day which was pretty decent one Reasonable price served my purpose  
N =>  Don t even think about it  not worth it even if just passing through  We chose to stay here because we were driving home from california and got tired on the drive  we didnt need anything too extravegant  we were only going to spend the evening there and then wake up early and get back on the road  The lobby was nice and the price was right   but we were quickly dissapointed when we were put on the  rd floor and it took forever to go through all these hallways that were about    degrees  Our room  when we arrived was so unbearabley hot we had to stand on our balcony  We could not get the air to turn on so we had to call maintanence to get it it running  and it took at least an hour for the room to get remotely comfortable  We turned down the bed and there was long hairs in the sheets like they were not changed from the last visitors  There was no clock anywhere in the room  the tv speakers were blown  and the corners or the rooms where filled with dirt  The worst of the night was that the people next to us were so loud and going in and out of the hallway slamming their door so loud  Time after time this went on through the night  and then at  am they are screaming so loudly at each other that we can hear word for word what they are fighting about   the police came and handled the situation  But overall the location seemed a little dangeous and as a woman i was not comfortable to even leave the room  
N =>  Careful Not a good stay  Rooms were not the best in the world  Not sure if they had double booking issues or kept giving people the same rooms but multiple people kept coming into our rooms because they had been given the same ones  Also  our wake up call was a guy knocking on our door telling us to get up  This place seemed a little sketchy  
N =>  Owner of this hotel is a fraud and liar  After a flight delay  arrived at this hotel a little after midnight which was no problem since I had guaranteed late arrival via credit card  My reservation read  quot NON SMOKING QUEEN quot   I was given a Queen room that was smoking and had a strong smoke smell  I went down to the desk to point out that I had reserved a NON Smoking Queen room  The owner asked if I didn t want the room  thinking that he was offering me another room  I said   quot Yes quot   He subsequently gave me a piece of paper showing a zero charge  I asked him what was going on and he told me I could take my business elsewhere  I said no  I m not going anywhere  I have a reservation  He told me he didn t want my business  I told him that I needed to stay at that hotel as it was extremely late  close to my destination the next day  and that I would call Howard Johnson reservations  I called reservations and they said that they couldn t do anything about it  Even if you exclude the fraudulent cancellation by this  quot owner quot   the fact that Howard Johnson reservations don t even stick up for their own customers means they should be put out of business  I told the owner that reservations insisted that I get my room  He asked to speak with them  saying they had no right to tell him how to run his business  and I refused  I needed someone to take my side  I begged the manager to help me out  he said he couldn t do anything as the owner controlled the entire hotel  I still refused to leave  After saying something like   quot Please sir  I would appreciate it if you could accommodate me  and even though the smoking room was not what I reserved it is better than nothing quot   he remained silent for a couple of minutes longer and finally gave me a non smoking king size room on the first floor  Finally the pressure was off  and I was staying there two nights  but I would NEVER stay there again                                     Stayed         and           
N =>   I wouldn t recommend Was not pleased with this property  We were here on business and had to pick a place close to our event  All around this area were wedding chapels and people walking  It was kind of scary  Everything here was small  The bathroom  you were barely able to get into and the one queen we had was almost at the dresser at the end of the bed  I just felt cramped in this room and wouldn t really recommend unless you have no choice  
N =>  DO NOT STAY HERE    I cannot stress enough  do not stay at this hotel  We were asked to leave by the manager for querying that we had booked a king bed and the bed in our room was a queen  He told us just because we had booked it doesnt mean we get it  I am not joking I have never experienced a hotel or hotel staff like it  We had no where else to go but were told  quot don t worry we can find you somewhere quot   quot if you don t like it you can leave quot  we saw the manager also ask for  quot time outs quot  with other guests  The  nd night the air conditioning broke in the room and we were too scared to complain even though it was     degrees outside  we also wanted more pillows but were afraid to ask  also our tv and lights in the rm did not work  The hotel is right at the end of the strip a good   mins to an hour walk to the main hotels  please do yourself a favour and stay at one of the resorts  we moved to the MGM grand and it was fantastic and cheaper    I have complained to Howard Johnson and I got a free night to stay there again  if I return to las vegas  Trust me if I return to LV I will never ever go back to this hotel again  
N =>   cigarette burns on pillows dirty towels blood in sink     i stayed here because it was the most inexpensive hotel i could find for my friend s birthday  there was what looked to be BLOOD in the sink  the towels literally had dirt on them  the sheets and pillow cases had cigarette burns in them  there was a  quot suspicious quot  stain on the floor next to the bed  while we were sleeping  a large motorcycle gang  maybe    people or more     was outside blaring loud music  having a party and yelling from about midnight until approx   am  we called the front desk about   times to complain and ask them to get security to shut the people up  they refused  then at  am  the motorcycle gang started up again  reving their engines  talking loud  playing music  we called again  still no help  when we checked out  we demanded a refund and luckily we got one  it turns out  that night  because the motorcycle gang was SO scary  several staff members QUIT and the entire lobby was filled with complaining hotel guests  all demanding their money back  this place is DISGUSTING  do NOT stay here  
N =>   Complete Filthy Dump  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life The manager  quot OSCAR quot  was so rude  I get to the front desk and I tell the manager I have paid for one night in advance  He tells me I have to pay for the other two nights up front  I say No I don t I have never done that before and that I will pay for the other two nights before check out time in the morning He got angry with me and told me that he would have to cancel my two nights and if they were still available I could get them but not at the rate I had if I didn t pay up front  I asked him where in his hotel did it say I had to pay up front for all nights he just said i m not going to argue with you its the rule I told him to do what he had to do I wasn t going to pay up front  I usually do this because I want to see the room  st  I AM SO GLAD I DID NOT PAY UP FRONT   The room is on the second floor  NO ELEVATORS IN THE FREAKIN quot  HOTEL    I had to lug   big bags upstairs   I get upstairs and there are the maids sitting and talking and eating lunch in the hallway  I open the door to the room and it smells I look at the beds and the spreads on the beds look like they haven t been washed in    years  Just nasty and filty dirty  I pull the spreads back and see that the blankts underneath are nastier than the spreads I grab my things and go back to the lobby and I tell the manager he has to be kidding if he thinks i m going to stay in that filth  I tell him to go look for himself but he doesnt want to which leads me to believe he knows what kind of hotel he is running A SLEAZE BAG hotel He gives me another room on the  st floor  I go to this room SMELLS  I look at the bed spreads nasty and dirty  I pull the bed spread back and discover that these beds have no blanket just sheets  I go into the bathroom and there is a  inch long COCKROACH  i run to the front desk and tell the manager to come look so he won t think I am making this up  He comes to look and gets a maid to come also  I show him and he says the reason there was a roach in my room is because my room was close to the pool area outside   that is no justification for a big       roach to be in my room   There were no hair dryers or irons in the room like advertised  I wouldn t have used them anyway  The pictures on the website are a smoke screen  The only thing remodeled was the lobby the rooms SUCK He then goes on to tell me he can give me a refund  I say that would be good  He then says well if I give you a refund you have to leave  I was like you re kidding me right This was All Star Weekend with a couple of conventions going also  even if I did consider leaving there were NO ROOMS available ANYWHERE  I was stuck  Luckily for me I am the type of traveler who brings their own sheets  pillow cases and bath towels or it really would have been all bad  The next morning I was out of there  my trip was cut short because I didn t have anywhere else to stay and I am so glad my friend that was supposed to come didn t make it  that would have been so embarrasing because I am the one who made the reservations  DONT STAY AT THIS DUMP  If you are used to staying in nice clean hotels Like I am then this is one Howard Johnsons that is giving the chain a bad name I found out later through a series of complaints I am giving this hotel that they are all independantly owned and they have the use of the name Howard johnsons  If they get enough complaints the privlage of using the name will be stripped away from the owner  I HOPE SO they don t deserve to use it  
N =>  Nasty Nasty Nasty This was the nastiest hotel we have ever stayed in  Had reservations but check in was a big hassle  The lobby was nice so assumed the rooms would be but they were the dirtiest rooms I ve ever seen  have stayed in hotels much cheaper than this one that weren t near as nasty  Room was very crowded with dirty furniture and very smelly  Threw away the white socks I wore the  st night  yes we were stupid enough to stay   nights  long story  as they were black  never took my shoes off the rest of the stay  When I wrote HJ corp  to tell them we would never stay in an HJ again they had the hotel contact me which they sent me a coupon for a free night stay  weeknight only and only that hotel  and I mailed it back and said  quot thanks  but no thanks quot   Also not sure how safe the hotel was  Can t think of one good thing to say about this place 
N =>   What ever you do make sure you bring your gun  I was short on time  I rented two rooms for our group  I requested two rooms with queen beds   First thing when we checked in they gave wrong rooms  Two rooms with twin beds  next was the stench in the hallways  At least they had new pavement  Money spent on pavement would have been beter spent on paint and carpet There was broken glass in the other room  They never did clean that up even after several requests  It is no wonder the Shot Show pesenters did not recommend this hotel  It would be best to dozer it and put a carwash in it s place If you are into watching this would be ok  the prostitute walking down the hallway was different  They also have a porno sore and strip club right across the street  SEEDY is not even enough to describe this place  The photo used to describe this location must have been taken    years ago  Stay at Circus Circus instead  They have a full circus      this place only has a FLEA CIRCUS         Maggie bring your gun    Also free dope in the parking lot   
N =>  Dirty Linen On my first night I wanted to go to sleep  however the still dirty and stained linen prevented me from doing so  The bed had been made over top of this linen   need I say more  I do not recommend this place  I would rather stay in a hostel  
N => About what we expected but worse  Well  I have never cared for Howard Johnson s motels anyway  and the ONLY reason we stayed here was that we were traveling the West with our constant travel companion  our small    lb  dog  and we could not find places in Las Vegas which allow pets  Also  when we called HJ s reservations to inquire about this hotel  we were told that it was one of their Gold Medal Award Winning Properties with nicely renovated rooms  So much for truth in advertising But  it was somewhat worse than I had expected and its billing as being  quot on the Strip quot  is pretty much stretching it  It was on Las Vegas Blvd   however  it was miles to a decent  safe area  The rooms  carpets  furnishings  and spreads  sheets  etc  were not only old  frayed and dingy but just looked downright nasty  I don t believe that we could have stayed there more than one night   our  quot little guy quot  even seemed depressed by it I could go on and on  but you get the picture  Unless you are in desperate need of a hotel room and absolutely cannot find anywhere else  do not stay here  
N =>  Don t Bother   Location Location Location We had spent    days travelling around the southwest of USA  This was one of the worse  Room needed up dating  This is was the only motel in the    days that had a warning about taking the towels  they would charge you if any towels where missing and it included a price list for each and every towel and bath mat  I was tempted to take all the towels to the front desk in when I checked out to prove all towels where there  Staff only just plesant to you  The location     Near the  strip   be warned you have to walk almost a mile to get to the bottom end of the strip in the heat it is hard work and   miles to the bellagio  and you have to walk past other motels that rent room by the hour          Did not feel safe walking around in the late afternoon and only did it once in the evening and that was to the internet cafe to book somewhere else  Thankfully I did not have any children with me  Would not stay there ever again  Went to the internet cafe and booked else where for the rest of our stay  If I could give it no points at all it would be better  Stay there at your peril  
N =>  Needs Improvement   Rooms are old  need renovation  pool not cleaned properly and unsafe  A C old and too noisy  stained walls  I would never stay here again  not for the money I paid  Howard Johson needs to drop this location from their franchise list or get rid of it if they own it  
N =>   Stay away safety comes first  Bad  unsafe area of Las Vegas  My car was broken into in the hotel parking  the GPS was stolen  Hotel was extremely experienced and cleaned the broken window glass quickly to hide the shame from the guests  Security cameras are installed everywhere inside the hotel but none outside  If you worry about safety   stay away  I had to waste a day of my trip and paying      to fix the window  The manager was apathetic    quot there is nothing we can do   quot   quot we are not responsible    quot Stay away  safety comes first  
N =>   Poor Choice for CES Attendees As a travel arranger for our company I made this reservation directly on short notice due to all other hotels filled  My traveler attended a convention and this hotel was on the shuttle route  However  the staff was unaware of the timing or any information relative to the shuttle to get to from the convention and kept referring to going to pick up the shuttle at another nearby hotel  Rooms a bit worn dirty  and staff were just ok  Not a good choice for people expecting shuttle service for a convention  
N =>   Not up to Par This was my second stay at this property and this stay was not as good as the last  Great TV and great bed but the room was a little dirty  The elliptical machine in the workout room had old dirt and sweat and looked like it hadn t been wiped down in a long while  The gym wipe dispenser was out of wipes too  Breakfast was unimpressive  They ran out of juice glasses and charge extra money for eggs or sausage  Some of the staff members were friendly while others were not  Guys that stepped off the shuttle bus in suites where greeted warmly  The staff just kind of stared at me when I walked in like maybe they thought I wanted to rob the place and I m a GP Platinum member who travels regularly  This place also smells  When Hyatt remodeled the property they apparently spend money on new granite  wallpaper and carpet but forgot to scrape the popcorn ceilings in the rooms and the halls so this material holds the same old stale  smokey smell the hotel had when it was a dumpy old Amerisuites  For GP members who need a place in Vegas to accumulate points  I guess it is okay for a night or two  however  I would NEVER bring my wife to a place like this  Hyatt Place still has a ways to go before they are up to the level of Holiday Inn Express or riott Courtyard  
N =>  Ok for families  Don t expect much  Hyatt was good w  our kid  We had to share a room  which is always a bum  Kid on sofabed in living room part  We were cumfy  Bed was foamy  Breakfast was toast  fruit  coffee  no eggs meat  which left much to be desired  Not enough people working to refill coffee pots  etc  Long lines for breakfast  Even so  for price paid        it was clean and nice and I d recommend for families  It s a re don AmeriSuites  Best part was huge flat screen TV  Off strip  and quiet  except for airplanes  right near the airport   Front desk printed out a list of places to take children  which was very nice  and the free shuttle took us to the strip  GREAT   but didn t know info  for the Strip bus     all day is good for    hrs    Drop off was at Planet Hollywood which was fine and close to everything  Paris  and Bellagio   
N =>   Great Place to Stay  We stayed at the Hyatt Place   th     th       while we were in Las Vegas for the PBR World Finals  We chose this hotel because it is close to the Thomas and Mack Center and we could walk to the event each night  The staff was amazing  Everytime we entered the hotel they welcomed us back and asked if we needed anything  Even the shuttle driver asked us if our room was ok and if we needed anything  The free breakfast was adequate  We took advantage of their free shuttle to the strip which leaves every hour during the day until      pm  The rooms are comfortable and clean  When we were ready to leave for our trip home  the shuttle took us back to the airport at no charge  We travel often for both business and pleasure and stay in alot of   star hotels  We were so impressed with the staff at the Hyatt Place compared to other hotels  We will definitely stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a clean  comfortable room at an affordable price just minutes from the strip  
N =>   some issues not a great stay I hate Las Vegas  I needed to stay here for one night and wanted a hotel with no casino  no smoking  and off strip  This was all those things however various parts of the hotel smell of smoke anyway  I guess it can t be avoided in Vegas and since there were Europeans everywhere in the hotel perhaps it was just their complete lack of understanding of the non smoking concept that caused this  The decor is stylish but the rooms were pretty average other than the    inch LCD TV  All the plumbing drains and supply hoses were fully exposed in the room which was very ugly  Also  apparently I had an accessible room and the shower was a handheld type  The handheld unit looks like it was replaced yet the mount was from the previous model so the shower head flopped around and I could not take a shower without holding the shower head  room      Also  I was awoken out of a dead sleep early in the morning   am  by maintenance  He said that his paperwork showed that the room was vacant     minutes later housekeeping came also thinking the room was vacant  They should have fixed this issue the first time I was disturbed  I called the front desk to have them ensure that I would not be disturbed again  This was unacceptable The breakfast was satisfactory  It was motel style fare but that s fine  Bed linens and bed were motel style as well Based on my search of hotels and prices for this stay  I think this place was worth half what I paid  I would say for a weekend in the summer this place is not worth more than      considering all the other options I love the Hyatt Place concept but this stay just didn t work for me  I look forward to trying the Aloft hotels from Starwood once they open in more cities that I need to visit  Perhaps they ll get it right I still hate Vegas  
N =>   Pleasant stay Stayed here after Delta cancelled our flight and booked us in here  Located very close to the airport and the free shuttle will collect and or drop you to airport Reception staff member was most unhelpful when we discovered we had to return to airport and collect a different voucher from the airline to pay for our stay   she wouldn t let us leave our luggage even though the stay was confirmed by DL  Not our favourite person Room was lovely  very spacious  modern and spotlessly clean  Get the impression this is a newly refurbished hotel  
N =>  Gutes Hotel   leider in Einflugschneise des Flughafens  
N => Robbed The place was horrible  Not only was service terrible when we first arrived but we were actually robbed in the middle of the night while we slept  We think someone from the staff did it as our door was locked  When we reported the incident the following morning  we were ignored by security and he actually told us to hope  quot our money may be returned quot   That was all he could did  Never again will I stay here  With the money we lost  we could have stayed somewhere way better  
N =>   Imperial Palace   ho hum Room was decent  low cost  but noisy because of outdoor bar next door till   am  Requested a king got   doubles  Casino had a lot of smoking  cheesey lip sinkers  Central location  
N =>   HATED IT    DIDNT EVEN STAY THE SECOND NIGHT me and my boyfriend stayed at the imperial palace and it was like staying in the ghetto of AC  We opened the window and we were staring at a brick wall  The room smelled like cigarettes  and wasn t even attached to the lobby we had to haul all of our to the back o the hotel out into a dark alley and up   flights of stair into a motel in the back parking lot  NO RESTAURANT WORTH EATING AT  NO DANCE CLUBS  HORRRRRIBLE IMPERSONATOR PERFORMANCES  AND HIDDEN FEE S WHEN YOU CHECK OUT THE SECOND NIGHT WE CHECKED OUT AND STAYED AT THE MONTE CARLO WHICH WAS ONLY    MORE A NIGHT TOTALLY WORK THE EXTRA    BUCKS however Imperial Palace didn t even refund my money for the nights we canceled  RIP OFFFFF  
N =>   DON T BE MISSLEAD i have read all the bad reviews about the I P and the last time i was here   yrs ago  SEE THE CARS   i would have agreed BUT THEY GAVE A GR  DEAL so i went w  low expectations but they have done a gr  job making this place over the room was nice the staff was nice  amp  helpful a little construction here  amp  there but that says   me we are trying to give this old girl a makeover and i think they are doing a GR  JOB no this is not the Paris OR CEASARS but a good value    the only complaint was the buffet was bad    all day eats  one of the worst i ve had they served the lunch menu along w  breakfast   am that does not give much confidence about lunch we   lunch but that was all we could take we skipped dinner  lucy the server was fast amp very good at her job lucy was the best part of the buffet too bad she didn t cook     in closing the i p is a nice value hotel casino w  a very bad buffet stay here but eat another buffet 
N =>   Wedding From Hell We don t even know where to begin   I guess in   when the IP ruined our engagement   found feces and puke throughout bathroom  and holes in the sheets big enough to drive a truck thru   when we complained to the front desk   the moved us at      at night   we don t get an I m sorry   just the website address   all they did was promise not to do it again  seeing the chapel already had our money  which of course was no refundable    don t get us started on the run down  shotty appearance of the chapel  which they dropped our unity candle  that we had to find out by our parents telling us about    Now for the hotel stay     The start   being locked out of our hotel room  for most of the day  making us miss the final Tux fitting and cake decorator meeting   having thier so called securty treating us like criminals  to cover thier maids going into our hotel room  when the Do Not Disturb Sign was hung    this happen to several of our guest  money taken from one guest  FILTHY ROOMS     To Not Being Able to brush your teeth without the water clogging up  and don t even think about taking a shower  without the drain overflowing    THIS WAS IN THE PENTHOUSE       When we arranged with the bellmen concerning our wedding cake  Valet forced the car to be moved  before bellman arrived  causing Cake to be damaged by other guest      never got   I m Sorry  in fact  after we made our incident report in the security office  was told to vacate the premises  we got to the penthouse  and found our stuff was being loaded onto the cart  and as we came into the room  found the bellman had dropped our wedding gifts  and was standing and kicking them out of his way  and he continued to pack our luggage   not even to bother to pick up the gifts      when Hotel Manager finally arrives  after    minutes with security in tow    never an apology  when my bride said she just wanted to leave this mad house  with tears running down her face  on her hands an knees picking up the broken wedding gifts  the manager has the balls to say  he also wants us off the property as quickly as possible    I can certainly see why  with the guest gathering in the hallway  then we were escorted from the penthouse  down the elevators  thru the crowed hoted casino lobby  like criminals  for all to see    shame on you  shame on you    and the worst part  WE PAID FOR THIS KIND OF TREATMENT  In What Universe is this JUST  This does not include the horror stories from our guests    EXPECT A VISIT FROM OUR LAWYER  You deserve it     Gave you every oppurtunity to make this right      SHAME ON YOU     
N =>   Well at least we saved money I have been a member of Harrah s Gold Rewards for over    years  and I have to say that I have NEVER had a stay as bad as this one in any of the Harrah s hotel casinos  The room was okay  clean  and they gave me the extra coffee that I requested  The D cor was straight out of the    s   mirror on the ceiling and everything Negative     We went to find something to eat   granted it was   pm  but this is Vegas and we are at a casino   but finding food was a joke  The hotel s after hour s food choices are the Burger Palace or Ginseng    Bad choices since we can t eat burgers and don t like Korean  Japanese  amp  Chinese foods  So we were forced to go out on the strip to find something to eat Negative      The coffees we ordered from the Cocktail Waitress were watery and almost cold  We don t drink and only order water and or coffee  and yes  we do tip the Cocktail Waitress  Negative      Hard to find  quot Non Smoking quot  sectionNegative      The next morning we went to take our showers and were surprised to find that there are no hand holds to assist in getting in or out of the large Roman Luv Tub  especially since you had to climb into it to shower Negative      The next afternoon after we returned to our room for a rest  we found that although the bed was made  the rest of the room wasn t clean  The garbage wasn t emptied  the coffee pot was not cleaned  amp  emptied  no fresh coffee  dirty counters  etc  We called down and talked to housekeeping about the problem  and they seemed to have an attitude that I was bothering them with a trivial matter  When we returned later that evening  we found that they emptied the coffee pot  wiped the bathroom counter and that was it  Garbage was still in the trash cans  paper bits were still on the carpet  i e  not vacuumed   etc I could go on  but suffix to say that I am writing to Harrah s about this experience  
N =>   Poor very noyse expensive  They put us in a room without soundproof  we couldn t sleep at the first night  then we asked to change  They tell us is a   star hotel but for me  was a   star one  
N =>   We will stay there again We booked a deluxe room under a special mid week promotional rate  three nights           Our room         was clean  comfortable  quiet  short walk to elevators  not luxe by any means  but met every requirement for moderate cost accommodations and had lots of big plush towels  Fantastic fantastic location on the Strip  We had some facilities issues  slow draining toilet and shower  but called the desk and an engineer showed up within    minutes with his rolling toolkit to solve the problems  We needed wi fi which is available for an extra     day    it performed flawlessly  Hotel staff was helpful not intrusive  Elevators were a little slow at times  We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants    but used the coupon book we were given on check in to dine at the Flamingo  Paris  and Harrah s    all right up the street  The Imperial Palace is an east walk  as well  to Bellagio  Caesars Palace  Venetian  Ballys and Mirage  
N =>   wedding nightmare in vegas I searched online for the perfect wedding chapel inside a hotel because i was told you have a better experience if they are connected to a casino hotel  I am familiar with Harrahs and believed them to be top notch with their properties and treatment of guests The wedding planner was very nice and helpful the entire time while making arrangements and planning the wedding so I felt confident my first and only wedding would be wonderful  we booked our rooms at the IP along with the maid of honor  best man  and grooms parents  and sister and brother in law   when we arrived my wedding dreams began to fall apart   we had been told we could choose the background for the chapel that was not true  we did not receive the runner or flower petals down the aisle  we were told they had a selection of music to choose from for our first dance  they didnt have it available for us so we gave them   song choices and asked to be called if they didnt have them  the day of my wedding i asked which song we were going to have  never got an answer and it ended up being a song I had never heard  and the minister anounced it as our last dance  the way everything reads I believed the toast was included as part of ceremony and would be on dvd  it isnt they had our sparking cider and broken glasses in a bag for us to take like party favors  the wedding planner was aware that my parents are deceased  and reminded when we arrived because they asked about them and I broke down in tears   it was very hard to get married w out my my and dad   the day of my wedding the photorapher kept asking where my mom was for pics in the brides room   then even when i said my parents weren t coming they were dead he proceeded to have the grooms mom stand up saying he thought she was my mom  the wedding planner wouldnt let the best man and maid of honor sign the certificate because it had to be ledgible  She then proceeded to put the grooms name in the witness spot so our certificate is full of white out the minister was cracking jokes  it didnt seem appropriate as we had not even met him before the ceremony   I found out his name by reading our marriage lisence We were mislead by the wedding planner on how many picture we were atually getting in our package and afterwards found out why no one was allowed to take any pics in the chapel   the photograher s packages were expensive the wedding planner set up appointments for myself and my maid of honor at the salon located inside IP for hair updo and makeup before the wedding         for that seemed high but hey it was my weding day and we should be pampered right   well they ended up charging us an extra         saying we didnt get basic updo   by the way my maid of honor had to redo both our hair because I didnt even get off the elevator and my tiarra fell out and curls were gone  hers were falling too   The Princess wedding chapel did nothing to compensate us for our disaterous wedding Our room at the IP was a deluxe so we actualy got a one cup coffee maker  but only enough coffee for one cup  we are   adults who drink coffee  the maid did find us a little more one day but told us they were out so we had to go buy coffee and rig a filter in order to have coffee   we were lucky because the regular rooms do not even get a coffeemaker so our family had to either come to our room in the morning or set off to find and buy coffee the faucet in our luv tub didnt work properly couldnt get hot water to come out so had to haul water from the shower in the bathroom to fill it and then the faucet wouldnt turn off so we had a trickle going  the doors on the closet were off the track my husband had to keep fixing then everytime we needed to get into it  the sliding glass door was hard to open and kept going off track too 
N =>   a bit disappointed Was there for a week and upon returning i found that my digital camera was missing  I left it in my room and never used it   Reported it missing but seemed like a waste of time since they didnt seem too interested  Older rooms but centrally located to the strip  just cant trust leaving anything in your room  
N =>  not everybody is disappointed with this hotel I read review about this hotel after it had been booked Most people werent happy I can honestly say ot her than a twenty minute wait to check in I would reccomend this hotel Its not expensive but hotel staff very helpful our room was clean and tidy Under bed could do with a clean though We did have the buffet which got slated in reviews It was value for money after all what do people want for     A good location some people we met where not happy with there room they were moved to a different one I would stay at this hotel again  
N =>   Another Perfect Vacation With Imperial Palace This is our  th stay at imperial palace with the value and customer service on all of our visits it won t be the last  We arrived early as always they got us right into a room   hrs early  i asked for a room with a view  Our room was right over the pool great view but a little loud for us  I went to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms   minutes later and no trouble at all we were in a new room  My wife takes mecidation that needs to be kept cold so they comp  us a fridge in our room for the entire   night stay  The maid service was impeccable everything was spotless and plenty of towels   don t forget to leave a few dollars for the maid it will be well appreciated  Room service took literally    minutes and was HOT and FRESH  And best of all we checked out on our tv and didn t pay any attention to the price a few days later reviewing my visa statement we realized they charged us      less than our reservation price  when i inquired why i was told they automatically change your reservation to the lower price  Well appreciated surprise  just to let you know what a great deal this was i payed      for a   night stay  including saturday  and room service once  Excellent visit we visit every   months as its such a great value we can strech our vacation budget alot further  A                     
N =>  People are hard to please Just returned from a   night stay  our first time at this hotel and too be honest I cannot see what all the fuss is about I did not have any blood on the walls or vomit on the carpet  no probs with the plumbing although it did take awhile for the water to drain after a shower but other than that it was fine Staff were friendly and helpful  room was always cleaned when we returned  never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift   or as our Americans cousins refer to them  quot elevators quot   which usually had chatty and friendly Americans in them We tried the emporers buffet and to be honest quite enjoyed it  one of the few places in Vegas that offered value in my opinion In all honesty for the price you pay I think it is a great hotel and despite the fact that our last trip to Vegas was to a   star hotel I would certainly stay at the Imperial again Vegas on the other hand I have a lot of complaints about and will not be returning to  I dont feel that this is the place to talk about it but I felt strongly enough to email the or and was flabbergasted when I got a reply  which was very polite but none the less  unless things change dramatically in that town I will not get the opportunity to stay at the Imperial again  
N =>  Basic room but a good bargain Was able to book a  quot Deluxe quot  room in the tower on a non smoking floor  Room is decorated like a      s motel  and is rather dark as the only window is a single sliding door to a little balcony  The elevators have stained carpeting and are a little jerky  and the hallways look anything but upscale  But you can t beat the price  My room was clean and quiet  Was quieter than MGM  Slept well  although the mattress was not terribly comfortable  Nice iron  amp  clean ironing board  My only complaint is there was no safe in the room  
N =>  Worst hotel on the strip Do not stay here   this place is flithy and even after changing rooms   times   ended up sleeping in my clothes  They wouldn t even do a refund for the cancellations on the rest of our reservations  
N =>  First time and last at The IP The parking lot is kind of a pain to find  When we went they were having an AARP convention so there was no non smoking rooms left all thowe i requested one They upgraded me to a mini suit witch was nice  Some one on are floor ordered food to there room after eating it they wheeled the table out in to the hall were it was for the whole trip some one on the last day took the table and put the food plates on the floor next to the door  The smoke smell in the game room was bad  It is in a great location but after walking the whole strip from end to end there are a lot of better hotels for the same or even less money  The pool seams like a nomal back yard pool  nothing like the other hotels  For the first time ever going to vegas it was an okay hotel we were not in it very much  If you go to embers the fine dining place there two people can split a meal very easy  And if you are young like we are expect to be the youngest people there  
N =>  Don t Pass this one by Have been and stayed in Las Vegas for the past    years  Needless to say that my husband and I have frequented several hotels  We have stayed in   Star down to   Star and along with us have seen them either age and pass on or age and be maintained  I don t care what you have read or heard but anyone who tells you not to stay at the Imperial Palace really needs to reevaluate their thinking  Their check in service was fast  The room  a simple deluxe  was both larger and cleaner than some of those that we have stayed in at higher priced hotels  We saw two of the best shows on the strip right in the convenience of the hotel itself and were given discount coupons for the both of them when we arrived  Even the show tickets had several perforated coupons attached to them that we used to receive even further discounts in the hotel restaurants which were not bad at all  The location cannot be beat  Every age group was represented and everyone   guests  hotel workers  etc    were absolutely friendly  My husband and I were shocked at what we had been missing  It all boils down to attitude  If you go to any hotel with a negative outlook before you get there  then by all means you will have a terrible time  But if you go with a flexable one  then Aha  You will have the great time that we had  By the way   the elevators were A    fast or even faster than any other hotel we were in  And it is apparent to us that the Imperial is undergoing some cosmetic changes in that everything was clean and shining  The crowd was hopping and we had a blast  Thank you Imperial  We will return  
N =>  Good hotel   great location  I was pleasntly surprised by the hotel  The location was perfect  there was free parking  the rooms were huge  clean and well equipped and we had a great stay The casino was buzzing   and the hotel was a great place to explore Nevada  amp  Arizona  
N =>   Great location mid strip serviceable nothing outstanding at all Stayed here twice and its worked both times b c of the cheapness and location on the strip  Absolutely no frills room in the  quot Capri quot  area of the hotel  a bit longer of a walk to the strip  but perfect for most vegas trips  because who wants to hang out in the hotel room in vegas  Casino in this hotel is not great   cheap hold em tourneys daily  mostly crowded gaming floor  cheesy dealertainers  food is very average  not that I was expecting much  between harrah s and flamingo  I may not know what I m missing b c Ive been to vegas twice and only stayed here  it seems to be one of the main hotels for the cheap airline ticket hotel package deal  Will prob stay somewhere else next time just to change it up  but have no reason to avoid this hotel either  Very ordinary but not terrible  
N =>   Best Value In Vegas I stayed for   week in     and would definitely choose to stay there again on a budget trip  I picked the hotel because I needed to do this particular trip on a tight budget but still be mid strip   and it did the job perfectly  Of course the hotel doesn t compare to those that you would be paying   or   times the price for  which seems to be the main problem for a lot of travellers    however my own experience was that we got checked in really quickly and got a great room overlooking the pool  I already knew not to go for the strip view rooms if I wanted to sleep   We had a small bank of elevators near our room that we only had a wait for on our checkout morning  and even then only a couple of minutes   Our room  deluxe  was of good size  the bed was comfortable  the shower was great  amp  housekeeping did a great job   the room was always spotless upon our return  In short  this is the best value on the strip if you want to save more money for the many pleasures of Vegas  
N =>   Luv Tub Nightmare  Horrible Hotel    Ick I purchased a room for some friends of mine who were driving a long way to meet us in Vegas  Originally we planned to split the costs  and they didn t want an expensive room  My husband and I were staying at the Mirage  but it was booked full  So we thought  this was close   and I figured if I upgraded their room  it might be nicer that the standard rooms  which don t have a great reputation   I was WRONG  Upgrading was a mistake  Their room was actually in the basement  and was filthy  They didn t even bother to empty the ashtray  It smelled like mold and was comparable to a bad  quot by the hour quot  motel room  We are not picky people  but my friend ended up asking them to DOWNGRADE her just to get out of that room  Her standard room was   x better   but still pretty gross  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody  except maybe a    hooker     Honestly    keep looking  
N =>   Great price great location better hotels out there Was my  st time in Vegas so I knew I wanted a central location  that was key  And price was very important to  since I was travelling alone  I had no one to split the cost with  When I got there  check in took a while but when I finally did get up to the counter  the staff was polite and friendly  I was told the only rooms I requested    queen king  were facing the Carnival Court  a very LOUD outdoor bar that has bands and a DJ until about  am   My other option was a smoking room  Thankful that he advised me of the possible noise instead of my being surprised  I took the smoking room  I realize I m in Vegas  but after being out shopping all day and partying all night  I want a quiet room to come back to and get some shut eye  So  off to my smoking room I went Luckily  I was on the  nd floor so no elevator needed  Try to get a room as low to ground as you can as the elevators take absolutely FOREVER  I was content with my  nd floor smoking room every time I walked by the elevators watching people standing there impatiently for easily    minutes  I know because when I checked in  I took the elevator  I couldn t get my luggage up the stairs on my own   View from my room   the cement wall of the hotels parking garage  Whatever  that didn t phase me at all  The room was quiet other than the occasional honk from a car in the garage  and that s all that mattered to me  The showers were good  water pressure good  lots of hot water and plenty of fresh linens  The beds were comfy  no complaints  When I did come home though  I had to wash everything in my suitcase because it smelled of smoke  Not a strong smell  but I m not a smoker  so I noticed it The buffet restaurant in the hotel   garbage  The breakfast was really bad  the lunch bad but not as bad as breakfast  I ate breakfast at Denny s down the street every morning  Coffee s good  egg s are hot  and it s cheap to  and everyone knows Denny s  so you know what you are getting The pool is nothing special  but it is there if you want  I spent a couple hours one day lounging by the pool  They had a DJ playing some good music  which I like  and girls walking around taking drink orders Overall  I d stay here again  but only if rooms at Harrah s weren t available or were outrageously priced  I m in Vegas to be out and about  not to hang out in my hotel room  so I m not one to stay at the more expensive places  these   suit me just fine  
N =>   Nice Stay Just recently stayed at Imperial Palace it was clean and not a bad hotel  
N =>  Close to casinos The room they gave me at first was only partly cleaned  The bed was made  but there was trash still in the bins and used towels on the bathroom floor  Reception was very helpful and gave me a different room without troubles  and this time it was clean  The Imperial is close to the rest of the casinos on the strip  however  in a large place like this one has to expect to do some walking to get to places  Would have had to pay for using internet in the room  which I didn t  
N =>   Dirt cheap great location if you just want a comfortable place to sleep  Right on the strip across from Caesar s  We paid     night for a Mon Thur stay  The room was clean but not fancy by any means  reminds me of a Comfort Inn or similar  Our floor was quiet  when we were there   Bed was surprisingly comfortable  even better than a riott we stayed at in Flagstaff  If you want luxury  go someplace else  If you want a cheap place to crash  right in the middle of the strip  check the IP  
N =>   Not for me Yep  it is everything that as been said on this site  My fourth time to Vegas  stopped in mgm signature last year   this time went with mate  who unfortunately was on a very tight budget  For me  coming back each night to this place became more depressing each visit  We found staff to be pleasant   amp  our deluxe refurb d  bedroom to be acceptable         BUT the rest of the place        Listen  if you dont mind classless tastless darkness   amp  can put up with all i have mentioned  then go for it  Showed my mate Gold Coast Hotel  cheaper just off strip  he now wishes we had stopped there  amp  got the free shuttle bus daily  People who say the dealertainers are good          must have been seeing different to what we saw  but ey  each to there own  personally i have never seen worse  Have now finished with Vegas  but it is a place i nothing but fond memories about  except one place   amp  believe everybody should visit here at least once in there lifetime 
N =>   Horrible     Disgusting    Our room was not clean at all  The bathroom looked like it hadn t been cleaned in weeks  The sink had tooth paste in it as well as the cap to a needle from the people before us  The toilet had crusty stuff all over the seat and the tank  VERY GROSS    The bathtub hadn t been cleaned either  We didn t even have a shower curtain  it was a bed sheet with holes cut in it  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  I will NEVER step foot in the Imperial Palace again  
N =>   affordable The hotel is not really easy to access on the strip  You can see it from the strip but the entrance is quite hard to find  Room service was a bit slow but it was during spring break week  Room was roomy  Overall I would stay there again  
N =>   NEVER again   First of all this  quot Palace quot  is NOT a Palace  My now husband and I booked our trip almost   months in advance  When we arrived at this dump they had our reservations all wrong and we ended up in a room that we didn t book  Our room over looked a beautiful parking garage  When we got to our room the rugs were filthy   the bathroom was absolutely disgusting   We went to Vegas just to get married and have the Vegas wedding we always wanted   but this hotel almost ruined our trip  We had family travel with us as well for the wedding and their room had the pipes literally fall apart and spew black crud all over their bathroom which happened the day of our wedding and caused us to be late meeting our limo and late getting to our chapel  When you walked out the doors of the casino it constantly smelled like sewage  The rest of the hotel was dark and dingy and you had to wait FOREVER to get an elevator and when an elevator would finally show up it was usually jam packed and you had to wait for another and another  We would take the steps down to the casino floor but you could not take the steps back up to your room because the doors were locked  A friend ordered us room service for our wedding and we only received half of the order and our friends needed to be reimbursed  We ate at the    hr burger joint which was very filthy and my husband and I both got extremely ill immediately after  It was a horrible experience and I would never stay there again nor would I recommend this place to my worst enemy  
N =>   Poor check in service The hotel was a decent price and a good location  But by making reservations you have to wait until after the official   PM check in  People who didn t have reservations were able to check in and get hotel keys right away  we had   rooms and only   available by   PM  Then one room wasn t even cleaned after we got the keys to check in  Then we couldn t even get a discount  The noise was also annoying  And the pool closes way to early  We have stayed at the Circus Circus before and had better service and rooms  I would not stay at the Imperial Again  
N =>   GOOD VALUE      NO FRILLS Stayed in room        a mountain view between two wings of hotel  It is also near but not too near the slow lifts which many people complain about  Moved to this room after first being allocated a room almost overlooking Harrahs very loud outdoor music venue    no problem being moved We have stayed at The Imperial several times over the last sixteen years and it hasn t changed that much  no better  no worse  It is a good value  ideally located hotel  in need of some updating but clean with comfortable beds in good sized rooms with a generous bathroom The Emperors buffet we feel had deteriorated by last year but happy to say this year was much improved  though avoid sitting near the beverage station as it can get very noisy when servers are clearing the tables and stacking their carts  we had to move The covenience store in the hotel is very expensive  much better to walk to Walgreens outside the Venetian and buy from there I would have no hesitation to book The Imperial again next time I am in Las Vegas     
N =>   Our stay at the Imperial Palace We went to Vegas for our wedding  We stayed and got married at the Imperial Palace  For the most part our experience was a good one  The Wedding Chapel was great  Our room was clean  We ate at the breakfast buffet a couple of times which was good  We weren t impressed with the Pizza Palace  We had a good time walking through the Auto Show display  
N =>  Great value  When we went to check in  the room in the Capri building with a King bed that we had reserved was not available  amp  they told us that we would have a room with   double beds  I told them that it was our honeymoon  amp  that we had requested a king size bed  The gal immediately said oh  your honeymoon  well let me upgrade you  She asked if we minded being on the side above the outdoor club  amp  we didn t  cause we knew we d be sleeping in the day if at all   For the money it was an awesome room  The only complaint is we could of had was the elevator  I was not working properly the entire   days we were there  Some days only one was in service The pool staff was very friendly  amp  attentive  amp  even gave us a free shot because we were on our honeymoon Overall if  you re on a budget  amp  want somewhere to lay your head down for a couple of hours this place was great  We would stay there again  
N =>  servicable Well  Vegas wasn t quite for me  but it was an experience The Imperial Palace itself certainly doesn t compare to places like MGM  Ceasars Palace  Bellagio etc     that much is a given  but for a neat hotel  in an excellent location  you really can t go wrong  Plus the dealertainers are awesome If I go back to Vegas  I probably won t go back to the Imperial Palace to stay again  I would probably go somewhere bigger  but it certainly was good enough for us btw  Not quite sure why the pool closes      that annoyed us 
N =>  Everything was Great Up graded to suite during checkin room was nice service was great the deals were friendly  The burger palace was reasonable but went up on price three dollars one morning so we went to harrahs breakfast buffet that was the best i have been to in a long time and the nice lady at cash register gave us a coupon for   dollars off for each that made it better The I P buffet was not so good  Room was keep clean each day and personal were very nice  Not in the room that much anyways Do go to Ellis Island for the steak breakfast and also supper but you have to ask for specials not on the menu steak supper       Steak Breakfast       its a hidden Gem 
N =>  No Better Deal In Vegas     We were pretty skeptical from some of the reviews so we were hesitant to stay at the IP  But from the moment we arrived to check out we were nothing but impressed  For the money you won t find a nicer place with outstanding service  We were catered to and treated like the entire time  You can find nicer hotels on the strip but you will pay much more  But you will never be treated better than by the staff at the Imperial Palace    give them a shot     you will be pleasantly surprised 
N =>   Excellent value for money couldn t ask for a better location on the strip This was the first time my partner and I had been to the Imperial Palace  My sister recommended it to me  I was warned not to expect anything like the Paris  where we had stayed on our previous trip  For the money we paid  I wasn t expecting it to be quite so good  Ok so the rooms need some TLC  and the first room we were given was unmade and full of dirty dishes  But after going back to reception they gave us a different room and were very apologetic  Lets be honest  when your in Vegas all you want is a comfy bed to sleep after a long day gambling and shopping  This was definately what we got  The staff at the Imperial were brilliant  The look a like stars that deal the card games were very entertaining  The atmosphere and buzz around the casino was amazing  We did try the Emperor s Buffett  which I wouldn t recommend but the burger place was good  There are so many different places to eat in Vegas  to suit every budget you just have to shop around and try it  We enjoyed our stay so much that my partner and his friends are going back in ch      for a   th birthday celebration  
N =>   Ok for the Strip  My stay at the Imperial Palace was from         to          I was in town for a Travel Trade Convention  I wanted to check out this hotel since the rates were excellent for being right on the Strip but the reviews were  so so   It s certainly not   Star but it was clean  amp  served it s purpose  I was a little disappointed since I knew this was part of the Harrah s properties now  However  with this addition  the Harrah s now has an Hotel for every  walk of life   The cafe  served great breakfast  I also picked this Hotel since it was part of the Monorail system  amp  needed to get to the Convention Center daily  I didn t want to be stuck at the hotel right next to the Convention  although Hilton Las Vegas is perfect   but it gave me a chance to be close to the strip  I also stayed at the Bally s  another Harrah s property   check out my review  amp  photos also  
N =>   Great Stay I read all the reviews of this hotel and was a little worried  Starting with check in  We arrived about      pm and there was a long line at chedk in  But I am a frequent player at Harrahs so I went to the Platnum Diamomd line and ther was no one in line so our check in was quick  We got to our rooms and they were very clean and had everyting we needed  Yes they are in need of some TLC but they were still very nice  We went next door to Harrahs to catch the shuttle to the Rio and quess what  no one in line to check in there  so I guess price does matter since rooms at Harrahs are at least twice as much per night as the IP  We stayed for three nights and had no problem with maid service at all  Now the elevators  Yes sometimes you had to wait a few minutes  but it is a very large hotel and had a lot of guests  They have several banksof elevators  so you just find the ones closest to your room and use those  The ice machine closest to our room was out of order  but the one further down the hall worked just fine We did not eat at his hotel because having been to Veagas many times before I had already made plans to take our Grandson to other places that we enjoy   The purpose of this trip was our Grandson s   st birthday Our stay at the IP was very good  We used valet parking and it was prompt and courteous  It is mid strip and you can walk to everything  If you want a good room on the strip the IP is the place to stay  
N =>   First room the put me in When we arrived they put me in room      which was a   elevator trim    up and then a long walk to   down  The room was old  musty and overlooking a fire escap  I went back to the desk and told them I wanted to change  but was told that that was all they had in a non smoking room  Since it was   PM  I had no choice  I was told to come back between   and   pm the next day and see what was available  I went back to the desk early the next morning and when I asked the lady about a change  as I would not be there between   and   pm that day  she asked me wha floor I wanted and gave me a choice of rooms to move to as she had them ready at this time  They put me in a very comfortable room  clean and near the elevator  Assuming this  I am sure that there were rooms the night before   I would recomend that if the put you in a room in the     numbers and if they will not move you speak to the manager  as the originaly room and location should not be acceptws  
N =>   would book this hotel again just returned today on arrival we were told that our room was a bit out of the way as we had to get   elevators but to come back the next afternoon to get a better room which we did although there was nothing wrong with the  st room it was on the  th floor overlooking the strip it was a bit noisy but this didnt bother us as we spend little time in our room the room spacious enough  the bathroom was a bit small but clean no complaints The dealertainers were good would have like a comfy chair in   of the bars to listen to them  my only complaint would be the buffet only used it once service was poor food average have been to better buffets would visit this hotel again perfectly situated in the strip 
N =>   Just unlucky We were told that Deluxe rooms have a better view and recently renovated compared to the standard rooms  so we went ahead and booked it  However was given one which was not renovated and no views and it was dark  We asked to see another deluxe and room and found that it was much bigger than our room  The stadard room was no different to our room apart from the beds headboard  different shape   be because we booked on a cheap deal  The room had a funny smell and looking at it  it has not been occupied for a long time as we could see the dust off from the information booklet  If you re going to book this place  make sure you request for rooms on a higher floor as they look bigger and cleaner with lots of light  Reception staff were not knowledgable when asked for simple tourist information  not the best customer service  They muddled up our room arrangements  It took my friend forever to try and arrange a shuttle to the airport  she was passed around like a ball from one person to another  We were not keen on the restaurants so didnt  try it  Overall  the location was good for the price  All depends on what you re after  I certainly would spend a bit more on a better hotel even though it s only a bed for the night  But it pays to sleep in a comfy room  
N =>   this was my first time at the imperial palace and i loved it  try to visit all the free activities they have to offer  they will fill your day up completely  
N =>   Great spot cannot beat the location We just got back yesterday  We stayed in deluxe room        The balcony was facing the strip  with the rockhouse below it was very loud  this I knew  and requested  It s open till  am  great for loud and wild travelers  Don t bother bringing any Bon Jovi  they played it   or   times a day   quot So funny quot   Great view could not ask for better  especially for only     a night  It is old but  holding up well  We stayed tues fri check in was fast  The room was a little used  I heard from other travelers to bring clorox wipes  that did the trick  IP does get busy during the weekends  so naturally the elevators were slower  The longiest we waited was    min  There is   sets of elevators  just ask the staff aroud they tell you  We used valet the whole time  real easy just give them a buck each time  it s worth not having to walk  considering your walking everywhere else  Hope this review helps  I took a chance and i m so glad I did  I was worried about the reviews  I had booked our trip   months ago  and was reading the reviews for   months  Recommend to all  Go Steelers  
N =>   Best decision of my entire vacation We are Aussies and it was our first time in Vegas  Stayed for   days on the  quot All in quot  package  This meant that in addition to our room  we had unlimited drinks at the casino pool bars and unlimited visits to the buffet and Tea Room cafe  This turned out to be the best decision on the entire trip  as we saved so much on food and drinks  Was about US     per night  total for   people   Here s a few quick opinions Location  Fantastic  Enough said Room  We had a  quot Deluxe Luv Tub Room quot  which was huge and always well cleaned  Old yes  but more than adequate considering how much time you actually spent in it  Ice machine worked fine the entire time Elevators  Seems to be a common grudge on here  Personally  we never had to wait more than   minutes for an elevator in the lobby  going UP  To be fair  we always took the stairs DOWN from our room  so we only had to wait on our room floor once when we checked out with our luggage  only   mins  Buffet  Forget it  Worst part of the hotel by far  Very Glad not to be paying     each time we went  Avoid if possible Food  Tea House   We only went to the  quot Tea House Cafe quot  for our meals  at least once a day  and food was standard American fare  generous portions and prepared quickly  Can t complain  Can t comment on value because it was incuded in our package deal Staff  All satff we dealt with were courteous and attentive Casino  Old  and a bit stale smelling  But if you don t like it  just go somewhere else  It s Vegas DUH  Dealertainers are great fun and a must see if you are visiting Pool  Fine  Good Bar service and not over crowded  even on the days when it was     degrees Again  to be fair  we did stay mid week  Sun Fri  so we weren t there on the weekend Imperial Palace is what it is  Would I stay there again  No worries  
N =>  Great Location but DISGUSTING rooms  price can be good at the right time of year  This was our third trip to Vegas  second time staying at the IP  Our first trip was great  just my husband and I  The room was fine and had no HUGE complaints  so when we decided to go again with more people  we chose the IP because we had no HUGE problems previously  and for the value and location  you can t complain  Right     WRONG    We went with five people and shared a room and had two queens and brought an air mattress   SSSHHH Don t tell    Anyhow   we arrived around midnight and waited in a line so incredibly long   it took an hour and a half to check in  Throughout the E NTIRE process  the lady kept saying  if you don t like you room  just let us know  Whey would you say that over and over and over   We soon found out  Even with the EXTENSIVE map she gave us to find our room  and about four elevator rides later  and only getting lost twice  we FINALLY found our room  WHAT A DUMP   It smelled musty  but we were looking forward to finally gambling  As I changed into some cuter clothes  I thought the floor was kinda damp  but paid it no heed   We just wanted to go play   Well  around      we were ready for bed  The room was still smelling musty  so we went to open a window   NO WAY TO DO IT   It was a completely sealed room  no ventilation whatsoever   OK  And it was a smoking room   How does a person smoke with no ventilation   Anyway  we all changed into our PJ s  and I laid down in bed  THERE WAS A HUGE WET SPOT ON MY BED            By this time it was   in the morning and my husband wanted to go to sleep so he put a thick layer of towels down and switched sides with me  When we got up around     we went downstairs to somplain and switch rooms  and the  quot manager quot   in a VERY snotty tone  told us we should have complained earlier  And after MUCH complaining they finally switched the rooms for us  No sorry  no comps  nothing  We had to complain and complain and complain to finally get a new room  What kind of customer service is that    In the end we still had a decent time  but the whole trip I couldn t get laying down in a wet bed out of my mind    it STILL gives me the eebie jeebies  UGH    We will be returning in ember  but no way in HELL are we ever staying at the IP again     P S  The tea room  I think it was  is INCREDIBLY over priced        for a BLT  are you kidding me   And the pool is TINY    
N =>  Nice clean room Stayed at the IP for   nights with   friends  We were on the   th floor  Check in was fast  clerk very friendly  Everyone we encountered was friendly  Our room was clean  We tipped the maid every day  I left her one note asking for extra shampoo  Every day after that we had extra toiletries  Room was cleaned late in the afternoon every day but we were usually out at that time  We were in our room one day and just asked her to wait a minute and left so she could clean  My room was comped so we had a nice free stay but would have been worth it to pay  No  this is not a   star hotel but everyone should realize that  It was clean and quiet which is what we wanted  We had breakfastone morning at the Teahouse and the food was very good as was the service  
N =>  Very dissapointed     will never return I read the reviews on here and was a little concerned but it appered that the good reviews outweighed the bad so I gave it a chance  We were dissapointed from the second we pulled into the parking garage  We have traveled to Vegas many times and usually stay at the Monte Carlo  Because of the holiday weekend we deicded to try the Imperial Palace since it was cheaper and we were trying to travel on a budget  There was free parking which was good but the parking gararge was hard to navigate  The walk to the building to check in was confusing and long  You have to walk through the entire casino full of people to get to the front desk  The newer hotels have the front desk and guest elevators in a more private location so you aren t navigating a crowded casino floor with your luggage  Check in was ok and we went up to the room  The hallway smelled like urine and the room is old and dingy  There were hairs in the bathtub and the room needs to be updated  The TV didn t work well and the air conditioner didn t turn off so we froze all night  The bed was stiff as a board and we got a terrible night sleep  The walls weren t as thin as I would have expected and it was quiet which was the only plus I can think of  The elevators were slow and always full  We had to wait for close to    minutes to get down with our luggage when we were ready to check out  The bathtub did not drain when you took a shower so you were standing in water the entire time which was gross since I knew the tub wasn t clean  Wallpaper was peeling and the rooms need a serious update  I will not stay here again nor will I reccomend to friends  We were traveling with another couple and they have taken away my hotel selection privlages as a result of this trip as they were also unimpressed   
N =>  Worst hotel of the holiday   Bathroom dirty with leaking taps  Room substandard with dirty wallpaper hanging off  Elevators didn t work  one working elevator for       rooms   took    minutes to get from floor    to ground in the morning  No option to use the stairs if coming up  Pool closed on sunny day because of non existent threat of rain      charge for internetbe worth       night tops but not       they charge on a weekend  
N =>  Great Value  Every complaint I read before this trip complained about elevators being slow  We didn t experiece this problem at all  If you take the first set of elevators closest to the strip you will be fine  We never had to wait  Other people that took the set of elevators closest to parking had problems where they would wait and turn away     elevators because they were full  The casino was friendly with its payouts  The dealertainers   some were spot on and others    missed it completely    We didn t eat there  but we used the coupons our room came with to eat at Paris and Bally  both good buffets  Didn t go to the pool  but did check out the car collection  
N =>   PLACE IS A DUMP Service was good when i first got there  room wasnt very clean  especialy the bathroom yuck they seriously need to do a better job cleaning the bathrooms and the tub didnt even drain it just filled up they need some plumbing done  beds arent very comfortable its like sleeping on springs  the pool was kinda gross as well  towels had stains  pool smelt strong of chlorine and had hairs and random stuff floating in it  the pool chairs did not smell pleasant at all  the elevators took foreverrrr it got really irritating  cheap rooms but not worth it  better off spending the extra money for a nicer hotel  i would not stay here again this hotel needs to be rennovated or just completely demolished  i would be embaressed if i owned this hotel 
N =>   Clean Comfortable stay My husband and I were looking for a cheap  but clean and comfy stay on the strip  After looking through many options  I found The Imperial Palace  I am always one to look at reviews and do my research before I book anything  I read some good reviews on this place  and read even more horrible ones  I saw great pictures from other reviews  and it didn t seem too bad to me  I was pretty skeptical of course  and was afraid of walking into a horrible room  Well we arrived to Vegas on a Wed  late evening  check in was a flash and we right away got our keys We went up to our Deluxe room on the   th floor  and i could right away tell the difference of the clean non smokey smell up there  Our room was amazing  we had a king bed which was very comfy  and very very clean  and the room smelled very very clean as well  I felt like I wasn t even in a hotel with a casino in it  I don t know why people give so many bad reviews  I guess if you plan to stay in the Capri rooms which are cheaper  and in the motel part of the property  then yes  you might have some complains  But we decided to spend a lil more and go for the deluxe room  For   nights  the whole stay cost us only       We will definitely be going back to The Imperial Palace whenever we head back to Vegas  Its the cheapest  cleanest most comfortable place on the strip  
N =>   Great Value  Would stay here again  We live next to Vegas in Henderson  We decided to stay on the strip for my birthday instead of risk driving home after an evening of drinking and playing tourist  After reading other reviews  we were prepared for the worst  but figured we could stand anything for just one night We arrived around  pm on a Monday and only had to wait   minutes to check in  We were very pleasantly surprised as to the cleanliness and size of our room  We had a king bed and there was still plenty of space for my wife to drive her mobility scooter around  It was a nonsmoking room and there was absolutely no smell of cigarette smoke  Our   th floor room overlooked the pool which seemed very popular There were a few minor negatives though  The elevators were slow and very small  wife s mobility scooter just barely fit   Finding the self parking garage was a challenge  There was no in room coffee maker   There was an iron  ironing board and hair drier though  Overall  we felt that is was worth much more than the     local s special rate we paid  The location on the strip across from Caesars Palace and just a short walk to Bellagio  Mirage and Treasure Island can t be beat  We will stay at the Imperial Palace on our next mini stacation  
N =>   Loved it and can t wait to go back    I went last tember with my boyfriend  best friend and her boyfriend  When we got to the IP it was about              And there was a line up to check in but it went smooth and fast  Our rooms were right next to each out which was great  He had to wait a bit for the elevator  but that was fine because it gave us a chance to meet other people a staff Once we got up to our room the view wasn t the best and there were a few unknown hairs in the bathroom  but that wasn t a problem because we went in changed and headed to the strip  my boyfriend wasn t feeling well so unfortunately it was an early night The next morning I went to the check in counter and advised then that we didn t like our view and the bathroom was a little messy  So apologized and apologized and asked how fast can we be packed up to move because she has two rooms next to each other that we could take right now  When we switched rooms it was awesome  It was a high floor and you could see the strip but couldn t hear the noise  Food was awesome and staff bar tenders security valet and store clerks were awesome As a travel agent I recommend this hotel to a lot of other agents and clients  You can t go wrong with the IP  the location is AMAZING  The day we were checking out our plane didn t leave till later that day  So there was a room where we could safely keep our stuff so we could kill time with out dragging it around We are going back this t and are staying there again  The way I see it  you re not going to SIN CITY for the hotel  you re going for SIN CITY  Less money paid for the hotel more money to do things I give this hotel    out of       
N =>   Terrible place to stay I went with three friends for four days of Las Vegas fun  We had a good time in Vegas but the IP is a dump  The staff was less than helpful and on our last night all four of us ate at the Pizza Palace Restaurant at the Imperial Palace  Three of us shared a pizza and ended up with severe food poisioning  The paramedics were called and we all suffered because of the bad food at the Pizza Palace Restaurant  We missed our flight because of the sickness and the Imperial Palace had the nerve to charge us for the room for the extra day  In addition  never did anyone from management contact us in our room to see if we were okay or offer any kind of assistance  I have tried to contact Risk Management at the IP to try to get the room charge for the extra day to be removed to no avail  I have left messages and then called and the phone just rings  It has been a week and my friends and I are still not well  DON T STAY HERE  The room was overall  quot well worn quot  and that was an upgraded room  The TV was about a    quot  TV Well I will keep on trying to contact the IP management re the room charge  
N =>   Great location and not as bad as others say I was worried about staying here after reading some reviews but we had a great stay overall  It is in the best location  right across the street from Caesers and close to other newer hotels  We had a quick check in at  pm on a Sunday and they gave us a room that was ready  No big waits with the elevator but they were not all working  Our room was on the   th floor and was clean and comfortable  We had trouble with our tv the first night and they sent someone up within    minutes to fix it  Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as was the concierge  Pool area was not nearly big enough and not much shade so we didn t even use it  Had the breakfast buffet once  lots of choices  service was okay  HIghly recommend renting a car for a day and going to Red Rock Canyon and then to Hoover Dam  it was nice to get off the strip  
N =>   Not Worth Your         It was my second time going to vegas and my first time experiencing it the way it s meant to be seen I was over     well  I went with my boyfriend  brother and my best friend and we booked at the Imperial Palace we saw the virtual tour on the website and we thought it looked nice     well our trip finally came and we were so stoked however  from the minute we walked in we knew something wasn t right   check in wasn t long however the person who helped us could have been new on the job because he didn t know anything We were offered a chance to get a upgraded room however we declined it would have been an extra        and we wanted to save as much money as we can    well we were given our key and then told where our room was well come to find out it was wayyy out on the other side of the casino it overlooked the parking structure   we walked in and were immediately shocked by what we saw the tv was a small     television and the TV had a Nintendo    controller hooked up to it  that was weird   The carpet was worn and it left black stains on my socks so I learned very early on to keep my shoes on until I went to sleep  The bed was comfortable the room service was great but our first night there we went back to our room and we heard a bunch of people laughing and yelling and it turns out one of them punched out a window and left a trail of blood out on the floor  whoever that was I hope they went to the hospital  It really shocked me and my boyfriend that s not something we really expected  Well the next morning I went into the restroom and the floor was totally wet   the toilet was leaking  disgusting  we called the front desk they said they would fix it but no one ever came to our room  Besides our hotel room being a complete diaster it was a fun trip but I do recommend staying somewhere else it was not worth your money  trust me 
N =>   Not as bad as made out to be This was our  st stay in Vegas and as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary we wanted to spend more of our money on shows and tours so the Imperial palace was the right chose  Having read most reviews expected a long wait to be checked in   this did not happen we flew from the UK and there was only one other couple in front of us  At check in she told us our room number and asked us to make sure we were happy with it as we were staying    nights  it was fine not posh but clean and tidy  The maids were good and kept the room clean daily and i asked for extra pillows and got them  Did not have a strip view as were informed could be noisey we were on the  th floor overlooking the monerail and mountains again ok  We did eat there a couple of times the Tea room average no problems  burger palace yes the burgers a little bit dry but were given plenty of sauces The buffet only had brunch there fine plenty of choice  Our    day stay there was great a very comfitable hotel yes not ceasers not belligio if you want their services then expect to pay for them if all you want is a clean room to lay your head and get out to explore its a great location to be in  
N =>   Loved it     I honestly don t get the bad reviews of IP  yeah it s a dive   but a fun dive We ve stayed in bellagio wynn  thehotel and a bunch of other much fancier places but this time we blew the budget on ufc tickets so decided to go cheap with the accom   and we are so glad we did The rooms were true motel wuality   but you get a balcony which was pretty cool The pool music was super loud and everyone seemed to be having a great time   sure it s only a plain smallish pool but it was alot of fun I think fun is what sums up IP  It was typical kitschy trashy vegas fun and we loved it  Where else do you get to get dealt blackjack from dolly parton and hug michael jackson I wasn t brave enough to eat there  one has to exercise caution  but the central strip location for such a good price really cannot be beat   as long as it s around i m going to stay there for sure would rather spend the extra money across the road at the forum shops On the slight downside the place reeeeeeked of years of serious smoking dedication   hallways non smoking rooms you name it If you can t handle that look elsewhere  Like everyone else says elevators were annoying but there s a few sneaky ones round the back that went a little faster   but it was pretty frustratingwaiting up to    mins for lifts The bars in the casino are pretty bad too   head elsewhere to eat and drink I actually found everyone from check in guy who stopped for    mins to talk to us about australia   to cleaners sooo polite   much more so than over at some of the fancier hotels   everyone was really lovely and had a big smile for us even fellow guests were great   especially the super drunk ones in the hallways   If you are looking for fun vegas at a cheap price look no further than IP  
N =>   Quiet Room with No View We just returned from a wedding trip to LV  not ours   We stayed at the Imperial  Reviews were accurate and helpful  Location was wonderful  Everything is a twenty minute walk  or    minute cab ride   Concierge found us good tickets to a show  Elevators were slow but our non smoking room  which was actually smokefree  was on the third floor so we just walked down when we were leaving and when we were coming back the slowness was not a big deal  Bathroom was clean although the drain was slow  I did check the linens for hair but they were clean  Plenty of towels and our room faced the parking garage so it was perfect for sleeping at night  Main concern  the lobby was smoky  Many of the newer hotels have MUCH better ventilation systems but it definitely met our neeeds  
N =>   Never again     I was getting ready to go to bed around      AM when I heard a  quot girgling sound quot  from the bathroom  I go to the bathroom and that s when I saw the clogged stuff coming from the drain and the bathtub started to fill up with water and all kinds of grime  dirt and all that was gross and colored brown and black    It would not stop  and no the tap water was not on   and next thing the bathtub was fillng almost to half of the tub   I called the front desk and they sent maintenance up  He could not fix the problem obviously it was that big of a problem so he needed to get some more tools  This is now      Am  We talked to the maintenance guy  he was wonderful and very professional and worked so hard  and decided it was best to be moved   Called the front desk and asked to be moved  explained the situation to them  Guess what their response was     quot I have no room for you   quot  So they told us to ask the maintenance guy how long this was going to take etc   We talked to the maintenance guy and his immediate response was   quot Oh yes they will have a room for you     quot  Thanks so much for this Mr  Maintenance  we would not have been able to convince the arrogant bunch working at the front desk if it were not for your help Front desk people said the best they could do was a     credit on our food  No thank you we said I needed to use the shower and we could not even use the bathroom  For all is concerned staying in that room with all the filth coming up from the drain was too disgusting of an experience  apparently according to maintenance guy the main pipe connected to other rooms were clogged   So he talked to the front desk and said  quot YOu have to move these people  this job could take    minutes or    hours or three days  quot  The fact that the maintenance guy had to advocate on our behalf speaks to the kind of bad service and dismissive attitude provided by the front desk people  So sure enough they had a room for us  But we waited for three hours until we finally got out of our room  since nobody came up till then to give us the key to another room  We had gone down to get the key ourselves but they instructed us to wait in our room  By the time we got into our new room it was  AM  Oh  and we did get a     food credit  I do question the professionalism of the front desk people and management  The fact that the room was booked through the internet and therefore was on a cheaper rate  does that render then some kind of unequal service that we do not deserved to have our needs and our concerns met particularly on this awful mishap   I have to applaud however the maintenance guy who worked dilligently to have the problem resolved  But two thumbs down for the management I stayed at another hotel after that  On the way home to the airport I was having a conversation with the shuttle driver and he told me that he has heard terrible things about this hotel  So there you go  
N =>   Buyer Beware    I booked a package deal through LasVegas com  and it is true that you get what you pay for  Originally  I booked a  Deluxe Room  which was anything but deluxe  The room reminded me a scene from a horror movie  The bed was hard as a rock  the pillow cases had mascara on them  the room was dirty  and it had a wonderful view of the casino roof  The air conditioner sounded like a low   flying bomber making a final approach  Fortunately we were able to upgrade to a  Suite Room  which was closer to what I has envisioned a deluxe room would look like  The room still was not as clean as we would have liked   but we were comfortable and the housekeeping staff were wonderful  as were all the staff we had dealings with  Dining was also a little different  The buffet had good   average food  but the atmosphere reminded me of a college cafeteria  We ate at the Paris buffet one night and found it much more appealing  DO NOT EAT AT THE OVERNIGHT BURGER BAR  If you do   practice your Heimlich maneuver before doing so  We had cheeseburgers were so dry that we could not finish them  There was no dressing of any type on them  and ketchup was the only condiment available at the self   service area  After tossing them I went to the counter for a soda refill and I noticed the staff had mustard and relish available behind the counter  I asked why they didn t have it out front for us to use  The answer was  we have it for you behind the counter  cheap  cheap  cheap  The elevators were SLOW AND OUT OF ORDER  We walked down to the lobby to save time  but waited and waited to ride them up to our seventh floor room  We plan to stay somewhere else next time we are in  Lost Wages  Nevada   
N =>   I ve stayed in better for free Checking in at the service desk was slow  Employees changed shifts while lines were long  and once they finished their last check in they simple just walked away never stating  quot someone will be right with you  quot   They just let us stand there never acknowledging we were standing there  After getting our key and waiting at least    minutes for a elevator to go to our room  we found the carpet was very dirty and filthy  It was the same in the hallways too  The bed spread and curtains were very dull  and faded  and the room was dark  Although the room was over the pool  we requested a room change  The second room was also dirty  The bathroom was not clean  the toilet was dirty  Someone s feces was left on the handle  and along the bottom of the toilet  Towels from previous guest left hanging on the shower  and the tub was dirty  Not to mention    inch T V s Come on now  what hotel still has    inch T Vs  There were no coffeemakers or microwaves in the rooms  and no complimentary coffee in the casino  A non working ice machine and it s     degrees  We eventually requested another room change  We actually had   different rooms  The lady at the front desk stated the rooms were all the same  and haven t been upgraged in about   years  I have stayed in better hotels for free  Don t fall for the internet photos because the rooms look nothing like them now  I would not recommend this hotel to my worse enemy  
N =>   Do not stay here    ever  I could go on and on  but I am still so PO d that reliving it might send me into an apoplectic state  so  I ll keep it short Other than the fact my sheets were clean  I think   everything else about the hotel was pathetic  Service was lousy  floors were filthy  employees  with two exceptions  seemed to not want to be there  most things didn t work properly  remote control  TV  ice machines  sliding doors on balcony  elevators  drains in bathroom  and so much more   food was awful  beer at bar was warm  and other than that everything else was incredibly unpleasant  The reason for writing this review is that some people claim to have had an OK room  I can t believe that after speaking with people who were staying there  and seeing the sour faces on these people  one person told me that his room opened up into the parking garage  yes  look up room     and you ll find he wasn t kidding   So  I don t want anyone falling for internet photos  or reviews from  friends of the hotel  persuading people to try it   it can cause such a let down to one s entire vacation  I ran into two young guys from England who were miserable because they had a non cancel clause  not much money to switch hotels  and they found themselves in a stink hole  A woman told me she had to lay down towels all along the path she took after her shower because she didn t want her feet to touch the carpeting  in my room  the carpet by the sliding doors actually stuck to my shoes I just hope this serves as a warning to everyone even thinking about saving a few dollars  DON T DO THIS  And by the way  I am not a prima donna used to staying in   star hotels  though I have   when I used to travel a great deal for business  I would stay in Courtyards and Hampton Inns and places like those  The worst Courtyard I ever stayed in would be a ten fold improvement over this dump Other than that  I was able to enjoy Las Vegas    by staying away from the Imperial Palace until I needed to sleep  
N =>   excellent situation and value for money recently stayed for   nights  arrived late evening after long journey and didn t have to wait too long to check in  but did find the check in staff somewhat slow and not overly helpful  Having prebooked non smoking room seveal months in advance arrived only to be told there were non available  and yet other member of staff offering non smoking to someone else   took room for the night but requested that be moved the next day and room was made available for us  Rooms cleaned daily  beds comfortable  Hotel is in excellent position on strip as central for all hotels and virtually centre so can get to either end with ease  Use the bus   Deuce    for   hr unlimited use  this takes you up and down the strip  really useful to get to the Freemont Street Experience   not to be missed  
N =>   You get what you pay for   what a dump Great location  That is the only good thing I can say about this hotel  Our  quot deluxe quot  rooms  which were  quot recently renovated quot  were actually renovated about   years ago with what looked to be like junk from my grandmother s garage sale in       The furniture was nicked everywhere  and the chairs in the room had stains on them   disgusting stains  There was a tiny TV on top of the bureau which I didn t hang around long enough to see if it even worked  The carpets were vacuumed but filthy  the balcony had bird droppings all over it  and the pool area was sparse   absolutely no atmosphere  The halls had a weird chemical smell which none of us could identify  I was supposed to stay here for   nights but said no way  and moved to the Flamingo next door  Yes  the Flamingo was more expensive but worth every single penny  especially since we upgraded to the  quot newly renovated quot  rooms which actually WERE renovated beatifully  I m no high roller but it was my vacation  I was here for   days  and no way would I spend it in this       
N =>   Could Not Ask For More I love the I P  Just returned from a   night trip and was not disappointed at all  We arrived very late and our room was not available  were upgraded to a pool side room at no additional cost   It was a smoking room  but you could not tell or smell old smoke in there  The A C worked very well  The room was kept clean  the shower was incredible  I will say parts of the hotel are out dated  however it s nothing that even warrants complaining about  Check in was a snap  express check out kept us out of the long lines  The Dealertainers were awesome  We even saw Michael Jackson giving directions to some lost guests  Can t say enough good things about I P  Perfect location  friendly and helpful staff   We will be back  
N =>   Great location but tired rooms   in need of a refurb I am a travel agent and loved the location of this hotel  but the rooms were very old and in need of a refurb  Bed linen was quite old and balcony doors did not shut in our  st room  We asked to swap and they gave us another room    again the balcony doors did not close properly  quite noisy at night   We gave up and just settled for the room as we were not planning spending much time there anyway I tend not to recommend this hotel to my customers now  but it is great if you are on a very tight budget  Spend an extra    pp and get a nicer hotel  it will make your holiday  
N =>  An unforgettable experience  After parking our car in the parking garage  it took us about    minutes to find the check in desk  as there were poor signs   When we got to check in  we found it fairly quick and proceeded to the lifts  The lifts were very slow and some out of order  With no signs indicating this   One night we decided that we would use the stairs up to our room as we were only on the  th floor and would be quicker  only to find the door locked when we reached our foor  this was the case for all floors   When we went back down the stairs we found the same people STILL waiting for the lifts When we decided to get some ice  we found that the ice machines were broken and that the only ice machine that was working was on floor    This meant everyone cramming in the lift with ice buckets to the  th floor The shower was very powerfull  however  the water took about    minutes to run down the plug so you couldnt work out if you were showering or bathing The room was good for the price  after all  you only really wash and sleep in it  The casino also smelt of stale smoke  Not sure i would want to stay here again  Will try out some of the other hotels  
N =>  Good Casino Horrible Hotel First of all they have what they like to call the  quot capri quot  building and no one informs you until you arrive there that that means a motel in the back of the hotel  There is horrible cell phone service back there  there was hair in the shower of my first room  the TV did not work there are no bars to hang washcloths and towels  yet they ask you to help them preserve water buy reusing them  After I paid     to upgrade to be in the actual Imperial Palace Hotel  the room was identical to that of the motel so what did I upgrade  A quicker trip to the casino  The best thing about them is their location  and their overall layout which is easier to maneuver than some of the other casinos  
N =>  I ll stay at IP next time I m in Vegas My sister and I stayed   nights the end of y  We had to wait in line about    minutes to check in  People seem to complain about the elevators  but we never had to wait more than   minutes for one  and that was only   time  We were on the  th floor poolside  I liked going out on the balcony to watch what was going on at the pool  Everyone seemed to be having a fun time  The casino was smoky but hey it is a casino  It was stuffy inside the casino as well  but I found it to be that way in most of them  Caesers Palace was the worst  I thought I would die before I got out of there  I think the A C in the casino s were having problems dealing with the unusual humidity being experienced by Vegas while we were there  We ate breakfast in the Teahouse   mornings and the food was decent and a fair price  The room was fairly clean and I thought the bed was nice and comfortable  I like that IP is right in the middle of the strip  I would definitely stay there again  It was exactly what we were looking for  
N =>   Great Location From a person who has stayed in many hostels  Imperial Palace is a dream  I opted to upgrade and recieved a king size bed  The air conditioning worked very well considering it was     outside  The room was clean  well maintained  The best part was the location  right in the middle of the strip  You didn t have to walk too far to get cheap booze meals gambling as the hotel was ok for that but other places were better  I would recommend for anyone to stay here as long as they are not expecting the hilton  Checking in and out took no more than  mins  
N =>   Worst Hotel I ve Ever Stayed In I could not wait to leave this hotel  The elevators are unsafe  slow  kept stalling    a real hazard  There isn t even a coffee pot in the room    a very cheap place  indeed   and not clean  No matter what the rate   it is too high  
N =>   Will NEVER stay here again  I read a lot of the reviews for the this place and decided to book because of the price and location   unfortunately  the worst thing about this hotel wasn t mentioned in any of the posts I read  It began to rain Monday evening while we were driving back from the south end of the strip and by the time we pulled into the parking garage entrance  a very rude security guard first told us the garage was closed because of flooding and we couldn t go in  When my hubby told him this is our hotel  the guard tells us we could pay for valet parking and when this didn t fly with my husband  the guard gave us a long babel of directions to get to the back entrance so we could park  We get there  it s blocked  I call the hotel  he gives me  quot employee parking quot  directions which lead to the Harrah s parking garage  we get out  realize we are still on the other side of the gushing river flowing through the Imperial garage so would have to walk around the entire block to get to the entrance  my   year old is crying because he scared  my hubby calls the hotel again and the same guy tells us there is a security guard flagging people through to the garage  but we are standing here STARING at said guard telling people they can t go in  After we hang up  the hotel guy comes out  now realizing no one is being allowed in  though not admitting it during the call   talks to the guard and they go stand in the RIGHT place to flag people into the garage  I read this happens every time it rains and the hotel refuses to do anything about it  even though   other hotels that had similar problems have spent the   to fix it  Needless to say  the lady at check out didn t bother asking me how my stay was  This is a video of what it looked like   it s not even my video but change daytime to nighttime and it s exactly the same  We were even stranded on the side of the river where the video was taken      Other CONS  Smelled like sewage every time I turned the faucet on  Waited a minimum of   minutes  as much as    minutes  for the elevators Long walk from parking to check inPROS  Good location 
N =>   Smoky Room was smoke free but it was too smoky walking through the casino and you can t get anywhere if you don t  Consierage was good  One day we had no maid service  
N =>   Great Location I took my daughter for her   st birthday and was worried about the hotel I had chose  We loved the location of the hotel the best  The check in took a bit but they had a lot of people working and were doing there best so we were patient and it paid off  The room was clean and our balcony was overlooking the pool which was very nice  The only thing bad I ccould stay would be the elevators  Very slow  But other than that everyone was very nice and helpful  We did not encounter any rude workers just a couple of travelers  I would probably stay somewhere else next time just to have another experience but would recommend this hotel to anyone  I would recommend to eat else where  The food was not that good and very expensive  But  there are very close places to eat  
N =>   good hotel Great location and price we would definitely stay again This was our third visit to Las Vegas and we have stayed at Harrahs for the past two years so this year we tried the Imperial Palace as it was half the price of Harrahs and for a change  There was no waiting time to check in and the Room was as good as Harrahs everything was nice and clean and the room was cleaned and fresh towels placed every day  The only slight problem was the elevators there were plenty to choose from but as they are quite small you had to wait a while for one to fit into to arrive  All the staff were friendly and the breakfast buffet was especially good in one of the restuarants  We would definitely stay here again and we stayed for   nights without any complaints  
N => 	 BUCKS A NIGHT     MILES IN THE HOTEL For     in a fantastic location  no one should gripe  But  we did have to walk an amazing distance from the  free  self parking garage  through the casino to the front desk  then back through the casino to the elevators  then down a LONG hallway to our room  The room was clean and well done  a typical hotel room  nothing fancy  but decent  The buffet was closed on the Monday we were there  so we went next door to Harrah s for a        buffet  get the coupon from the IP  which was fine  We were able to walk to the Treasure Island show and enjoy the sights on the strip because of our location  The Internet is    per hour  The pool closed at   p m   what was that about      the concierge didn t even know   Our advice  get a room near the front of the hotel near the elevators  You will save some steps  
N =>   Great Price Great Location We stayed at the IP     and found this hotel to be excellent value  OK it may not have the pomp and ceremony of some of the other Hotels on the strip  but I would prefer the extra     in the wallet for retail therapy shows  We returned New Years Eve    and again no complaints  No lines at check in  rooms clean  maid service could not fault and found everybody to be pretty friendly  Exactly as it was in   Yes the lifts can be slow at times  but why stress  There are more important things happening on this planet to stress about rather than a slow lift   We have stayed previously at the NY NY and the Flamingo  and yes the rooms did have a higher spec but that is reflected in what you pay  I can t fault either of these two hotels  but for LOCATION and COST the IP for us cannot be beat  We return in tember  register your rewards card on the net  we have paid      for   nights at the IP via our rewards card  It costs us more to go to Spain    Believe me it can t be that bad  if it was we wouldn t put ourselves through an   hr flight and a   hrs time difference to go to a room that was not clean and comfortable  
N =>   Not the same Imperial Palace i started with years ago This was like my  th time in    years or wutever  I ll start good  like the room was really nice  a Delux    queens and a balcony  great price thru Expedia  The auto collection up on the  th floor was  as always  kewl  Location is great Now the not good  Parking was a horror  They changed where you could drive to the main elevator with    minute parking while you register  I ended up in the back    and took like forever to get to registration  The whole place is a maze of corridors and signs  different levels  unknowing employees and confusion in general  After registration I just used valet and left the car  The bath sink stopper was broke so water could not flow out  Front desk said it would be like   hrs  Three girls  one sink   you figure  I used a nail file  after breaking a nail  to pry it out of there so we could continue  Went to the Emperor Buffet at      PM to use our   buck off coupon  It closed at    Will open   AM  Whoever heard of a casino buffet closing at   PM  ided to use coupons at the Rio  which there was a free shuttle IF you can find it  After   different employees sending us   different ways and    minutes of stupidity I got a taxi outside and    bucks later arrived at Rio   Very good buffet AND they knew where to catch the shuttle back to Palace   Breakfast Emperor was pretty bad  waited for the omelets  dry and tasteless  We did not finish  rest of food sorta blah or wutever  Still like   bucks even with off coupon  About     of the employees I dealt with were not nice  thank goodness the other half made up for it  There was a        quot resort quot  surcharge per room per day that I knew was to be collected at the check in desk  so we paid cash for that  Going thru Expedia the rooms were paid in advance on the plastic and no refunds  So imagine my surprise when I got home and see        pending on my card  I called  did the push    push   routine  Spanish English  had to go thru front desk to the mgr  It s like        a day they hold from your card EVEN IF THE ROOMS ARE PAID  OMG  it took like   days before it got credited back to me and they still kept        so I called AGAIN and they claim it was the second day  quot resort quot  tax  Come on ppl  get real  Why would they only collect   day at check in when you re booked for two  Plus I remember the    and change we gave  This place used to be happy  easy going  friendly  made me feel at home and personal  At this point     the ppl there have no idea what the right hand is doing as well as the left  The in house buffet is not convenient and not overly appetizing  I feel like I ve lost a friend  Goodbye Imperial Palace  it was fun  
N =>  Some good some bad My wife and I stayed over the  th of y weekend in a Luv tub comped room  Thats why we chose the IP  We have stayed all over Vegas  this was my first time at IP  The first room we were given was not cleaned and still had some items in it belonging to other people  Called the desk  they sent a bellman up and he brought us keys to the new room The second room was much nicer  it was larger and laid out better  Had a balcony  The elevators are the bad point of this property  We did figureout to use the back elevators and walk a little bit more  it beat standing around The gaming was great  Good minimums  good dealers  THe dealertainers are better than you think  Billy Idol was cool and Christina A  was hot  It is a very short walk to the O SHeas casino next door  THey have great gaming also and good music playing  You can also see the outside from you table We only ate there in the Tearoom one time for breakfast  It was good  not great  We ate other places every night  Stay here on a budget  be prepared for elevator waiting at busy times  THe staff and delaers were very nice and check in was a breeze  They also comped our pool cabana when we left early    
N =>  Great Location Bad Service and Value From the outside the place looked old  Check in took   min The room was a decent size  Great view of the pool  Room service was prompt  Convience to every where you want to go was Great cause of the location  hotel was right in the middle of the strip   not bad for      
N =>  You could not pay me to stay at that place again  What a fool I used to be  Now I am older and wiser  A two hour wait to check in was our welcome after working our way past the meaningless directional signs  It was like some cruel hoax  those signs were so wrong  The next morning we gave up waiting for an elevator and decided to take the stairs  not knowing there was no way out of the stairway without opening an alarmed door  lying signs again   even on the ground floor  Luckily  we ran into about    other guests in the stairway who had also given up on the elevators  so the doors to other floors were opening from the hallways pretty often and we had no problem returning to the elevators     to wait and then only have them be totally full when they arrived  It was almost    min  from the time we left our room  right next to an elevator  until we got downstairs  I would always rather take the stairs  but this hotel doesn t allow that  Same thing going up later that day       a line all the way into the casino of guests waiting to get onto an elevator  What a miserable joke this hotel is  I can t believe it wasn t intentional  No mgt  can be that incompetent by accident  Monkeys can do a better job  Next time I go to Vegas  I will be sure to drop some garbage off at the Imperial Palace  
N =>  A dirty grubby tired and dated hotel  Do not stay at this hotel  You will be bitterly dissapointed  After spending hours travelling to Las Vegas  on an eagerly awaited holiday  we arrived at the airport and got ripped off by a taxi driver who took the  quot scenic route quot  to our hotel  On arrival and check in I was spoken to by a very abrupt member of staff at the registration desk  No one at this hotel ever showed us any courtesy and I found them to be very ignorant  When we entered the hotel room I could not believe the condition of it   The carpets were filthy the beds even had sweets under them from previous occupants  There was thick dust at the back and tops of units and the floor in the bathroom was dirty  The corridors are filthy and evry where smells of smoke and stale alcohol  Stay somewhere else      
N =>   Never Stay Again I would never stay here again  We booked online  but the prices don t tell you that you are in the bowels of the hotel  far in the back looking at the end of the garage The room was never made up  no towels to replace the used ones  no soaps  shampoos or anything   left over dirty finger nails left on counter when we arrived  Very difficult to find your way around that place and staff is not very friendly  it s not expensive but would rather stay at the Venetian than in the pits  I actually like the old strip better and the rooms are easy to access   nope wouldn t recommend this place to anything    oh yest  if you weigh over     lbs  you won t fit in the bathroom  
N =>   Dirty Old Hotel The room we were given had no tub and the water would spill out on the tile  the room had an odor like moldy carpet  We changed room which was an improvement  the hall carpeting was stained  The only good thing was it was centrally located around the other   star hotels  The parking was convenient  however the hotel still has a hold on my credit card after I ve already checked out  I wouldn t recommend staying here  unless you stay drunk and don t give a damn  
N =>   Awsome Value Great Location  Unlike all the negative reviews on this hotel i have a positive one  This hotel was great for value  If you expect a   star hotel  book at a   star hotel for an extra        The rooms were clean and just roomy enough   we got a balcony which overlooked the pool   the only downside to thatt was the music was blaring at   a m   great if your an early riser  but not so great hungover   The room service was excellent  this is where we ate most of our meals  food was excellent  The beds were confortable and the bathroom was and quite roomy  The casino downstairs was really nice  not huge   but they had  quot dealertainers quot  where they dressed as celebrity s and pretended to sing their songs   they were a hoot  you can also play poker  etc  with them dealing to you  The Location  again  was awsome   you walk out and your right in the middle of the strip   not a long walk to anything really  If you wanted to get to the other end of the strip   there is a double decker bus called  quot the deuce quot  its   dollars for    hours pass and it brings you to both outlet malls and freemont street  with random stops all the way up the strip    i suggest this bus other than the city buses or trains    those were sketchy   We went to one show   the Improv at Harrah s   was the cheapest one and we had a blast  the comedians were hilarious  but make sure you go to the      show   we went to the       show and it wasnt even full which made it less fun  the      show was packed  We went to all the attractions   The Secret Garden The Mirage    Eifell Tower   Stratosphere   Freemont Street   and the little shows outside each hotel that go on at night  They were all great  I would definitly reccomend this hotel if your planning on getting out and seeing the world  If your on a vacation to sit in your hotel room   go somewhere else  
N =>   Great Location  We booked a   nite stay through Allegiant Air as a package deal  Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous  When we arrived we got our choice of room location and the horror stories of the rooms in the back were unfounded  Our room was neat and clean and not noisy  No fumes from the garage area The buffet wasn t elaborate like some hotels but the food was good As with everything in Vegas you do have a lot of walking in ALL the hotels to get to your room   This hotel could use some updating but the location was great  Other major casinos were a short walk away or you could catch the tram behind the hotel We will stay at this hotel again     
N =>  OK but the layout is confusing  We had lots of trouble navigating  There were different elevators  for different floors  Too much walking for elderly  We had to go up an escalator  then down another to get to the parking deck   Very confusing  Elevators were not large enough  
N =>   Eat elsewhere  This may be a little old  but I understand things have not improved  My wife and I flew to Vegas intending to stay a few nights there and then drive to Death Valley  Lake Tahoe  Yosemite and San Francisco  The second day there we had sea bass for dinner that was heavily spiced  We were both ill  but my wife suffered very badly  the effects lasting about a week  Our flight over the Grand Canyon was completely spoiled  as was the drive to Death Valley  The service at the hotel was almost non existent and there was no help in finding one s way around it  The room was fairly clean  but not what we would hope for  Like most of Las Vegas  the exterior was showy  but the casino and interior were tatty and had no atmosphere  
N =>   Better Than We Thought It would Be     My husband and I just got back a few days ago from a   day    night trip out to Vegas  We are not  quot big quot  spenders when it comes to gaming  however when we entered in our Total Rewards card   back in uary  we were shocked to find that the Imperial Palace was going to comp us every night of our stay except for Friday night  a steal at       We didn t hesitate to book the trip  though we have to admit we were pretty worried about what this  quot Free quot  room would be like  Previous reviews have given horror stories about room conditions  so we were more than prepared to slip a     to the front desk clerk if they were going to put us up in a Capri room  to try and upgrade  Turns out  we could not have been any happier with the room they gave us    th floor  simple but clean  with a fantastic view of the strip and looking right down over Harrah s Carnaval Court  which if you are not a heavy sleeper or like to go to bed before  am is not helpful with getting a good night s sleep   The water pressure in the shower was unlike any other I have ever experienced nice and strong  and never wanted to leave the shower once I got in  Staff was very friendly  pool facilities were adequate but not flashy  and it is a bit difficult to find the first time around  consider yourself warned   We had breakfast at the Teahouse and also at Betty s  both places did the job  but again nothing too extravagant  I would like to mention as an extra bonus to check out the poolside luau and show on Tuesday and Saturday nights get reduced price tix from inside O Shea s and you can save         per person off the VIP package  We really enjoyed the show and dinner  Of course you CANNOT beat the location of this hotel  The only negative I would have to state that really ate up time  especially the morning we were checking out  was how incredibly slow the elevators were  Twice it took us over    minutes  no joke   to get an elevator that wasn t packed to capacity  All in all  we would not hesitate to recommend the IP to anyone looking for a clean  friendly place to lay their weary heads and bodies down after a long day of gambling and walking  Better than we thought it would be  
N =>   Very bad customer service and Watch out for your incidental charges Very stern receptionist who wouldn t listen to our questions  just kept saying  quot Next in line quot  I paid for supposedly a  quot DELUXE plus quot  Suite but TV was broken we were switched to another room which had electrical problems After my trip when I reviewed my credit card  they graciously charged an extra     charge  which they admitted was a mistake  but would take at least five business days to refund     WATCH OUT    
N =>   ITEMS STOLEN FROM ROOM WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD  My husband and I are easy to please but this was like hell  My husband has to take medicine for an illness  We specifically remember leaving the bottle of pain medicine on the table because he would need it after we returned  IT WAS GONE  EVEN THE   LOSE PILLS THAT WERE RESTING ON THE TABLE  The hotel police assured me that we both have just been drinking and his employees have done nothing  The investigation done was a joke  Then a fire siren was under repair during the time we were sleeping  daytime      it took   hours  The next day there was some kind of drillling for constuction on the floor above us  The casino took forever to bring complimentary drinks    per hour  We didnt get any sleep and my husband had to finish the trp in pain  The problem is the quality of staff they hire  I dont think half of them would pass a background check  We were fine with the hotel smelling musty and being very old  we were trying to save our money for spending but I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN                       IMPORTANT NOTE              Stay away from those timeshare presentations that give you a free show for attending  The Wyndham Manager was very sleazy  we signed a mini contract saying if we stay for   hours we get the show tickets  They wouldnt let us leave without buying time share and when I tried to tell him we signed a deal in writing he stated   quot I dont care what that paper says if you dont sign your not getting any tickets  quot  After   hours      HOURS    we finally were given some dumb impersonation show tickets and not the Cirque ones we were promised  
N =>   Loved it  We spent   nights here in the delux love tub room free on comps  amp  loved it  We had great housekeeping service every day  Fresh linens everyday  All staff was very friendly  amp  helpful  Wasn t impressed with the burger place but spent most of our time out  amp  about so found other places to eat  Check in was the only bad part of our trip  Spent about an hour in line  Would recommend to anyone  
N =>   What do you expect for     night  We got a ridiculous deal through one of the travel websites and once flights were out of the way  the hotel worked out to     night  Split that between   guys that were looking for a launching pad for the party that is Vegas   and you can t beat a deal like that  Anyways  getting to the useful information Check In   We got there at  am on a Sunday   line up was huge and not moving at all  One of the clerks was busy telling every person that came to the counter her life story and literally in the time it took to get one person checked in   the other girl did three  So tried the old slipping the     bill in with the id credit card trick   she didn t even take the money and didn t even acknowledge us when we asked if an upgrade was available  First time ever that has happened to me  Room   Well   it was hotel room that I m pretty sure looked the same as it did when I stayed there last time      years ago  But really  for the amount of time we spent there   it was perfect  There was a little deck to stand on while we smoked  the a c worked like a charm even if it was a little noisy  TV was small but worked fine if you wanted to find out how to play Blackjack or something  Cleaning service was great and efficient  left us extra towels when we asked for them and even an extra garbage can that we used as a cooler  Elevators   Brutal and slow   always packed around check in time and not a lot of room to begin with  When you put the four of us in it   there wasn t much room and we re not exactly fatty fat fats Pool   One pool and one hot tub   hot tub in   plus celsius weather  no thanks  The little waitresses were quick and seemed to know exactly when your drink was ready to be refilled   but look out man  when you re used to drinking for free at the machines tables   it get expensive when you sign off on a few buckets o beer  Food was perfect for poolside  Burgers and dogs  Music seemed like we had time warped to the    s but that was fine  Who doesn t want to hear a little old school Motley Crue when you re drinking in the sun by the pool Dealertainers   These guys are money  Not one of them would pass as the actual celebrity that they re impersonating  but to be able to stay in character while dealing cards   like when Michael Jackson does a little spin when the house gets Blackjack   too funny  Nightclub   With your room key you get free access to the bar across from the lobby   it s worth a look but I ll say this  I ve never been  quot hey baby quot d by so many  um  working girls in my life in one location  Ugh    ent crowd though  We were there Sunday through Thursday night and stopped in there for a while each night  It s always a busy scene and not as fru fru as some of the other clubs in Vegas  Shuttle Service   To airport Freemont anywhere   non existent    Restaurants   We ate at the Teahouse on the first day after check in   and it s a lot like a meal you d expect at a truckstop  Lots of food  and you walk away full   but it s not gourmet by any means  Here again  you get what you pay for and for the    I spent   I was satisfied Location   Perfect  Monorail is right there   Freemont is a     cab ride if you want  You re close to the Fashion Mall if you have to pick up stuff for friends back home I d definitely recomend this place to guys that were going for a stag party and just need a staging area for the night s activities  I d post photos   but for this trip what happened in Vegas   stayed in Vegas     
N =>   Do not STAY HERE TERRIBLE  Stayed here before that is why we returned hotel dirty gone down hill half of the restarants are closed room dirty found long hair alot in my bed and did not get the suite i ordered pool never any chairs opens late great location to strip put a charge on my sons credit card that never happened still awaiting credit Do not take the stairs down no way out no fire doors have to come back up and bang on door hopefully someone will open it for you elevators old and very slow You have to pay for ice now from machines Very disappointed will not return and tell my friends not to I hear New York hotel great  
N =>   Not the worst I have stayed at but could have done better for the money We arrived on a Wednesday mid afternoon so check in was fairly quick  The staff was friendly at all times but the hotel lacked in so many other ways it would be hard to recommend  The layout for the rooms is crazy and as others have noted  the elevators are slow and many times only one working out of    Room was clean  beds were comfy but I was really surprised to see a    quot  TV  I thought they were all dead  bring your own shampoo and conditioner because what ever they provide will tear your hair out  The food is overpriced and nothing less than terrible  I would suggest eating anywhere but there  If you have a folding cooler bag  pack it  That way you can at least keep drinks and snacks in your room  The location is good and that is a plus  Easy walking distance to great hotels and places to eat   The buffet at Treasure Island is really good and less than          The gaming was not too bad  but I prefer O Shay s right next door  We chose it because we didn t want to spend much on the hotel to leave more money gambling  Next time I ll stick to my favorite  Golden Nugget downtown  
N =>   Not great but works if you re on a budget or in a pinch  I would say the customer serive we experienced was pretty average  The elevators were always incredibly packed  The room was very outdated and not very clean  There were some little hairs in the bathroom and some weird pink stuff I had to wipe up  I had some other family stay in the hotel on the same floor as us  My sister said her room was disgusting and my brother said his shower leaked  It s not a great place to stay  but I doubt it s the worst out there either  It worked for us because we were looking for something cheap on the strip  but I don t think I would stay here again  
N =>   I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy After reading several reviews before my recent trip to Las Vegas I still decided to go with the Imperial Palace  After all I was thinking it is just somewhere to rest my head while I am out and about on the city  Well let me start of by saying when we arrived at the hotel around  pm  There was a long line for check in and only   desk agents  We waited roughly    min to be checked into our room  After this long wait we were given wrong information from the desk agent as to which set of elevators to take  So we take the first set as instructed by the front desk  We then had to walk around the   th floor for    min before we found our room  So we arrive at the hotel at  pm and step into our room for the first time at   min til   pm  Keep in mind this is just night one  Well we shower up and get ready to herad out for the night  One good thing about this hotel is the shower head pressure  Very nice shower  Anyway we make our way out  we loved the location of this hotel  we were near Harrahs Carnival Court  Jimmy Buffetts margaritaville  caesars  mirage  flamingo  all within   min walk  After out first night out we head back to the IP and want something to eat  Well the only thing open is the overpriced Burger Palace  The burger was so so  fries were cool and had been sitting  We wake up the next day to find out that for whatever reason our buffett was closed for the day  Embers the  quot nice quot restaurant of the IP does not open til  pm neither does the pizza palace  So once again if we wanted food we had the only option of the burger palace  We declined and went next door to Harrahs for the buffett  Which was awesome  Food quality and selection was awesome  After several more days of being unsatisfied with the IP we were on our way home  or so we thought  we were bumped from our flight and had to get another room for one more night  we well chose the Excalibur  and loved it  We regret not chosing the Excalibur for the entire trip  I guess the moral of my story is if you want anything good in Vegas it is not at the Imperial Palace  Not only would I not recommend this hotel to a friend I would not recommend it to my enemy  Any fun we had or good food we ate did not come from this location  Thank goodness we were close to actual nice places  I wish like the other outdated places in Vegas the IP would be torn down and make room for something a little more upscale  
N =>   Definetly didn t stay for the elevators  This hotel is in a prime hotspot location  The price was great and definetly affordable BUTfor the amount of people and rooms that this place has  they NEED to get their elevators fixed  This hotel is weirdly designed since you have to walk through a maze to get to an elevator to get to your room  but when you find the elevator you have to wait an addititonal    minutes to get a ride in it  
N =>   Reasonable accommodation in great location I stayed at Imperial Palace from Wed    to Wed     and managed to get a great deal online which worked out at less than      for   nights in a Deluxe Room Check in was on a Wed morning   I checked in   to   hours early which was no problem   there was around    mins wait for check in The put me in a room with a view of the mountains  not the older Capri tower    the advantages of this were that the noise levels were fine and I was close to the Monorail plus the back entry to Harrahs Apparently the rooms on the strip side get some loud noise from the night club until the early hours of the morning The room itself was very basic and whilst everything was clean comfortable it was definitely the most budget room I have had in all my visits to Vegas   although this is comparing to Bellagio Signature at MGM Planet Hollywood Ballys Excalibur For someone travelling on their own and not planning on spending much time in their room but wanting a good location   I think Imperial Palace is a good option If you are travelling with a partner I would recommend upgrading to a nicer room or even staying somewhere else The layout of the Imperial Palace is a bit confusing at first but eventually you can figure it out The casino is quite cramped and a bit worn down compared to other casinos on the strip   it does have a good atmosphere especially with the  Dealertainers  who not only are dealers but each play the character of an entertainer and get up to sing a couple of songs throughout the evening   the Freddy Mercury and Elvis Presley characters always seemed to attract a crowd The sportsbook at Imperial Palace is actually located on the third floor   would have been one of the worst sportsbooks on the strips and even though it is quite large never seemed to have more than   or   people there   they were unable to take bets on any Boston Celtics games because the CEO of the Harrahs group is associated with the team   so this often meant going somewhere else anyway The poker room was not bad but was also quite hard to get a game at times The restaurants at the hotel were not that great   the buffet was the worst I have had in Vegas as far as variety and service went   the Pizza place was ok but nothing special   Burger Palace which seemed to be their only    hour restaurant made reasonably good burgers   I often ended up venturing next door to Harrahs or O Sheas for something quick to eat  
N =>  Worst hotel on the strip We stayed at Imperial Palace and did not like anything about it  First off when we go to check in there was a long line with only   people working at the counter  Once it was finally our turn  we were surprized to find out that there was a      security deposit  leaving us with less spending money for the week  DO NOT EAT AT BURGER PALACE           McDonalds is a   star restraunt compared to that  We tried the Emporers Buffet  not horrible for the price  The casino  pool  and restraunts are rather boring compared to all the other hotels  The rooms are old and somewhat drity  My feet were BLACK just from walking in our room  No exaderation but it took nearly    minutes just to get from the front of the hotel to our room  The hallways are so long and windly its a maze to find anyting in that hotel  Took almost an hour just to find our room when we checked in  We had   people staying there between   rooms  All   keys simutaniously stopped working  Leaving us to walk a mile to the front desk to get a working one  to walk a mile back to the room  Spend a few extra bucks to get a nicer hotel it would be worth it  
N =>  Great Location My sister and I take a vacation in Las Vegas every year but normally stay downtown  We decided to try staying on the strip for the first time this year  We had a great package deal for IP  The Imperial Palace is a great location  We were able to walk around and still go back to our room if needed  The hotel room condition was old but it was clean  The housekeeping staff was great  They always asked if we needed anything when passing them  I look forward to staying at IP again next year  
N =>  Old but comfortable in a great location  Stayed   nights last week and was pleasantly surprised on first impressions  Room was clean but basic with a balcony overlooking Harrah s pool which was a bonus  Found it difficult to sleep because of the noise of A C  at least it worked  and the outrageous volume of the music from Harrahs  I enjoyed the Casino with the dealer entertainers very professional  and there was no shortage of waitresses bringing you free drinks   dont forget the  tip tho   Swimming pool was good for a chill out with no shortage of towells and beds  Best Restaurant we went to has to be Voga at the Flamingo where they transform what seems to be a basic meal from the menu into a gastro delight   quot Legends in Concert quot  at Hurrahs was brill but i suggest you buy tickets  as for all shows  from one of the many     price ticket booths you find along the Strip Overall  IP is a cheap and cheerful place to stay  
N =>  What at terrible experience I am a dimond member first time staying at Imperial Palace  I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or anyone to stay  I was promised by a rep with all exiting and great strip view room  I was totally exited and cant wait to be there  but when I got there  things totall different from what I was offered and was never fullfilled the satisfaction  Unfriendly staffs  frontdesk supervior was not very helpful  all she did was to apoligize  Looking for my room like it was going thru a maze  Elevators were down and it took us between     minutes to get down  Room was dirty  very small for a delux suit for a double queen beds and a small TV  I give a tremondous credits for celebrity dealers though  They worked really hard to put on a show every night  
N =>  Great experience We stayed the week of il   th  We wanted a good inexpensive clean place to stay with a good location  so we could afford as many Vegas experiences as possible  The location was wonderful   It is located in mid strip  next to Harrah s  We had no problems or complaints  Rooms were just the right size  clean  and comfortable  Staff was friendly and helpful  We had plans to see Vegas  not sit in our rooms  We never made it to the pool or experienced the other amenities  There were six elevators near us and three more around the corner  but each morning they were packed with visitors on their way to check out  Later in the day  we never had to wait  Our room was quiet  The rooms facing the strip may hear the noise from the streets  There is music playing from several nearby locations on the street  Hey  this is Vegas   We had a great experience and can t wait to go back  
N =>  Don t Bother Unless You Just Want Cheap  The updated rooms aren t bad but the service at Imperial Palace hotel staff is poor  They messed up my reservation by showing I checked out a day early and then rebooked my room to someone else  I came back to the hotel to find someone sitting in my room waiting for their friends to got their room rebooked  I m just glad everything in my room wasn t stolen  They offered a     dinner but that didn t even cover the food and liquor in my room I had to throw out   It is in a very good location on the strip though  
N =>   Old run down hotel in a good location  I wish I would have started here before making reservations  The hotel was old    years ago when I stayed there and I don t think anything has been done since  If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and you are doing everything elsewhere  then you may not mind staying if old and slow doesn t bother you From the time we arrived with our luggage in tow to when we left we were constantly harassed by the staff pushing Tahiti Village  Every time we passed the booth to go to the elevators we were asked  It got old very fast  They try to bribe you with show tickets to sign up for the tour and sales pitch  typical time share stuff The elevators were slow  luckily we stayed on weekdays when it was not as crowded  The Buffet cost was too much           however the prime rib was excellent  especially don t go if you are looking forward to the seafood  it was all served on ice The rooms were outdated with mirrors on the ceiling and the Luv Tub was just a big bathtub with no jets  should have asked ahead of time  The bathtub had missing caulk and what appeared to be mold growing in the corner We went downtown to the Freemont Experience and decided that for the value and what it had to offer we would stay downtown next time  much more activity and fun  
N =>   I was surprized    it really was OK We arrived for check in at      am  No lines at check in  We had reserved   smoking and   nonsmoking room then decided we would rather have adjoining rooms  I m a no smoker but would give in so we could all be together  They accomodated us Got smoking rooms        amp     facing the pool  The rooms were OK  Pretty generic  Had an old tv but it had cable and a good picture  Carpet was worn with a few small stains  You really couldn t tell it was a smoking room  Had a balcony with a sliding glass door which we loved   nothing like fresh air  One bad thing   I looked at my bedspread  amp  I saw what appeared to either be dried mustard or puke  The housekeeper was just down the hall and I asked her to come in  amp  see this yellow stuff  She freaked yelled  quot oh my God  oh my God  It was another shift  Oh my god  quot  She immediately pulled the bedspread off  amp  it was replaced with a clean one apologizing prufusely  Bathroom clean  Water pressure very good  The Main elevators are very slow but if you go past the gift shops up to the escalators  toward the monorail station  then up another escalator to the  nd floor  there is another set of elevators that were alot faster  Yes it really is maze  like but worth it  Our room was very close to this set of elevators so we really didn t have to wait at all our whole trip  The casino was fun  I didn t think it was dark or smokey at all  I thought Harrah s was the smokiest casino we went in  Waitress service was good  The pool was clean and spacious  Always plenty of chairs available  Hot dogs and hamburgers are grilled by the pool        for a    lb hot dog good  too  I ate the brunch buffet once  It was OK not bad just OK  We stayed there because the room was comped and they offered me a      Macy Gift Card  The location is great  Would I stay there again  Probably  if it was the only free room I could get in that part of the strip  I asked for a late check out    pm and got it  The casino host printed our boarding passes for us  Over all service was good and everyone very pleasant  It s just an old hotel that really is showing it s age  I was expecting it to be alot worse but it really was OK  You get what you pay for  You want cheap  Don t be afraid to stay at IP  It really was OK  
N =>  Find somewhere else to stay     I arrived with a group of    women to enjoy the strip and some much needed Girl Time  The front desk had all the reservation screwed up and insisted we all give our charge card numbers  even though the rooms were all paid by the organizer  The restaurant left a whole lot to be desired  We ended up eating at other hotels  Denny s  Panda Express  McDonalds  anywhere but here  My roommate and I were on the   th floor  if the elevators weren t slow        minute wait  they were broke  we actually took the stairs  guess you can say we were on the  quot loud quot  side of the house  Two druken bridesmaid s decided that  AM was the perfect time to have an argument that escalated into a fight outside of my room  The only positive was the friendly housekeepers when you asked for something that should have already been in your room  
N =>   You get what you pay for  When our travel agent booked us here we were excited about the price and then come to find out  there were so many people we knew who stayed here and said it is the only place they stayed in Vegas  They all told us it was an older hotel  but was clean which is all we cared about  not to mention the location  we are NOT picky people  However  We were really disappointed   and it takes a lot to disappoint us   Our first day we had to be moved because sewage backed up in the bathtub and it STUNK    Management was very gracious about moving us  however the next room we were moved to didn t have the greatest plumbing either    sink bathtub didn t drain  The carpet was stained and there was a cigarette butt outside of our door in the hallway for THREE days that didn t get picked up   YUCK  Just goes to show the cleanliness of the housekeeping staff   I also had a bad experience with the watistaff on the floor  My husband  amp  I were playing slots for almost an hour and didn t have a waitress  so I cashed out to seek service and was told that it was shift change  which was understandable  however  the waitress that took my order followed me back to BE SURE I was gambling and stood behind me to watch and make sure I put my voucher back in the machine like I was a child  I m in my late   s     I was appalled   I ve stayed at the Excalibur prior to my visit at the IP and would definitely prefer to stay there over the IP in comparison to the value  not to mention there is more entertainment there than the IP  The pool was not open and it was the second week of il  which is pool season in Vegas  Packed my bathing suit for no reason  If you prefer to stay at a hotel where things are going on and you would prefer cleanliness  I wouldn t recommend this hotel
